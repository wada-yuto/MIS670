  - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
  but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
  - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
  - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
"  - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)"

  your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
  you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
  I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
  Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
"  okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
"  aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
  that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
  Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
  4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
  just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
  what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
  thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
  Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
  hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
â€œ : @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.â€ù Me and JetBlue are #BFF _Ÿ™è
  no m'good. Just get me home
  thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
  Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
"  ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate"
  thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
  all day
  how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
  why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
  Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
  thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
  yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
  WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
  If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
  thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
"  yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
  Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
  thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
  Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
"  I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
  the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
"FYI,  : The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
  I think I have it selected already â˜ºï¸è
"  last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."
  thanks for answering my questions!
  that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
  I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
   I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
  I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
"  I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?"
  finally! Finally!
"  Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
  anything serious I should worry about?
  cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
  Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
  Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
"  Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
  Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
  the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
"  sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
  This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
  I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?

  flight 2008
  Pittsburgh
  you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
  so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
"  if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
  do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
"  they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
  flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
  What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
"  if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
  once you go blue you don't go back
  why are there so many delays to north east cities?
  kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
  I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
"  Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
  why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
"  what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
"  For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
  never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
"  from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
  it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
  Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
"  you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
  a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
  being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
  of my tray table is broken what do i do?
"  Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!"
  thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
  the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
  5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?

  What confirmation number?
  You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
  You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2

  Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
  exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
  thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed

  at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
  thank you guys! You are the best! _Ÿ™Œâœˆï¸è
"  You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue."

"  You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."

  118 to Boston still sitting
  now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
  hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan _ŸŒ´
  thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes â˜ºï¸èâœˆï¸è
  I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
  I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
  should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight _Ÿ˜•
  early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
"  backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!"
  your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
  you guys rock!
  my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail â˜º_Ÿ‘ç_Ÿ‘ç
  Awesome! #bestairlineever
  no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....

"  When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ."
  I only fly Jet Blue
  Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
  Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
  thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
 's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
  still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
  thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
"   I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
  if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
  I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
"  If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
  our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
  I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
  also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
  #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
  I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
   Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
  any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
  Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
  I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
  what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
"â€œ : @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!â€ù Thank you!"
  My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
"  According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
.  thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
  At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
"  flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
  thanks! Have a good Sunday.
"  Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"

  nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
  thank you. We are finally at the gate.
  flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
  @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
  @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
  don't I always?
  Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks

"  waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
  too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
  thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE

"  she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!"
  what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
"  where is the ""award winning service""?"
  really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
  how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
  flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
  u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
  they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
"  unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you"
  your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
  just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful

  Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
  what's the delay if the system isn't down?
   Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
  don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
  That is not very gracious of   to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
  and ask she load the bag for my flight
"  after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
  get flight 16 into the air
  That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.

  she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight

"  question, flying for the 1st time with my 16mont old son...do I need to bring anything for him? Birth certificate/S.S. card etc?"
.  process begins 6:48
.  yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
.  yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.

  Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
  I will. I love flying with you all. Great service.

"  tough choices but I did all simultaneously! As a business traveler, best experience in a long time. #wishmyflightwaslonger #what"
  thanks!! Great service in #T5 already! #lovejetBlue
  I did...#FlyFi worked well and was free aboard this flight
  and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection
  already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
  Seems very likely.
  they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting

"  unfortunately no, but hoping I can catch one sometime in the near future!"
  why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
  @EllaHenderson Ah! Wish I was there! Good luck!
  should i continue?
"  Ok great thanks! I had a great flight, FYI. I'm excited to fly again. I just was frustrated I was not able to check in."
  I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
  Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect
  well lucky I only fly JB..I guess I would be even more squished on any other airline _Ÿ˜_

  @EllaHenderson omg!  Wish I had a flight today!  Haha there's always next time!  Have fun at #LFT5
  my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
  busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether
"  no, I am fine to fly! Haha, they come at random, with the hemophilia, but what if i need extra assistance"
  oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people

  I hear that the new thing in your planes are the Fly-Fi. How I can check if the flight that Im going to take have it?

  A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
  sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
  really caring??
  No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way.
  Thanks! Her flight leaves at 2 but she's arriving to the airport early. Wedding is in VT in Sept. Grateful you fly to BTV!! :)
