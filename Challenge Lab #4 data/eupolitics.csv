 flags and parading NI Haass talks end without agreement Haass: 'Trying to build the peace' Watch NI Haass talks: Political reaction The final draft of proposals given to Northern Ireland's political parties by Richard Haass has been published on the Northern Ireland Executive website. It came after months of talks on the issues of parades
 flags and the legacy of the Troubles ended without a deal. Earlier
 the UK and Irish governments called for the proposals to be made public. The seventh draft of the document was prepared by former US diplomat Richard Haass and Professor Meghan O'Sullivan. Northern Ireland's five main parties met through the night in a final effort to settle differences but were unable to reach an agreement on the document. Dr Haass
 who chaired the talks
 said that while a final agreement had not been reached
" ""significant progress"" had been made and there was a ""basis"" for change. New Year's Eve had been set as a deadline for agreement. 'Common ground' Prime Minister David Cameron said that politicians in Northern Ireland must continue their efforts to secure agreement on divisive issues. Mr Cameron said the talks had ""achieved much common ground"" nevertheless. Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the Irish government would work with Downing Street and Stormont to support further efforts to achieve greater peace. Meghan O'Sullivan and Richard Haass chaired a series of round-table talks The proposed deal won broad support from Sinn Féin"
 the largest nationalist party
" but others including the unionist DUP said unresolved issues over parades and flags meant more work was needed before consensus could be reached. Dr Haass said: ""We very much hope that the parties reflect on this"
" discuss it with their leadership and then come back with a strong endorsement. Over the next week we will know a lot more."" He said progress had been made in all three of the negotiating areas"
 especially the past
" while flags and symbols had proven to be the ""toughest area of negotiations"". Continue reading the main story Analysis Mark Devenport Political editor"
 Northern Ireland Although he is flying home without a deal
 Richard Haass believes his efforts haven't all been in vain. The former US diplomat reckons he has made significant progress
 especially on potential new institutions to deal with Northern Ireland's troubled past. Dr Haass hopes the Stormont parties can move these matters forward in the months ahead. That said
 the Stormont politicians don't have a great track record in resolving tough issues without outside assistance. So there's good reason for scepticism about their ability to deliver progress now Dr Haass and his talks co-chair Professor Meghan O'Sullivan have declared their involvement in these negotiations over. Dr Haass
 who was brought to Northern Ireland with co-chair Prof Meghan O'Sullivan in July by the first and deputy first ministers
" said all five parties had ""given it their best"" and were ""prepared to continue"" with the process. The US government also expressed their disappointment that the parties did not reach an agreement"
 Caitlin Hayden
" a spokesperson for the US National Security Council said: ""We commend the work of the independent chair and his team. ""Through months of consultations with civil society and the political parties -- undertaken at the request of the Northern Ireland Executive - Richard Haass and his team have done a remarkable job"
 she said. We believe that the draft text produced through the All-Party process represents real progress and makes a valuable contribution. We urge Northern Ireland's political leaders to continue to work together to build on this progress
" including implementing the proposals where consensus already exists and as it emerges in all three areas."" The final push for a deal began at 10:00 GMT on Sunday and carried on until 05:00 GMT"
 and was on a seventh set of draft proposals put forward during the talks. The three key issues have been: The past - more than 3
500 people died in the Troubles
 and in almost 3
300 cases no-one was prosecuted. Reaching agreement on how to investigate these killings and what to do about other people affected by the Troubles has so far proved impossible Flags - this issue was highlighted last year when Belfast City Council's decision to fly the union flag from city hall and other council buildings only on 18 designated days sparked street protests Parades - though many are not contentious
 some unionist parades that pass through or close to nationalist areas have been controversial. A small number of nationalist parades have also proved contentious in the past After the talks
" Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams said there would be ""a lot of disappointment"" that agreement had not been reached"
" but he believed the proposals contained the ""basis for a deal"". The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson said that while the ""broad architecture"" of the agreement was acceptable"
" ""some of the language and detail is not what we would have chosen"". SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said ""much has been achieved in terms of the past"""
 and despite some concerns
 he believed his party would endorse the proposals. Mike Nesbitt
 leader of the UUP
" said he would not disclose his opinion on the proposals until after his party had ""an honest debate"" about its contents. Alliance Party deputy leader Naomi Long said the talks had moved negotiations forward but there were still major challenges over the issues of parades and flags. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers expressed disappointment but said it was important that this was not ""the end of the road"". And Labour's Ivan Lewis"
 the shadow Northern Ireland secretary
" said: ""The failure to reach a final agreement is deeply disappointing. However"
" significant common ground has been identified which should be the basis for future progress."" What is your reaction to this news? Send your comments using the form below.

""The UK for now is not even the preferred destination for Romanians"
" said spokeswoman Brandusa Predescu. Some British newspapers have predicted migrants will make the journey to claim benefits and even steal scrap metal. Ministers have refused to predict how many migrants from Romania and Bulgaria might arrive. Both countries joined the EU in 2007 but since then, their citizens have been able to work in the UK only under certain conditions, which come to an end on Wednesday.

 with eight other EU countries - including France
 Germany and Spain - lifting restrictions at the same time
 ministers say forecasting numbers is difficult. Campaigners for tighter laws have said 50
000 Romanians and Bulgarians a year for the first five years could come to the UK. The Bulgarian ambassador has previously estimated that about 8
000 migrants a year from Bulgaria could come to the UK. Professor John Salt of the migration research unit at University College London said that data from Bulgaria shows that for the first three months of 2014
 the number of advance airline bookings is down on the same period last year. But he conceded there was a risk that services in the South East could be put under pressure if large numbers arrive. The leader of Westminster Council
 Philippa Roe
" echoed this concern and said Roma people had caused disruption in central London by aggressively begging and pickpocketing. The government is tightening the rules from 1 January to ensure that migrants cannot claim out-of-work benefits for three months after arriving and will only qualify for support after six months if they had a genuine chance of employment. Overseas visitors and migrants are also to face new charges for some NHS services in England.

 BBC News So
 will the new Act bring significant change? In many respects it is an exercise in codifying
 simplifying and giving statutory force to existing law. For instance
" courts had already started to dismiss ""libel tourism"" cases and jury trials had all but vanished in defamation cases. The power to achieve these things are now put into the Act. However"
 the Act will affect the balance between free speech and the right to protect reputation. For instance
 it will be more difficult for companies to sue for libel as they now have to show they have suffered or are likely to suffer serious harm because of a defamatory statement
" and they will only be able to do that if they can show they have suffered or are likely to suffer serious financial harm. That makes it tougher for them to go after journalists or scientists who write about their products and services. There is also more protection from libel for those running websites if they can show they are not the authors of defamatory posts and assist in identifying those who are. ""These laws coming into force represent the end of a long and hard-fought battle to ensure a fair balance is struck between the right to freedom of expression and people's ability to protect their reputation."" The Libel Reform Campaign"
 which is made up of Index on Censorship
 English PEN and Sense About Science
 has been demanding new legislation since 2009. Mike Harris
 of the campaign
" said it was ""good news for free speech"". ""The Defamation Act was intended by politicians to end the chill from the archaic libel laws of England and Wales"
 he said. It's taken four years
 support from 60
"000 people and a cross-party consensus to get to where we are today. ""We hope the judiciary will take note"
" and that in the future open debate on matters in the public interest will not be chilled by litigious oligarchs or corporations."" Tracey Brown"
 director of Sense About Science
" said the Act was a ""major step"". But she added: ""A lot will depend on how the courts apply the new law. We will keep it under review to see that the law does give scientists the increased confidence to publish that it promises."" 'Fit for 21st Century' The new Act applies only to England and Wales - Scotland has its own law and Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill has said he believes it is ""robust enough for present purposes"". The Stormont executive is currently considering whether to bring its libel laws inline with Westminster. Jo Glanville"
 director of English PEN
" said England and Wales now had laws ""fit for the 21st Century but the battle's not over yet"". ""It's essential that Northern Ireland now adopts the act. Otherwise the new law could be fatally undermined and cases could be heard in Belfast under the old legislation"
" she said. The main political parties committed themselves to reviewing libel law in England and Wales in their manifestos at the last general election.

" says Clegg Clegg: Tories moving EU goalposts Nick Clegg has used his new year's message to tell voters the Liberal Democrats are ""Britain's party of in"" when it comes to the European Union. The Lib Dem leader said other parties would put ""narrow political interest"" ahead of the UK economy. Mr Clegg said UKIP ""want out"" of the EU"
" the Conservatives were ""flirting with exit"" and Labour ""don't have the courage of their convictions on this"". He said the EU was not ""perfect"" but it ""means jobs"
" trade and prosperity"". Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017 - but Mr Clegg urged voters to send a message by backing the Liberal Democrat's in May's EU elections. ""Don't wait for a referendum"
" he said. Don't wait for the general election. Make your voice heard now. ""Once Britain finds itself with one foot out the door"
" we won't just be able to turn back. So don't take that risk."" Mr Clegg pointed to a Confederation of British Industry report published last month that suggested UK households were almost £3"
"000 a year better off thanks to Britain's EU membership. 'Not in love' The deputy prime minister said voters should not ""let anyone jeopardise our recovery"""
 and he criticised the Conservatives
" Labour and UKIP. ""All three would put narrow political interests ahead of the national economic interest"
 he said. So
 in a few months
" I'm going to ask you to make a different choice. ""The Liberal Democrats are Britain's party of in. Not because we're in love with the EU"
 or we think it's perfect
 but because being in Europe means jobs
" trade and prosperity"". Speaking about the coming year"
" Mr Clegg mocked the ""exciting breathless predictions"" made by other party leaders in the past. ""After a long period of drama and upheaval in the economy"
" how about a year of stability rather than surprises?"" he said. ""How about we make 2014 about one thing and one thing only: locking in our recovery."" Miliband makes cost of living vow 30 DECEMBER 2013 "

A government minister has joined calls for the UK to consider taking refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria. The government has no plans to accept Syrian refugees and says it is better to offer financial help. But Tory health minister Lord Howe said people were in desperate need and the EU should look at accommodating some. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said Britain was making a large financial contribution to helping Syrian refugees and could ""hold its head up high"". Lord Howe told BBC Radio's 5 live Breakfast: ""I think we have got to look at this urgently. There are people in desperate need"
" we cannot accommodate them all. ""I think the European Union has a duty to look at what it can do"
" both on the ground for those refugees from Syria but also whether we can accommodate some of them. ""I certainly think we should look at this and we have in the past been a country that looks kindly on people in distress and are the victims of violence in their native countries and that should not change."" Amnesty International has accused EU leaders of failing to provide a safe haven for Syrians UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage and former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell have made similar calls in recent days. On Sunday"
" Mr Farage suggested Western countries should agree to take an allocation of refugees but did not specify numbers. He has led opposition to allowing open immigration from Romania and Bulgaria in the new year but said refugees were a ""very different thing"". Last week"
" Sir Menzies said it would be ""entirely reasonable for the UK to take its share of responsibility for refugees"". Conservative MP Mark Pritchard said he expected the government would change its mind - either ""willingly or unwillingly"". Lord Howe became a health minister in 2011 In a report released earlier this month"
" Amnesty International accused European Union leaders of ""miserably failing"" to provide a safe haven to Syrians. Ten member states have offered to take in refugees"
 but only 12
000 of them
" it said. Mr Shapps said the government was not going to change its policy on accepting Syrian refugees. ""Britain's contribution to the humanitarian crisis [of £500m] is equal to all other 27 EU countries combined"
" he told BBC's World at One programme. He said the UK was putting in a massive amount of effort"" and suggested taking in 500 or 1"
"000 refugees would not solve the problem. ""This is a humanitarian crisis that involves millions of people. This country can hold its head up high"
" he added. Earlier, the UK government said more than 1,100 Syrian nationals had been granted asylum in the year up to September and asylum claims would be considered on their merits and in line with the immigration rules"". War and peace As Geneva peace talks loom"

 Ed Miliband has insisted in his new year message. The opposition leader said the issue of living standards would again be his focus in 2014
" accusing ministers of wanting to ""change the conversation"". While not ""promising the Earth"""
" he said Labour pledges on energy bills and childcare would help family budgets. The government said Labour's economic predictions had been proved wrong. Chancellor George Osborne has said signs of a strengthening economic recovery - with growth forecasts for 2013 and 2014 revised sharply upwards and unemployment steadily falling - show his plan is working.

 Mr Miliband said Labour's plan to freeze energy bills for 20 months from June 2015
" expand free childcare and crack down on payday lenders would ""tip the balance towards hope"" for many families struggling in the current climate. ""People do not want the Earth. They would prefer some very specific promises"

" the downside is that UK productivity has yet to improve and remains below its pre-recession level."" He said the low productivity was behind falling real wages and the high cost of living in the UK.

Rural ambulance times 'need rethink' A health minister says the death of a 26-year-old man in Norfolk highlights the issue of rural ambulance response times. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-25550338#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - Ambulance times 'need rethink' - minister Norman Lamb showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 30 December 2013 Last updated at 13:56 ET Ambulance times 'need rethink' - minister Norman Lamb Norman Lamb said some trusts focused on urban areas in order to meet response time targets Continue reading the main story Related Stories MP 'concerned' over ambulance trust Police fears at ambulance delays Ambulance delays in crash death A minister has called for a change in paramedic response targets in rural areas after a man collapsed and died. Norman Lamb
 MP for North Norfolk
 highlighted the case of Peter Nelson
 who waited nearly two hours for an ambulance and died in hospital from a haemorrhage. The 26-year-old collapsed at his home in Blakeney
 Norfolk
" on 14 November. Mr Lamb said response time targets should change as some trusts focused on urban areas in order to meet them. The health minister said he would raise the issue with NHS England. The East of England Ambulance Trust said: ""The ambulance service has written to Peter's family to confirm an investigation is under way and"
 until this is complete
" it would be inappropriate to discuss the matter further."" Mr Lamb said Mr Nelson's case was ""all too familiar"""
" adding: ""We need to rethink these targets because they distort behaviour. 'Rural areas neglected' ""I don't have a complete blueprint for the answer but I'm clear there is a massive risk that the current system is distorting clinical priorities and rural patients are suffering as a result."" He said he was due to meet Sir Bruce Keogh"
 who has carried out a review of emergency care
" in the coming weeks. He added: ""It seems that if they meet the target for the whole of the east of England"
" it satisfies the government target but the danger is they focus on urban areas where they can easily hit the target and rural areas get neglected. ""I'm sure this isn't limited to the east and you can't have a system that allows rural areas to lose out while trusts apparently meet Whitehall targets."" Mr Nelson had arrived home from work with a headache and collapsed later that evening. Emergency services were called at 23:15 GMT and a paramedic arrived within 15 minutes. The paramedic contacted the control room three times asking for the ambulance to arrive sooner"
 but it did not arrive until 01:00 GMT the next day

Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said the issue was ""too big to be left to politicians alone"". Alistair Darling"
 leader of Better Together
" called on everyone to vote so ""the decision we make is decisive"". On the 18 September 2014"
" voters will be asked the yes/no question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" Children's future Mr Darling reiterated his belief that ""we are all stronger when we come together"" and that ""the people of this island belong together in the United Kingdom"". ""First and foremost we should not divide Scotland"
 he said. One thing we all have in common
 yes
 no or undecided
" is that we love Scotland and want the best for our children's future. We are all looking forward to an exciting year where we will cheer on our sports stars here in Scotland. ""There are patriots on both sides of this debate and we should respect each other for that. ""Whatever decision we make this referendum year it needs be decisive. ""It is important that we are certain of where we will stand in the future. No one wants this debate on independence to drag on into another year. ""That means all of us in Scotland should resolve to vote in September and to make sure that the decision we make is decisive."" Diverse views Yes Scotland said the year ahead offered the chance to create a better future. Mr Jenkins also made a reference to 2014 being an important sporting year for Scotland"
 with the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. As well as these events
" he said the eyes of the world would be on Scotland as it made ""the single most important decision in more than 300 years"". Mr Jenkins went on to highlight the ""diversity of views"
 visions
" background and cultures"" of the Yes campaign. ""Among the many sectoral groups adding their weight to the Yes campaign are Polish for Yes"
 French for Yes
 Third Sector Yes and Yes LGBT
" he said. He added: Yes Scotland will ensure there is a sectoral group within the campaign for everyone. The debate on Scotland's future is too big to be left to politicians alone and we want everyone in the country to play their part in 2014."" Cost of living Meanwhile"
" Ed Miliband used his new year message to criticise the SNP over the ""cost of living crisis"""
" which he said could be solved with Scotland as part of the United Kingdom. The Labour leader said the SNP was not making a difference and had ""sided with the Tories when it comes to Labour's energy price freeze"". He said: ""But they are totally wrong"
 because the problem of higher energy bills is a problem in Southampton as well as in Stirling
 the problem of payday lenders is a problem in Gloucester as well as in Glasgow
" the problems of low pay is a problem in Essex as well as in Edinburgh. ""It goes across the United Kingdom"
" these are common problems. I think we can solve these problems with a common vision and a common future."" Social justice However"
" SNP leader at Westminster Angus Robertson said the UK had become ""more unequal"" under Westminster governments. ""A Yes vote is the route to social justice"
 and Mr Miliband may not know it
 but Labour have no credibility on cost of living issues in Scotland
 he said. A quarter of their own Scottish MPs didn't even bother to turn up at Westminster to vote to scrap the bedroom tax
" which we will in an independent Scotland."" Treasury claims post-Yes funding gap An independent Scotland would need to find an extra £1.6bn a year to pay for flagship policies such as free childcare"

 ministers say. They include extended prescription fees
 the introduction of charges for some emergency care and higher rates for optical and dental services. However
 GP and nurse consultations will remain free
 and nobody will be turned away in an emergency. Ministers say they are keen to clamp down on any abuse of the system
 but doctors' leaders have voiced concerns. The government had considered charging for GP consultations
 but decided that easy initial access was important to prevent risks to public health such as HIV
 TB and sexually transmitted infections. Other types of primary care services that are being considered for charging include minor surgery that is carried out by a GP and physiotherapy that has been referred through a GP. There are also plans to introduce a new system for identifying and recording patients who should be charged for NHS services. Specific details of how the plans will be implemented are due to be unveiled in March 2014. Continue reading the main story FREE NHS FOR WHOM? Free NHS care is offered to anyone living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so Asylum seekers
 non-European Economic Area nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK
 British expats
 and visitors usually have to pay for treatment The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries
 and under these visitors are given free NHS care The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but research suggests just £73m a year is recouped out of more than £460m at present. The government said the changes would allow the NHS to recoup money
" and encourage only those who need urgent and emergency care to attend. Health Minister Lord Howe said: ""Having a universal health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the world"
" but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking British taxpayers who fund it. ""We know that we need to make changes across the NHS to better identify and charge visitors and migrants. Introducing charging at primary care is the first step to achieving this. ""We are already looking at taking action and next year we will set out our detailed plans to clamp down on the abuse of our NHS."" A report by the King's Fund think tank has estimated that an average attendance at A&E costs the NHS approximately £111. 'Unintended drawbacks' The British Medical Association said it was concerned the proposals would require doctors and GPs to spend more time on paperwork and that it could cost more in administration charges than what it would recuperate. Dr Mark Porter"
 chairman of the BMA Council
" said: ""The government's current proposals could create unintended drawbacks for the NHS and patients. Media requires JavaScript to play. ""They are likely to create a complex patchwork of charging and access entitlements where some services remain free"
 such as GP appointments
 while others will be chargeable
 including A&E visits and other services provided via many GP practices
" such as physiotherapy."" Dr Chaand Nagpaul"
 who leads the BMA's GP committee
" added: ""We cannot have a situation where any patient with a serious health need is deterred from visiting a GP"
" especially if their condition raises a potential public health risk."" Labour shadow health minister Lord Hunt accused ministers of ""putting spin before substance"". ""Labour is in favour of improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment"
 he said. Rather than more grand-standing
 the government needs to deliver practical
" thought-through changes to make that happen. ""Instead this out-of-touch government is left asking doctors and nurses to act as surrogate immigration officials."" The announcement follows a Department of Health study which estimated that up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors' and migrants' use of the NHS every year through better charging. However"
 it estimated that only approximately £8m would come from charges for using A&E. However
 academics have argued that the extent of deliberate health tourism - where people travel to the UK specifically to use the NHS - has been hugely overstated and is responsible for only a small part of NHS expenditure. The government has already announced a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area staying for between six months and five years. A cost-recovery unit will help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. NHS 'can save £500m' on foreign care 22 OCTOBER 2013 
 HEALTH This entry is now closed for comments Jump to comments pagination 30th December 2013 - 17:13 No wonder there are long waiting times ! I believe in helping others but surely if people can afford the flights over here they would be able to pay for treatment wherever they are. Obviously we have one of the best health services in the world but where do these people get health numbers from to get treated for free ? 30th December 2013 - 17:11 Measure which do not go far enough unfortunately. Pay or have insurance to pay........ end of........ same as it is for UK citizens going abroad for whatever reason who find themselves requiring medical help. 30th December 2013 - 11:23 I can understand where people are coming from when they talk about helping people
 healthcare is undoubtedly a right we should all be entitled too.... however
 This is reality and the NHS only has finite resources and manpower to which the British taxpayer pays for. This move should have been implemented ages ago. The UK needs to stop trying to provide for everyone in the world! 30th December 2013 - 11:17 These proposed measures don't go far enough. The NHS is free at the point of use
 but it isn't free. It is funded with taxpayer money and it is an incredibly expensive system. Emergency care should be free to all. For the good of the public
 services related to infectious diseases should be free to all. Visitors to the UK and non-tax paying immigrants should pay full cost for all other services. 30th December 2013 - 9:02 We are all human so we all deserve a level of care
 that's pure & simple & It would be barbaric of any society to turn down some level of medical treatment
 especially in an emergency. My only concern is that people begin to abuse the system to their own ends & let's face it
 this will happen in a diverse society. I personally like the fact that the UK provides this service to others in need. with your BBC iD

Bush Continue reading the main story Related Stories Iraq Inquiry hold-up over documents Peers call for Iraq report 'urgency' Iraq war report delayed to 2013 Progress is said to have been made in talks over the declassification of vital papers relating to the UK's involvement in the Iraq war. The Chilcot Inquiry said last month it could not proceed further since key material
 including notes between the then PM Tony Blair and US President George W Bush
 had yet to be released. But discussions since then have been more productive
 the BBC understands. The inquiry could now publish its report before the end of 2014. The inquiry
 chaired by Sir John Chilcot and which began in 2009
 had hoped to have begun contacting those likely to be criticised in its report to allow them to respond - an important stepping stone to its final publication. But this process has been held up pending discussions over the release of classified documents which the inquiry wishes to include in its report. These include 200 cabinet-level discussions in the run-up to the 2003 invasion
 25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush
 and more than 130 records of conversations between Mr Blair or Gordon Brown and Mr Bush. 'Difficult material' Last month
" Sir John wrote to Prime Minister David Cameron expressing his regret that no agreement had yet been reached over the publication of the most ""difficult documents"". He said the next phase of its work was ""dependent on the satisfactory completion of discussions"" between the inquiry and the government on disclosure of material that the inquiry wishes to include in its report or publish alongside it. The final decision over which documents can be released is being taken by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood"
" Mr Cameron's most senior adviser. The BBC understands ""greater progress"" has been made in the past six weeks"
" and Whitehall sources have confirmed they want the inquiry to be able to publish its report before the general election in May 2015. 'Legal issues' But Whitehall sources cautioned against suggestions in some newspapers that the documents would be made public within three months. There were still outstanding ""legal and diplomatic"" issues to be resolved before a publication date could be announced"
 and in any case some material was likely to be redacted. In a statement
" the Cabinet Office said the process was continuing: ""The government is currently engaged in discussions with the inquiry which the inquiry recognises raises difficult issues"
" including legal and international relations issues... ""These issues are being worked through in good faith and with a view to reaching a position as rapidly as possible."" The inquiry"
 which is examining the background to the UK's involvement in the 2003 invasion and its aftermath
 has never set a firm deadline for publishing its final report - set to be about a million words long. However
 it is thought likely to want to publish by the end of 2014 or early 2015 at the latest
 to avoid any conflict with the general election campaign. Iraq Inquiry hold-up over documents 06 NOVEMBER 2013

UK 'cannot extend' migrant controls The UK has done all it can ""within the law"" to delay the lifting of work restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants"
 a senior Conservative says. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25549712#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - UK 'cannot extend' migrant controls
 says Grant Shapps showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 30 December 2013 Last updated at 11:48 ET UK 'cannot extend' migrant controls
" says Grant Shapps Border controls have been extended to the maximum period of seven years Continue reading the main story Migrants to face NHS care charges Bulgaria warns UK over curbs The UK has done all it can ""within the law"" to delay the lifting of work restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian migrants"
" a top Conservative has said. Party chairman Grant Shapps said the deadline for ending temporary controls had already been extended by two years and this could not be done again. Tory activists say there is scope within EU law to retain controls until 2018 under exceptional circumstances. And the UK Independence Party has said the UK's position is ""total madness"". Bulgarians and Romanians gained the right to visa-free travel to the UK in 2007"
 when their countries joined the EU. But since then
 they have been able to work in the UK only if they are self-employed
 have a job offer
 or are filling specialist posts for which no British worker can be found. These temporary restrictions come to an end on Wednesday
" which has prompted warnings from Conservative activists of a ""hugely disruptive and destabilising wave of mass immigration"". Ninety party members have written to David Cameron pressing him to use a clause in EU law - allowing countries to continue with border controls if they have ""serious labour market disturbances"" - to extend restrictions until 2018. This comes on top of more than 60 MPs signing an amendment to the current immigration bill going through Parliament calling for a further five-year extension. Mr Shapps said he had sympathy with those worried about the economic and social impact of future migration from Bulgaria and Romania"
" on top of that seen since Poland and nine other countries joined the EU in 2004. But he said the ""maximum"" seven-year limit for transitional controls on migrants after their countries join the EU could not be extended under current arrangements. ""We are doing everything we can within the current law"
" he told Radio 4's World at One programme. You can only act within the law. that is the basic principle of democracy."" Only by renegotiating the UK's membership of the EU"
 he suggested
 could new rules be put in place in future to limit freedom of movement among citizens of existing and new EU members. David Cameron has said the idea of freedom of movement within the EU
 one of its most important principles
" needs to be reconsidered as ""massive"" population shifts in the past decade have put pressure on countries across Europe. Mr Shapps said: ""Of course"
" this is why we want an EU in-out referendum so we can negotiate these things so these transitional controls can last longer in future. ""So for example"
 if you've got countries joining the EU in future where the standard of living is so incredibly different
" then you are able to have much longer transitional controls or you don't allow people to travel until their countries and economies have come up to a certain level."" 'Perplexing' The government is tightening the rules from 1 January to ensure that migrants cannot claim out-of-work benefits for three months after arriving and will only qualify for support after six months if they had a genuine chance of employment. Overseas visitors and migrants are also to face new charges for some NHS services in England. But in a letter"
 written by Conservative Grassroots chairman Robert Woollard

" with local authorities and public services unable to cope. They say a ""safeguard clause"" written into the EU treaties ""allows for the re-imposition of temporary restrictive measures in any member state if it is 'undergoing or foresees serious labour market disturbances'. Extending the controls to 2018 would allow the UK economy the space and time to reverse the long-term high youth unemployment trend"
 they add. Ministers have refused to predict how many migrants might arrive from Romania and Bulgaria. With eight other EU countries - including France
 Germany and Spain - lifting restrictions at the same time
 they say such forecasts are difficult. Romanian and Bulgarian officials have suggested they believe about 8
000 migrants will come every year for five years but campaigners for tighter laws have said the figure could be as high as 50

Hague urges South Sudan ceasefire Foreign Secretary William Hague speaks to leaders of both sides in the conflict in South Sudan and urges them to commit to an immediate ceasefire. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25543833#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - William Hague urges South Sudan rivals to halt violence showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 29 December 2013 Last updated at 14:10 ET William Hague urges South Sudan rivals to halt violence South Sudan's government says its troops are still fighting in oilfields in the country's north Continue reading the main story The UK foreign secretary has spoken to the leaders of both sides in the conflict in South Sudan and urged them to commit to an immediate ceasefire. William Hague urged South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar to halt the violence that has killed at least 1
"000 people. There could be no ""military solution to this conflict"
" Mr Hague said. His intervention is part of a wider international effort to foster a negotiated end to the fighting. Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote A worsening conflict that causes South Sudan to slip back would be a tragedy” End Quote William Hague Foreign Secretary As well as the 1,000 people killed, more than 121,600 people are believed to have fled their homes in the country in recent weeks. Tens of thousands of civilians have sought refuge in UN camps. Mr Hague said a ceasefire was vital to prevent the deaths of more innocent civilians"" and to enable international humanitarian aid to reach people ""in desperate need"". He urged Mr Kiir and Mr Machar to ""enter into negotiations immediately and without preconditions"" and offered UK diplomatic support to any talks. 'Coup plot' The instability in the country"
 which gained independence in 2011
 began in July when Mr Kiir sacked Mr Machar as his deputy. In December
 rival armed factions turned on each other and Mr Kiir accused Mr Machar of trying to unseat him in a coup. What began as a power struggle between the two men has taken on overtones of a tribal conflict. The Dinka
 to which Mr Kiir belongs
 are pitted against the Nuer
 from which Mr Machar hails. Last week US Secretary of State John Kerry urged both sides to enter into mediation. East African leaders on Friday agreed to attempt to bring Mr Kiir and Mr Machar to the negotiating table by 31 December. The government has offered a ceasefire
 but Mr Machar says any ceasefire has to be credible
 properly monitored and preceded by the release of 11 detainees accused of being co-conspirators in the coup plan. The army says its forces are still battling over oilfields in the north. Mr Hague attended South Sudan's independence celebrations in 2011
 after it ended decades of civil war by breaking away from its northern neighbour Sudan. There
" he said: ""I... witnessed the hope and optimism felt by its people after years of conflict and sacrifice. Their safety and their future must be put first. ""A worsening conflict that causes South Sudan to slip back would be a tragedy."" Sudan's arid north is mainly home to Arabic-speaking Muslims. But in South Sudan there is no dominant culture. The Dinkas and the Nuers are the largest of more than 200 ethnic groups"
 each with its own languages and traditional beliefs
 alongside Christianity and Islam. Both Sudan and the South are reliant on oil revenue
 which accounts for 98% of South Sudan's budget. They have fiercely disagreed over how to divide the oil wealth of the former united state - at one time production was shutdown for more than a year. Some 75% of the oil lies in the South but all the pipelines run north The two Sudans are very different geographically. The great divide is visible even from space
 as this Nasa satellite image shows. The northern states are a blanket of desert
 broken only by the fertile Nile corridor. South Sudan is covered by green swathes of grassland
 swamps and tropical forest. After gaining independence in 2011
 South Sudan is the world's newest country - and one of its poorest. Figures from 2010 show some 69% of households now have access to clean water - up from 48% in 2006. However
 just 2% of households have water on the premises. Just 29% of children attend primary school in South Sudan - however this is also an improvement on the 16% recorded in 2006. About 32% of primary-age boys attend
 while just 25% of girls do. Overall
 64% of children who begin primary school reach the last grade. Almost 28% of children under the age of five in South Sudan are moderately or severely underweight - this compares with the 33% recorded in 2006. Unity state has the highest proportion of children suffering malnourishment (46%)
 while Central Equatoria has the lowest (17%).

 flags and parading Haass: 'Trying to build the peace' Watch NI Haass talks: Political reaction Flags process proposed in NI talks Months of talks to resolve some of the most divisive issues that have hampered the Northern Ireland peace process have broken up without agreement. Northern Ireland's five main parties met through the night in a final effort to settle differences over parades
 flags and the legacy of the Troubles. Former US diplomat Dr Richard Haass
 who chaired the talks
" said a final agreement was ""not there"" but there had been ""significant progress"". He called it a ""basis"" for change. 'Strong endorsement' The BBC's Andy Martin in Belfast said that although a positive spin had been emphasised by all those involved in the talks"
" the current proposals would need significant modification to be collectively adopted by all five main parties. ""This process is not dead"
 but it is far from finished
" he said. Meghan O'Sullivan and Richard Haass chaired a series of round-table talks The proposed deal won broad support from Sinn Féin, the largest nationalist party, but others including the unionist DUP, said unresolved issues over parades and flags meant more work was needed before consensus could be reached. Dr Haass said: All the parties support significant parts of the agreement. At the same time"
" all have some concerns."" Continue reading the main story Analysis Mark Devenport Political editor"
 Northern Ireland Although he is flying home without a deal
 Richard Haass believes his efforts haven't all been in vain. The former US diplomat reckons he has made significant progress
 especially on potential new institutions to deal with Northern Ireland's troubled past. Dr Haass hopes the Stormont parties can move these matters forward in the months ahead. That said
" the Stormont politicians don't have a great track record in resolving tough issues without outside assistance. So there's good reason for scepticism about their ability to deliver progress now Dr Haass and his talks co-chair Professor Meghan O'Sullivan have declared their involvement in these negotiations over. ""We very much hope that the parties reflect on this"
" discuss it with their leadership and then come back with a strong endorsement. Over the next week we will know a lot more."" He said progress had been made in all three of the negotiating areas"
 especially the past
" while flags and symbols had proven to be the ""toughest area of negotiations"". Dr Haass"
 who was brought to Northern Ireland with co-chair Prof Meghan O'Sullivan in July by the first and deputy first ministers
" said all five parties had ""given it their best"" and were ""prepared to continue"" with the process. ""It would have been nice to have come out here tonight and say we have got all five parties completely signed on to the text"
" he said. We are not there but I believe there is a real prospect that we will get several of the parties to sign on the text in full. ""Several of the other parties will endorse significant parts of it"
" and together this will provide a basis for a serious ongoing political process."" 'Disappointment' The overnight negotiations"
 which began at 10:00 GMT on Sunday and carried on until 05:00 GMT
 were on a seventh set of draft proposals put forward during the talks. The three key issues have been: The past - more than 3
500 people died in the Troubles
 and in almost 3
300 cases no-one was prosecuted. Reaching agreement on how to investigate these killings and what to do about other people affected by the Troubles has so far proved impossible Flags - this issue was highlighted last year when Belfast City Council's decision to fly the union flag from city hall and other council buildings only on 18 designated days sparked street protests Parades - though many are not contentious
 some unionist parades that pass through or close to nationalist areas have been controversial. A small number of nationalist parades have also proved contentious in the past After the talks
" Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams said his negotiating team believed there was a ""basis for a deal in the proposals put forward"". He said the team would recommend it to the party's executive"
" though he said the proposed deal was ""not perfect"". ""I'm sure there will be a lot of disappointment out there as people come to terms with the fact that there doesn't appear at this point to be an agreement"
" he said. Flags are seen as important expressions of cultural identity in Northern Ireland The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson said that while the broad architecture"" of the agreement was acceptable"
" ""some of the language and detail is not what we would have chosen and in some cases we strongly disapprove of the language"". ""We entered into this process to get the right deal for the people of Northern Ireland"
 but not any deal
 he added. We do not have an agreement this evening but we are committed to continuing this work beyond now in dialogue with others to try and resolve the outstanding issues that need to be addressed
 he said. We owe that to the people of Northern Ireland
" especially to the innocent victims of terrorism who have suffered so much over the decades."" Alliance Party deputy leader Naomi Long said the talks had moved negotiations forward but there were still major challenges over the issues of parades and flags. ""We have seen a huge sea change in the level of political agreement which has exceeded public expectation"
 particularly in delivering for the victims and the reconciliation process
 Mrs Long added. 'Honest debate' SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell said despite some concerns he anticipated his party would accept the agreement. He said: We would anticipate a general endorsement from the SDLP in due course
" that's not to say we're entirely happy... but we do welcome it as far as it goes."" Mike Nesbitt"
 leader of the UUP
" said he had an opinion on the document but was unwilling to disclose it until his party had examined the proposals.

 he said. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers expressed disappointment but said the failure to reach agreement did not spell an end to negotiations. I welcome the suggestion by Dr Haass that the parties should now lose no time in getting together to see how they can most constructively take things forward
 she said. For our part
" the UK government will look at how we can best facilitate this."" And Labour's Ivan Lewis"

 try again. Since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement the folks on the Stormont hill have made several attempts to keep devolution on the political tracks. Trains have always been used as an analogy for Northern Ireland's long drawn-out political process. In 1997
" Tony Blair warned Sinn Féin that the ""settlement train"" was leaving and would not wait. Former DUP leader Ian Paisley"
 now Lord Bannside
" told his party members in 2005 that the ""democracy train"" was leaving"
 with or without them. There have been delays
 faulty signalling and many long halts leading to the restoration of devolution in May 2007. The Assembly was suspended in February 2000 over the IRA's failure to decommission its weapons
 and the issue of arms led to further suspensions of devolution up until October 2002
 when allegations of an IRA spy-ring at Stormont again led to direct rule being imposed for a further four years. D'Hondt's rules Nascent power-sharing has been criticised for being heavy on debate and light on law-making
 even by some of those Assembly members sitting on the chamber's blue benches. The Assembly can legislate on all matters transferred to it from Westminster
 which includes everything except defence
 foreign policy
 and raising taxes. The executive
 in effect the government of Northern Ireland
 is made up of Assembly members using a mechanism created by a 19th Century Belgian lawyer
 Victor D'Hondt for sharing out ministries between parties. Like a box of Belgian chocolates
 the largest parties get to choose the tastiest portfolios. The executive is headed by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister
 which
 incumbents of the deputy first minister's post have been keen to point out
 is a joint office
" with both ministers receiving equal standing and equal powers. Both ministers have also been keen to be questioned less by the Assembly - every four weeks instead of fortnightly - but that move was derailed. The devolution process has been a bumpy ride - from Tony Blair's ""hand of history"""
 to the refusal of DUP politicians to shake hands with their Sinn Féin partners in government. Former SDLP Deputy Leader Seamus Mallon once famously described the Good Friday Agreement's power-sharing deal as the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement for slow learners. BBC Democracy Live will allow you to decide if the Assembly train is whizzing by
 or the slow coaches are being delayed by the wrong type of political leaves on the line. The Assembly is Northern Ireland's Parliamentary debating chamber There are 108 Members of the Legislative Assembly

 Wednesday
 28 October 2009 E-mail this to a friend Guide to the Scottish Parliament Media requires JavaScript to play. A tour of the Scottish Parliament The campaign for devolution in Scotland culminated in 1999
 with the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. In the three centuries since the Treaty of Union
 discontent - to put it mildly - was expressed at being governed from London. The Scotland Act of 1998 paved the way for the creation of a Scottish Parliament capable of passing laws affecting Scotland on a range of issues
 known as devolved matters. The powers given to the Parliament include the ability to raise or lower the basic rate of income tax by up to three pence in the pound - an option unused so far by Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Distinct The Scottish Parliament scrutinises and monitors the devolved Scottish Government and makes laws for Scotland. Although government ministers are drawn from the Parliament
 the two institutions are legally separate and have their own distinct roles. The Scottish Parliament's devolved powers are not supreme and ultimately are only granted at the discretion of the Westminster Parliament. Some areas remain the preserve of the UK Parliament - and Scotland remains part of the UK. Nevertheless
 decisions over vital areas like health
 education and housing are now made in Scotland. Devolution was intended to bring a new politics to Scotland. By relocating decision-making closer to the people of Scotland
 the aim was to increase access to the democratic process and as a result
 raise the accountability of those elected to the Parliament. Has devolution succeeded? That remains a matter of opinion - and the subject of fierce debate. Even the Parliament building at Holyrood has proved controversial . It cost more than £400m and was delivered three years late. One of the Parliament's exterior walls bears 24 carved inscriptions 
" including one from Sir Walter Scott's Heart of Midlothian. It reads: ""When we had a king"
 and a chancellor
 and parliament-men o' our ain

"000 Jones's four years as first minister Political leaders in Wales are looking to positive economic signs at the start of 2014. But First Minister Carwyn Jones acknowledged times were still tough for many in the country. Meanwhile Welsh Secretary David Jones said the UK government had to hold its nerve as it rose to the challenges ahead. Both men pointed to record numbers in work in 2013 in their New Year messages. Welsh Labour leader Carwyn Jones said: ""We are open and honest about the challenges we face but our commitment will not falter."" He said 2013 had seen some positive signs that Wales was ""recovering well from one of the longest economic downturns in living memory"".

""There has also been a big fall in the number of young people out of work - with our flagship Jobs Growth Wales programme helping to create thousands of opportunities for the workforce of the future"
 he said. Mr Jones also said there had been a massive increase in foreign investment in Wales. But he admitted that life continued to be tough for many people. Spirally living costs

'Rise to the challenge' Mr Jones went on: ""I know that some of these decisions will have affected you personally or professionally. ""But only by holding our nerve have we been able to rise to the challenge and become the fastest growing economy in the Western world.""

 31 May 2011 15:54 UK E-mail this to a friend Guide to the National Assembly for Wales Media requires JavaScript to play. On 18 September 1997
 the people of Wales voted in a referendum on devolution. They may have voted yes
 but it was by the thinnest of margins - 50.3% to 49.7%. Nevertheless
 a new dawn had broken
 as the then-Welsh Secretary Ron Davies claimed. Although wheels were set in motion for a National Assembly for Wales
 those in favour had a huge task to convince those who had voted against it - and those who hadn't voted at all - that it would benefit the country. With that challenge in mind
" Mr Davies famously said that ""devolution is a process"
" not an event."" Laws from scratch That proved to be the case. The Government of Wales Act 1998 established the Assembly but it wasn't until a second act in 2006 that it gained the ability to make its own laws from scratch rather than adapting legislation created in Westminster. However"
 the Assembly still had to ask MPs for permission to legislate in some areas
 which led to bickering between Cardiff Bay and Westminster over the finer details of certain requests for the power to legislate. Two areas that saw a tug-of-war along the M4 were the Welsh language and affordable housing. The beginning of the fourth Assembly in May 2011 heralded a new legislative system in Wales. In a referendum on 3 March 2011
" voters in Wales decided that the Assembly have the power to pass laws on devolved issues without first having to ask Westminster. The Assembly prides itself on avoiding the ""yah-boo"" politics of Westminster. And although chamber sessions do get heated from time to time"
 the shouting and jeering associated with the House of Commons is kept to a minimum. The Senedd 
 sited in the area formally known as Tiger Bay
 plays home to the 60 AMs. There are 60 Assembly Members
 made up of 40 constituent AMs and 20 regional AMs Plenary sessions are held twice a week on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons Since the 2011 Assembly election
 Labour has half the available seats The Senedd houses the debating chamber and committee rooms There are 12 subject committees
 on issues such as Enterprise and Learning
 and Sustainability The Senedd was officially opened by the Queen on St David's Day in 2006 There are five legislative committees that scrutinise new Bills The Senedd building was designed by the architect Lord Richard Rogers E-mail this to a friend More from BBC Democracy Live Compare who does what across the UK and Europe Our A-Z of words used in the business of politics Discover what BBC Democracy Live has to offer you You're using the Internet Explorer 6 browser to view the BBC website.

Appeal to help tidal surge victims Waveney MP Peter Aldous calls on the government to help coastal communities affected by the recent tidal surge which flooded properties in his constituency. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-25453847#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - Government urged to help victims of the tidal surge showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 20 December 2013 Last updated at 04:12 ET Article written by Deborah McGurran Political editor
 East of England Government urged to help victims of the tidal surge The Light Dragoons were called in to help protect homes from flooding Nearly two weeks after the tidal surge devastated parts of his constituency
 Peter Aldous has urged the government to guarantee the clean up costs. All along the east coast people suffered as the rising sea flooded homes
 shops and pubs. Many lost their possessions
" others their businesses and few will be able to return for many months. The Waveney MP told parliament that the region had escaped ""by the skin of its teeth"" when the storm surge hit. ""In 2007 the wind dropped in the nick of time"
 whilst two weeks ago we were fortunate in that the wind was blowing in a northerly direction and there was no heavy rainfall
 which would have exacerbated the surge in the rivers. It would be foolish to assume we would be lucky again
" he said. Narrowly averted crisis Mr Aldous said coastal communities remain anxious about the future after the tidal surge of 5 December. It was described as the strongest ever recorded. He told the House of Commons there was a strong sense in places like Lowestoft that parliament had not properly considered what was a narrowly averted national crisis. He said: The challenges of rising sea levels and climate change mean that such events will take place with greater frequency."" Two weeks ago we were fortunate in that the wind was blowing in a northerly direction and there was no heavy rainfall” End Quote Peter Aldous MP (Con) Waveney Mr Aldous also questioned the government's flood defence policies and strategies. ""There is a concern that they were not devised with coastal flooding in mind"
" he said. In a written statement earlier this month Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the government would be discussing with every local authority area affected by the flooding what further help they need to ensure places can quickly get back on their feet"". But Mr Aldous called for an update. Defra minister"
 Dan Rogerson
" replied: ""It's a testament to their efforts that the impact"
 while devastating to those directly affected as we've heard
" is on a much lesser scale than the comparable coastal flooding event in 1953. ""However"
" there are always lessons to be learned from our response to an event such as this and I can assure the House that the government will review our approach and improve our planning and preparedness accordingly."" Mr Aldous noted: ""This House is about to go into recess and whilst I will be wishing you and all colleagues a happy and restful Christmas"
 we must not forget that there are many people
 not only in Lowestoft but all along the east coast
" who will not be so fortunate as ourselves."" A salutary note on which to end the year. Article written by Deborah McGurran Deborah McGurran Political editor"

Duncan defends foreign aid budget International Development minister Alan Duncan rejects calls to cut Britain's foreign aid budget. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25424258#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - International aid gives UK respect

 East Midlands International aid gives UK respect
 says Alan Duncan Many Syrian refugees in Lebanon live without running water or sanitation It's that time of year to reflect
 consider others and to look forward. Many of the memorable images that stick in the mind from 2013 - all too sadly - are from disasters
 either man-made or natural. The Syrian civil war
 the snow-covered refugee camps and the typhoon in the Philippines have dominated the headlines. It's a reminder that bad news travels faster. But the good news here is the generosity of ordinary British people. Even when money is tight
 people are prepared to dig deep into their pockets. The generosity of ordinary people is great” End Quote Alan Duncan MP Minister
 Department for International Development It's a theme that was picked up by Alan Duncan
 a minister in the Department for International Development (DFID). And after three and a half years in the job
" the minister knows which government levers to pull when Britain needs to respond. ""This is an amazing country when faced with a humanitarian disaster"
 no matter where in the world. The generosity of ordinary people is great
 he told me. More than £100m raised through public appeals and British government aid is now helping the Philippines with its repair work. 'Should be proud' Which is why we
 as a government department
 try to match whatever is raised by the public
" Mr Duncan added. The British people should be immensely proud of how they've responded."" A depot in Dubai holds huge British stocks of emergency tents and blankets. They're ready to be despatched in an instant to the latest disaster zone. ""We are preparing for the risk of an earthquake in Nepal or Kathmandu. That's very likely"
 added Mr Duncan. We know that over the next few years there will be cyclones in India and floods in Bangladesh. You can prepare by storing the right type of buildings that don't automatically get washed away. Alan Duncan MP visited a DFID-funded maternity hospital in Biratnagar
 Nepal
" on a fact-finding trip ""And you can train people"
" so they know how to respond."" Alan Duncan is the Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton"
 one of the more comfortable and affluent areas of the East Midlands. He rejects calls from some in his party
 both locally and nationally
 for budget cuts in international aid. 'Right thing to do' His department's budget in the new financial year will top £10.3bn
 and will rise to £11.1bn the following year. Alan Duncan says that'll help the UK reach an important UN target for richer countries
" by giving 0.7% of its annual spending to international development. ""OK"
 there's austerity at home and our international development budget has gone up. But it's been and continues to be the right thing to do
" he added. It's a more dangerous world. Just look at Syria and Egypt. There are more natural disasters. ""But if you were to cut the budget down to zero"
" it would not be big enough to solve all the other problems people say the UK has got. ""It's only about 1% of total government spending. That's not a huge amount. And yes"
 our international development gives us enormous respect around the world
" he told me. Compassion fatigue? There's no sign of it when the Disasters' Emergency Committee makes its latest appeal. And there's no sign of fatigue from the ever energetic Alan Duncan.

" or words spoken in our video coverage Economy dominates last PMQs of the year Media requires JavaScript to play. 18 December 2013 Last updated at 12:49 David Cameron has welcomed the ""encouraging"" fall in unemployment and called for an apology for Labour for its predictions of poor economic performance. The UK unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since 2009"
 as the number of people out of work fell by 99
000 to 2.39 million in the three months to October. However
 Mr Cameron warned against complacency
" telling MPs during the last prime minister's questions of 2013 that ""there is still work to do to get our country back to work"". Labour leader Ed Miliband welcomed the latest employment figures"
 during the exchanges on 18 December 2013
" but he said the PM had no answer to the ""cost of living crisis"". Mr Miliband said more people are working part-time because they cannot get the hours they need"
 and told the Commons that wages were falling while household bills on energy and childcare rose. The prime minister responded by telling MPs that 70% of the new jobs created since the 2010 general election are full-time jobs. He said he wanted to see more money in people's pockets and that the only way to do that is to stick with the government's economic plan. But Mr Miliband attacked the coalition government's record
 which he said had failed to meet its fiscal targets
" and told Mr Cameron he had failed at being prime minister. The prime minister replied: ""What you can't stand is this Christmas"
 the economy is growing
 1.2 million more people are in work
 our exports are increasing
 manufacturing is up
 construction is doing better
" the economy is getting stronger and Labour is getting weaker."" ""It is time he apologised for his prediction of talking the economy down"

Q&A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21013771#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - Q&A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 23 January 2013 Last updated at 06:17 ET David Cameron speech: UK and the EU By Alex Hunt Politics editor, BBC News website Media requires JavaScript to play. In full: Prime Minister David Cameron's speech on Europe David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech ( full text ) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to bring back"" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now"
 the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election
 by the end of 2017. That
 obviously
 also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said
 here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech
" but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be ""brought back"" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive"
" which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: ""We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights"
" criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK."" Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration"
 so
 as part of negotiations
 there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community
" in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: ""Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No"
 of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is
" what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market."" What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner"
" party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement.

 here's a full list of who is doing what job. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19475248#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - Cabinet reshuffle: David Cameron's new line-up showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 7 October 2013 Last updated at 10:55 ET Cabinet reshuffle: David Cameron's new line-up Here is a guide to the cabinet reshuffle
 October 2013: All Lib Dems New to cabinet Women Oxbridge education Under 50 Prime Minister David Cameron Conservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39. The Old Etonian had dazzled that year's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma
" reportedly telling journalists he was the ""heir to Blair"". He has sought to match the former PM by putting the Conservatives at the centre ground of British politics. After the 2010 election he led his party into coalition with the Lib Dems"
 making tackling the UK economy's deficit its priority. He has faced criticism from some on the right of the party but Mr Cameron has insisted the coalition will see through its full five-year term. Before becoming leader
 he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary. He was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton. Nick Clegg Deputy Prime Minister Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg In just five years
 Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg
 a contemporary of Mr Cameron
 went from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics. After becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election
 he was promoted to Europe spokesman
 before moving on to the home affairs role. When Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007
 he entered the race to succeed him
 in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne. He really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general election
 being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one. However
 this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party
 though
 retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament. After taking his party into coalition with the Conservatives - and U-turning on a previous pledge to reject university tuition fees - Mr Clegg saw his personal poll ratings slump
 but he has pointed to areas where Lib Dem policies have come into force on taxation and consitutional issues. Like David Cameron
 he has insisted the coalition is working in the national interest and will continue for the full parliament. Chancellor George Osborne One of David Cameron's closest friends and Conservative allies
 George Osborne rose rapidly after becoming MP for Tatton in 2001. Michael Howard promoted him from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury to shadow chancellor in May 2005
 at the age of 34. Mr Osborne took a key role in the election campaign and even before Mr Cameron became leader the two were being likened to Labour's Blair/Brown duo. The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor
 but have avoided the spats. Some prominent Conservatives have urged Mr Osborne to do more to promote economic growth. Before entering Parliament
 he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague. Home Secretary Theresa May Theresa May is the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary. She was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman
" under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. She then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron. She has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the ""A list"" of preferred candidates. A passionate moderniser"
" she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the ""nasty party"". In her role as home secretary"
 she has overseen widespread changes to the immigration system. Mrs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election. Foreign Secretary William Hague Since he returned to frontline politics in 2005
 Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron
 and was seen as de facto deputy party leader. The foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon
 having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election. A witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members
 Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales. In addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary
 Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England
 as chairman of its Northern Board. Business Secretary Vince Cable Vince Cable has had a long journey to reach the front rank of politics
 having been a Labour and then an SDP supporter before its merger with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats. An economist by profession
 he entered Parliament as MP for Twickenham in 1997 and has gradually built up his powerbase among the Lib Dems. As the party's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman he saw his stock rising during the credit crunch because of his earlier warnings. When he stood in as temporary leader after the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell
" he memorably described Gordon Brown as going from ""Stalin to Mr Bean"". Has had a colourful time in government"
 notably when he was recorded by under cover reporters saying he was at war with Rupert Murdoch's News International. He has been mentioned as a possible future leader of his party. Sir George Young Chief Whip Chief Whip Sir George Young Sir George Young was replaced as leader of the Commons by Andrew Lansley in the September 2012 reshuffle
 but was recalled and given the Chief Whip post a few weeks later following the resignation of Andrew Mitchell. Sir George
 71 at the time of his return to the cabinet
 is one of the most experienced members of the government and has served a number of roles in Conservative administrations since the 1970s. He was elected as MP for Acton in 1974 and became a junior minister in the Thatcher government in 1979. In 1994 he became Financial Secretary to the Treasury
 and was promoted a year later to transport secretary. Switching seats to North West Hampshire in 1997
 he was given the shadow Commons leader's job in the Tory opposition the same year. From 2001-09 he served as chairman of the Standards and Priveleges committee
" which required him to ajudicate allegations of MPs misconduct. Sir George was educated at Christ Church Oxford and is married with two sons and two daughters. He is a keen cyclist and received the nickname ""the bicycling baronet"" after appearing in a British Rail advert promoting the transport of bikes on trains. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles Eric Pickles was first elected to the Commons in 1992"
 representing an Essex seat far from his Yorkshire roots. He has extensive local government experience
 having led Bradford District Council for three years up to 1991. He has also served in a variety of shadow ministerial roles
 including transport
 local government and social security spokesman
 earning a reputation for loyalty and good humour. He boosted his reputation and profile in the party by masterminding its landmark victory over Labour in the Crewe and Nantwich by-election and was appointed party chairman in 2009. And he became a regular and confident media performer in the months leading up to the 2010 general election. Conservative Chairman Grant Shapps Mr Shapps
 the MP for Welwyn Hatfield
 in Hertfordshire
 since 2001
 has made a name for himself as a keen and frequent media performer. In his twenties he started a printing company. In 2005
 Mr Shapps became a deputy chairman of the Conservative Party
 experience which will be useful in his new job as chairman. Until the reshuffle
 he served as housing minister
 a role without full cabinet status but one which allowed him to attend meetings. Culture Secretary Maria Miller Ms Miller has been MP for Basingstoke since 2005
 during which time she has impressed the Conservative leadership with her presentational skills. Previously a spokesman on education and family issues
 she was made minister for disabled people when the coalition took power in 2010. Before entering politics
 Ms Miller
 a mother-of-three who grew up in Wales
" worked in advertising. Her role as Culture Secretary includes overseeing the ""legacy"" of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond Philip Hammond has built up a reputation as an articulate and effective Commons performer since being elected MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997. A former director of companies supplying medical equipment"
 he was initially a member of the Conservative shadow health team before going on to serve as trade and industry spokesman. He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid. In summer 2002
 he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury
 at the age of 51
 in the July 2007 reshuffle. He became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election
 building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011. Education Secretary Michael Gove Tory Michael Gove was seen as one of the brightest talents in the 2005 intake. The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches. As the Tories' housing spokesman
 Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs. He was drafted into the shadow cabinet as children
 schools and families spokesman
 at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes. Mr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath. He had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead
 but he stuck with the education brief in government bringing forward a series of radical changes such as free schools and exam reforms. Ed Davey Energy and Climate Secretary Energy and Climate Secretary Ed Davey Liberal Democrat Ed Davey was appointed Energy and Climate Change Secretary on 3 February 2012 following the resignation of Chris Huhne. Mr Davey was elected MP for the newly created seat of Kingston in 1997 and has held a series of frontbench roles. Popular within the party
 he was seen as an outside contender to succeed Sir Menzies Campbell when he stood down in 2007. After serving as the Liberal Democrat spokesman for foreign affairs prior to the 2010 election
 he was appointed business minister responsible for the Post Office
 Royal Mail and employment relations in the coalition government. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson Conservative MP Owen Paterson covered the Northern Ireland portfolio in opposition and in government before being moved to environment in David Cameron's reshuffle. He entered the shadow cabinet for the first time
 at the age of 50
 in David Cameron's July 2007 reshuffle. A former managing director of the British Leather company
 he entered Parliament as MP for Shropshire North in 1997
 concentrating on rural issues as a junior agriculture spokesman and chairman of the Conservative Rural Action Group. A Eurosceptic and member of the right wing Cornerstone Group
 which campaigns for traditional Tory values
 he helped Iain Duncan Smith during his 2001 leadership bid and was briefly parliamentary private secretary to Ann Widdecombe. He has also served in the Opposition whips office. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt was moved to the health brief after the overseeing the smooth running of the 2012 London Olympics. The MP for South West Surrey since 2005
 he became the Conservatives' culture spokesman in 2007. He was previously the party's spokesman on disabilities and welfare reform. Mr Hunt
 a fluent Japanese speaker
 founded a company called Hotcourses
 offering guides to help students find the right course before entering university. As culture secretary he had a chequered time
 coming under pressure over his dealings with Rupert Murdoch's News International takeover bid. Justine Greening Int. Development Secretary Int. Development Secretary Justine Greening Justine Greening was promoted to the cabinet in October 2011 at the age of 42. Miss Greening
 the MP for Putney since 2005
 became economic secretary to the Treasury after the 2010 election
 succeeding Philip Hammond as transport secretary after he was promoted to defence secretary. Born and educated in Yorkshire
 Miss Greening studied economics at Southampton University
 before getting an MBA from London Business School and worked as a finance manager at British Gas owner Centrica before joining the Commons. Her move from transport was widely perceived to be a result of her vocal opposition to the idea of a third runway being built at Heathrow. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling Chris Grayling's elevation to the post of Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary represented something of a comeback. Prior to the 2010 general election he had been shadow home secretary but
 when the coalition was formed
 he was made employment minister
 rather than given a cabinet role. Seen as being on the right of the party
 Mr Grayling's appointment to the justice role will be intended to reassure some Conservatives who were unhappy at predecessor Ken Clarke's prison reforms
 claiming they were too lenient on criminals. Educated at Cambridge University
 he is a former BBC News producer and the author of books on subjects including the Bridgewater Canal and Anglo-American relations. Theresa Villiers Northern Ireland Secretary Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers A former barrister

 she was made a shadow transport minister
 a brief she continued to hold when the coalition came to power. A self-described Eurosceptic
 she takes over from Owen Paterson in the post of Northern Ireland Secretary. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael Mr Carmichael has been appointed Scottish Secretary in the government's latest reshuffle. He replaces Michael Moore - a leading figure in the No campaign for the Scottish independence referendum. Mr Carmichael
 the MP for Orkney and Shetland
 has been the Lib Dems' chief whip and a government deputy chief whip since the formation of the coalition. He was previously the party's Scottish spokesman. Born in 1965
 Mr Carmichael had a traditional upbringing on a hill farm on the Inner Hebrides island of Islay. He developed an early interest in politics
 joining the Liberal Democrat party at just 14. He went on to work as a hotel manager before studying law at Aberdeen University. He then became a procurator fiscal depute
 working mostly in the criminal courts. He was elected to the UK parliament in 2001
 replacing Jim Wallace as MP for Orkney and Shetland. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander Danny Alexander was Nick Clegg's chief of staff and the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator throughout the election. He was also the former media chief of pro-euro campaign group Britain in Europe
 which brought together leading Labour and Lib Dem voices with business groups. First elected to Parliament in 2005
 he rose to prominence when Mr Clegg became party leader in 2007. He was the author of the party's 2010 election manifesto
 becoming the Scottish Secretary in David Cameron's initial coalition cabinet. Mr Alexander was promoted to chief secretary - a crucial role overseeing spending cuts - to succeed David Laws after was forced to quit over his expenses after less than three weeks in the job. He is one of four key ministers
" known as ""the Quad"""
 who meet to discuss the direction of much of the coalition's policy. The Inverness
 Nairn
 Badenoch and Strathspey MP won one of 11 seats for the Lib Dems in Scotland. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin Patrick McLoughlin was the Tory chief whip while the party was in opposition and carried on after the 2010 general election as the government chief whip. The former miner is the MP for Derbyshire Dales. When the Conservatives were previously in power
 he was a minister at the departments of transport
 employment
 trade and industry
 and in the whips' office. In opposition
 he became deputy chief whip in 1998. Mr McLoughlin's mother was a factory worker and he worked as a farm labourer before following his father and grandfather into the pits. His move to transport in the reshuffle has raised speculation the government is planning to alter its current stance opposing a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Welsh Secretary David Jones Elected MP for Clwyd West in 2005
 Mr Jones was a middle-ranking minister in the Wales Office before being promoted to the cabinet. He replaces Cheryl Gillan. Several Welsh Conservatives have expressed their delight that an MP with a Welsh constituency is now in the top job within the department. Ms Gillan's constituency is in England. A Welsh speaker
 Mr Jones served as a member of the Welsh Assembly before going to Westminster. He is a fan of Liverpool Football Club and a keen user of the social networking website Twitter. He is also chairman of the Chinese Conservative Group. Iain Duncan Smith Work & Pensions Secretary Work & Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith
 the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green
 is steering through a range of welfare changes in the role he has held since the 2010 election. A former army officer
 who saw active service in Northern Ireland
 Mr Duncan Smith entered Parliament in 1992 and rapidly established himself as one of the Maastricht rebels that made life so difficult for then Tory leader John Major. He was seen as a rising star of the Eurosceptic right and
 after a spell as shadow defence secretary under William Hague
 was the surprise victor in the September 2001 leadership contest
 beating better-known and more experienced
 Europhile candidate Ken Clarke. He had a torrid time as the Tory leader
 failing to land many real blows on then PM Tony Blair and enduring a relentless barrage of criticism from the press and
 in some cases
 his own MPs. In November 2002
" he urged his party to ""unite or die"" in response to persistent whisperings of a challenge to his leadership"
 but a year later he was ousted after narrowly failing to win the backing of enough MPs in a vote of confidence. After losing the Tory leadership
 he has successfully reinvented himself as a social reform champion who
 with his centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice
" has played an influential role in developing Conservative policy on welfare and the ""broken society"". David Cameron reportedly tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to move to become Justice Secretary in his September 2012 reshuffle"
" but Mr Duncan Smith opted to stay with the welfare brief. Ken Clarke Minister without Portfolio Minister without Portfolio Ken Clarke Mr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke is a ""big figure"" with ""great experience"". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s. His return to the Tory front bench in 2009 was seen as of a gamble for Mr Cameron"
 given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views. These views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits. Mr Clarke was president of the Union at Cambridge
 became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health
" education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997. He served as Justice Secretary from May 2010 until the move to a ""roving role"" as a ""wise head"" based in the cabinet office. Lord Hill Leader of the Lords Leader of the Lords Lord Hill Lord (Jonathan) Hill of Oareford became leader of the Lords at the age of 52 in January 2013 when Lord Strathclyde resigned. Although this is his first Cabinet post"
 he has wide experience
 having been at the Conservative Research Department and then special advisor to Ken Clarke at Transport in the 1980s before becoming John Major's political secretary in No 10 from 1992. He has also worked for public relations firm Bell Pottinger and in 1998 he became a founding director of PR and lobbying firm Quiller Consultants
 where he remained until 2010 when he was made an education minister in the new coalition government. Andrew Lansley Leader of the Commons Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley Andrew Lansley
 a former civil servant
 became an active Conservative in the 1980s after a spell as private secretary to Norman Tebbit. In 1990 he became head of the Conservative Research Department and was one of the architects of the Tories' surprise 1992 election victory. However
 he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign. He returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary
 the brief he continued to hold under David Cameron. Mr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him. During his two years as health secretary
 he steered through a large package of reforms of the NHS in England
 despite facing opposition on a number of fronts. Attorney General Dominic Grieve A Conservative activist from an early age - and the son of a former Tory MP - Dominic Grieve was elected to the Commons in 1997 as the MP for Beaconsfield in South Buckinghamshire. He is a barrister and was the shadow attorney general for four and a half years until June 2008
 when he was appointed shadow home secretary. He filled the vacancy created when David Davis quit as an MP to fight a by-election on civil liberties and plans for a 42-day terror detention limit. Mr Grieve is an ex-member of the London Diocesan Synod with an interest in constitutional issues and an opposition to devolution - he is a past shadow Scottish affairs spokesman. Regarded as a skilled and assiduous Commons performer
 he was the Tories' shadow justice secretary ahead of the election. The attorney general is not a full cabinet position under David Cameron.

" with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his ""Red Ed"" tag by talking about the ""squeezed middle"" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on ""refounding"" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge"
 but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005
 he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament
 he enjoyed a rapid rise
 becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children
 Justine Thornton in 2011. ED BALLS - SHADOW CHANCELLOR As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser
 he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005
 he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary
 despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However
 following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011
 Mr Balls
 at the age of 44 
 became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. YVETTE COOPER - SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITIES Popular throughout the party
 the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent
 she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later
 at the age of 30
 she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder
 working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it
 saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor
 she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up
 but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. DOUGLAS ALEXANDER - SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter
 he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43 
 he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest
 chairing his campaign. TRISTRAM HUNT - SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY Historian Tristram Hunt

 he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. ANDY BURNHAM - SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY Turning 40 in 2010
 Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest
 in which he came fourth. During the campaign
 he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party
 he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP
 serving as chief secretary to the Treasury
 culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love
 health in 2011. HARRIET HARMAN - DEPUTY LEADER AND SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY Labour's deputy leader

 including solicitor general

 at the age of 56 . A longstanding campaigner for women's rights

What will happen in 2014? Mark D'Arcy gazes into his crystal ball http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25449695#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - Happy New Year? showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 31 December 2013 Last updated at 09:44 ET Article written by Mark D'Arcy Parliamentary correspondent Will UKIP smash the established parties in May's euro elections? Will Scotland vote to leave the UK in September? Two game-changing tests of public opinion loom ominously over the coming year's parliamentary agenda
 and their outcomes will resonate through much of the activity in Westminster. Legislation will be needed if Scotland goes independent - and if it does not
 the expectation is that some new devolutionary deal will have to be offered
 and that a devolutionary domino effect may then require new offers to Wales
 Northern Ireland
 and
 who knows
 maybe England too. What would be the status of Scottish MPs if their country is in the UK's departure lounge? Could the 2015 general election be held on schedule
 or would the life of the current Parliament have to be extended until the flag of an independent Scotland was hoisted? And would the government suddenly be a majority Conservative administration
 with no need of the Lib Dems to give it a majority in the remaining UK… Or in the other case
 would the government have to launch some quasi-federalist rejig of the UK constitution? So
 one way or another
 the next few months will provide plenty for the constitutionalists to chew on. In the early part of the year
 it will be a case of waiting for UKIP. Conventional Westminster wisdom suggests that holding the Euro-elections a few months after the lifting of the transitional immigration restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian nationals will have toxic consequences for the Coalition parties - and maybe for Labour
 too. So much of what goes on in Parliament in the run-up to that vote will be aimed at providing an antidote. Hence the proposals for benefit restrictions on immigrants introduced to fanfares and hosannas
" as a statutory instrument just before the Christmas break. Expect the government to keep up a steady stream of initiatives on this theme. And that's before we get to the Immigration Bill (see below). And expect Conservative backbenchers to go further. A number of Tory elders are extremely concerned that their leadership has left the party with an anodyne ""offer"" to voters in the Euro-elections"
 and they want to put something tougher on the table. So I anticipate some serious efforts to get Bill Cash's proposals for the UK Parliament to assert its sovereignty over EU law debated in the chamber. Last May
 the same group pushed their leaders (not the government
 crucially
 because the Lib Dems wouldn't come on board) into backing the private members bill for an EU referendum
 after the Speaker allowed them to put down an amendment in the Queen's Speech debate. That might be a little late to influence the Euro-vote
 next May
 but another serious show of backbench strength on some vote-able motion could once again prod David Cameron into taking a more robust position. Meanwhile backbencher James Wharton's EU Referendum Bill will be launched into the House of Lords
 under the care of the avuncular Lord Dobbs
 with a second reading debate on January 10th. Their Lordships almost never reject a bill at that stage
 but I expect that opponents will bog it down with amendments and keep the detailed committee and report stage debates running
 until there's no time for the Commons to consider any amendments to the Bill… a form of legislative humane killing. Will that outcome be seen as the work of dastardly Europhile plotters or as a sign that the Conservatives can't deliver a referendum? And will the Conservatives then seek to keep the cause alive
 by bringing in an identical private members bill in the new parliamentary session which begins in May? That could leave them in a position to invoke the Parliament Act to over-ride opposition in the Lords
 just in the run-up to the next election. There will doubtless be other attempts Tory to reach out to potential UKIP voters. There's talk of a move to loosen restrictions on hunting with hounds
 via a statutory instrument from Owen Patterson's Defra
 to bring English hunting laws (which normally limit the number of hounds that can be used to flush out a fox to just two) into line with those in Scotland (which allow more hounds). That would show a little leg to the Countryside Alliance
 and to voters who had hoped for a repeal of the hunting ban
 had a Conservative government been elected in 2010. Then there's prisoner voting. The slightly bizarre sight of Nick Gibb
 the ex-minister who chaired the special select committee set up to find a way out of Britain's imbroglio with the European court of Human Rights
 signing up to a minority report
 when a majority of his committee supported a compromise
 suggests that this issue is far from solved and could set up another clash between the UK and a European institution (always remembering that the ECHR is not an EU body). One of the interesting sub-plots here is the close watch Labour are keeping on the UKIP phenomenon. Some Labour MPs fret that the row over immigration from Eastern Europe will not abate after the EU elections and that it will stir up voters in their heartlands
 overturning the accepted view that UKIP is primarily a drain on the Conservative vote. Almost everyone in Westminster takes a near Marxist view that ultimately economics will drive politics. Conservative confidence has recovered in step with the growth statistics - but Ed Miliband's success in changing the subject to cost of living issues has added a twist to the debate. At the last PMQs of the year
 his charge that David Cameron was spouting statistics which ignored the squeeze on people's incomes was noted by Tory strategists - who are determined to ensure their leader is not seen as a desiccated calculating machine who doesn't understand real people's lives. At the same time Labour will be seeking ways to keep the cost of living issue in the spotlight. There was an attempt to open a second front over water charges
 which will doubtless continue as the Commons processes the Water Bill. But many Labour MPs believe they need a more convincing line on the economy - especially after shadow chancellor Ed Balls' chastening experience responding to the Autumn Statement. There has been briefing suggesting he could be replaced if he fails to make more impact. The last Labour occupant of the Treasury
 Alistair Darling
 is tipped as the once and future Chancellor - but he's busy leading the 'No' campaign in Scotland and won't be available till after the vote
 in September (and maybe not then
 if he's on the losing side). Might that be too late? If Mr Darling returned
 he would not have much time to change the narrative. But there are not many other obvious contenders
 although if Mr Miliband wanted to think outside the box
 the Public Accounts Committee Chair
 Margaret Hodge has proved herself a formidable operator
 and she would bring a campaigning record on tax avoidance and a deep knowledge of where government wastes money to the job. And an Osborne-Hodge double-act at Treasury questions would provide a fascinating parliamentary battle. What about the Lib Dems? They don't get much oxygen in the Commons
 now their leader has no guaranteed slot at Prime Ministers Questions. Nick Clegg's monthly DPM Question Time is a kind of four minute hate
 in which Labour MPs snarl and Tory backbenchers growl. In fact his main outlet is now his LBC radio show. The party strategy is clearly to circle the wagons and concentrate on trying to hold their current seats and maybe sneak through in a couple of targets
 and be there as a pivotal force in the next Parliament. Next time
 they murmur
 they might opt to sustain a minority government from one of the other parties in return for policy concessions rather than entering a second coalition. But first they have to reach that happy position. In the Euro-elections the key Lib Dem performance indicator will be their vote in the South-Western region. If they can't keep an MEP in their ancient political heartland
 expect shockwaves to run through the party. I've blogged before that it seemed for a long while that if they need to sacrifice their leader
 their only real play was to give the job to Vince Cable - but that the new Scottish Secretary
 Alistair Carmichael
 might now provide an alternative if he performs well in the independence referendum. And while all these undercurrents are running
 expect Lib Dem MPs to devote a lot of time to constituency work and even to rebel on constituency issues. In fact
 this could be a pretty general trend. One view of the next election is that it will be fought as 650 by-elections
 with the fate of MPs determined less by the great sweep of national politics and more by local issues. A&E closures
 cuts to the armed forces
 by-passes
 HS2
 fracking
 local immigration issues
 new housing developments
 airport expansion (check out Zac Goldsmith's outspoken opposition to a third runway at Heathrow) and the like could all be decisive in different areas - and many of these matters will come up in legislation. UKIP may be the focus of a populist rebellion against the established parties
 but it may not be the only standard to which voters can rally. Dr Richard Taylor
 who held the Wyre Forest seat for two terms on a ticket to save the local hospital could prove to be the forerunner of a new breed of local campaigner; and Martin Bell who took true blue Tatton from the Tories could be an example for others to follow. And few MPs nursing narrow majorities will dare to say in advance that they plan to accept an above-inflation pay increase
 should that option still be on the table
 come election time. All of this will colour MPs approach to the remaining legislation of this Parliament. In truth the Coalition front-loaded its programme to the first two years of this Parliament with the conscious aim of not having too much controversial business to transact as the next election approached... So what's left? The Anti-social Behaviour
 Crime and Policing Bill has now cleared the Commons
 but will be tested in 4 days of Report Stage debate in the Lords from January 8th. The Committee stage debates foreshadowed attempts to tweak or change controversial aspects of the bill on firearms licensing
 dog control notices
 new powers to deal with anti-social behaviour
 giving shop workers greater protection from abuse and extradition arrangements. In particular
 Labour have criticised the provision to abolish the ASBO and replace it with the IPNA (Injunctions to Prevent Nuisance and Annoyance) - currently
 breaching the conditions of an ASBO is a criminal offence but this would not be the case with IPNAs. Then there's the 
 which has cleared the Lords
 and starts its Commons Committee Stage on January 9th. One hot issue is the powers for special administrators in dealing with NHS trusts that are considered to have failed (part of Clause 118
" being dubbed the ""hospital closure clause""). This was set to happen in Lewisham but ultimately didn't"
 after huge opposition. The provision
 supported by Health Minister Earl Howe
" would permit the government to make cuts to one hospital even if it is a neighbouring hospital which is failing. Another issue worth flagging is the ""deferred payments scheme"" - this scheme would stop anyone having to sell their property while they are still alive to pay for care in either a residential or their own home. In the Lords this attracted opposition led by Lord Lipsey"
 a former member of the royal commission on long-term care of the elderly
" for not being a ""universal"" scheme. Which leads to the central problem"
 the amount of extra money needed to make the social care system really breathe... Labour accuses the government of a failure of ambition; the government retort that Labour (or at least the shadow health secretary Andy Burnham) are stuck with an old-fashioned inflexible and statist vision of the care system... cunningly
 they don't level the same charge at the shadow care minister Liz Kendall. The other strand in all this is the personal needle between Andy Burnham and the Health Secretary
 Jeremy Hunt
 whose Commons exchanges have become increasingly bitter. I don't expect them to clash during the committee stage of this bill
 but perhaps later on... The continues its Report Stage in the Lords on January 7th. So far Peers have clashed over provisions for fostering and looked-after children - one measure removes explicit duties to consider a child's religious persuasion
 racial origin and cultural and linguistic background when placing them for adoption. There has also been straight opposition from Labour on the bill's provisions for children with special educational needs (SEN)
 which have been billed as the biggest reforms to SEN provision in 30 years. Peers still have time to press for changes. In the Commons some MPs tried but failed to reverse controversial changes to staff to child ratios in childminder settings; it remains to be seen whether Peers will be more successful. Baronesses Pitkeathley and Lister have put forward and amendment to be discussed in the new year on the responsibilities of local authorities for carers of disabled - they want a duty to promote the carer's well-being. The government has a torrid time over the and no further dates for consideration have yet been scheduled. The is now at the ping pong stage - bouncing between the Commons and Lords until they can agree on its final form. The bill is expected to go back to the Commons for considerations of Lords amendments
 but there is rumour that the government will add yet another provision last-minute. Like Godot
 the is expected but never seems to arrive. And lurking in wait when its report stage is scheduled is Tory backbencher Nigel Mills' amendment calling for the loosening of border controls to Romanian and Bulgarian workers
 which is currently due to take place on 1 January 2014
 to be postponed until December 2018. The government clearly hope to bat away a rebellion
 but on an issue that involves both the EU and immigration (see above) their rank and file may prove hard to control. The has been through the Lords
 and MPs await its report stage in the Commons. Labour opposed the bill at second reading
 arguing that the proposed changes to the probation service would be unworkable and threaten public safety. Expect more clashes when they come to grapple with the detail. The has cleared the Commons
 and has four more committee stage days in the Lords during January. One controversial aspect
 discussed but not amended in the Commons is the provision to stop the married person's allowance based on their spouses' history of National Insurance contributions. This loophole is said allow 220
000 pensioners living abroad to claim on their spouse's record. This issue could well be picked up by Peers. The really intense Lords action could well be over the Transparency of Lobbying
 Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill - aka the Gagging Bill - which has cleared the Commons
 and is due for four more committee stage days in the Lords in January. This is the preliminary sparring over the detail
 with the serious clashes to follow at report stage... Following the 'pausing' of part two of the bill
 the particularly controversial bit about non-party campaigning during elections
 the government promised to continue their consultation during the committee stage. Baroness Hayter
 shadow Cabinet Office minister
" says that ""this amounts to Peers being turned into one large focus group for policy-making."" So we can expect an onslaught of amendments at report stage - making changes to registering consultant lobbyists"
 the defining characteristics of being a consultant lobbyist
 the definition of non-party campaigning and third parties as well as setting maximum campaign expenditure limits. This strikes me as the kind of measure that could run into real trouble in the Lords
 not least because many peers have senior roles in the kind of organisations that fear they may be fettered by these proposals. In earlier sessions of this Parliament
 peers have filleted a couple of government bills - and this may be the next one to get the treatment. Article written by Mark D'Arcy Mark D'Arcy Parliamentary correspondent 11:45 UK time

How did the Lib Dems do in 2013? Eighteen months away from the general election and leading in the polls
 but many Labour supporters will be concerned that it will not be enough to achieve victory. Ever since the coalition came to power
 Labour has attacked the speed and scope of the government's deficit reduction programme which
 the opposition claimed
" had hindered growth and led to ""three wasted and damaging years of flatlining"". The return of economic growth in 2013"
 particularly in the final few months of the year
 presented a significant problem for Labour and a need to shift its political strategy. That process began in February when the Labour leader Ed Miliband pressed David Cameron at Prime Minister's questions on the issue of living standards
" claiming that prices had been rising faster than wages since the government had taken office. Energy pledge But it was not until September's Labour Party conference that Ed Miliband struck a chord with the public when he announced that his party would freeze gas and electricity bills for every home and business in the UK for 20 months if it won the 2015 election. The Conservatives denounced the policy as a ""price con"" but the former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says Mr Miliband's announcement marked a change in Labour's fortunes. Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote The first two thirds were ok but not brilliant and then we had Ed Miliband's speech to party conference which changed the political weather” End Quote Jack Straw Labour MP ""It's been a year of three thirds"
" he reflects. The first two thirds were ok but not brilliant and then we had Ed Miliband's speech to party conference which changed the political weather"". The party ends 2013 still leading in the opinion polls"
 but the leadership will be astutely conscious of the need to press home its cost of living argument
" particularly as the economy gathers momentum. Pollster Deborah Mattinson believes Labour should be worried. ""No party has come from the levels that Labour is polling right now to go on to win an overall majority"
" she says. If I was advising Labour I'd be saying you ought to be doing much better than you are now to be comfortable"". As the general election draws closer"
 Labour will also need to answer the big questions about its plans to get the deficit down and the implications for the party's tax and spend policy. All the while pressure is mounting on the party's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls who
 according to Labour insiders
 has nine months to prove he is up to the job following his performance during the Autumn Statement
 in which which he struggled to make himself heard and his resultant blushing led to #RedEd trending on Twitter. Union row A major distraction for Ed Miliband over the summer was the debacle over the selection of a general election candidate in Falkirk. The accusation of vote-rigging by the Unite union was a major test to his authority as leader and led to the resignation of the party's campaign co-ordinator Tom Watson. Ed Miliband was forced to act by announcing changes to the political levy that affiliated unions pass on to Labour. But the matter remains far from closed. The GMB union is about to withhold £1m from the party and other unions are considering their next moves too. Labour insiders suggest Ed Balls has work to do prove himself Much will depend on the outcome of a review being conducted by the former general secretary
" Ray Collins - now Lord Collins. But Diane Abbott - sacked as a frontbencher in the autumn - says the leadership has mishandled the issue. ""It's not been good for him (Ed Miliband) but frankly I don't think we've handled it very well. We've gone out on a limb where we could lose all our union funding."" The disagreements were not only consigned to the unions as Ed Miliband took exception to an article in the Daily Mail over the reputation of his father"
" the Marxist academic Ralph Miliband. Mr. Miliband accused the newspaper - whose article was headlined ""The man who hated Britain"" - of lying and in doing so won plaudits from across the political spectrum. Desert Island This was also the year that Ed Miliband appeared on Desert Island Discs and Deborah Mattinson believes that"
 in general
 the Labour leader's image among the public is improving
" albeit from a relatively low base. But senior figures believe the party still has work to do. ""It's got to get itself in an effective position over the economy and over what will be a recovery in the country's economic fortunes"
" Jack Straw argues. It needs to clarify what it's doing on health and what Labour has to offer as opposed to what the Conservatives are offering"". If Labour is to achieve an outright majority"
 its biggest challenge will be to persuade the voters that it has learned the lessons of its 13 years in government and neutralise the coalition claim that Labour was to blame for the depth and length of the worst recession in living memory. How did the Conservatives do in 2013? 30 DECEMBER 2013

A shrinking economy in the final three months of 2012 meant that the Conservatives faced the prospect of a triple dip recession at the start of the year. Not only was that avoided but growth has steadily gained momentum
 culmunating in December's Autumn Statement where the chancellor was able to announce that the official GDP forecasts for 2013 had more than doubled. The former Conservative Party leader Michael Howard
 now Lord Howard
" acknowledges that there are still challenges ahead on the economy. ""On the whole it's been a good year"
 he says. I don't want to underestimate the difficulties that still face us. We've seen the deficit coming down
" we've seen economic recovery gathering pace and we're making a good deal of progress"". 'Jury out' But despite the improving picture"
 there has been disquiet that the party has allowed Labour to steal a march on the cost of living debate
" particularly on energy bills.

" he says. [But] has it actually trickled down to our constituents' pockets and I think the jury is still out on that one. Are we all sharing in this growth?"" Maintaining growth and delivering the deficit reduction plan will no doubt be the Tories' main preoccupation of 2014"
 but David Cameron still has problems with discipline within the parliamentary party. A free vote on gay marriage saw 136 Conservative MPs oppose the legislation and David Cameron also saw his authority severely damaged when thirty of his own backbenchers ignored the whip and deprived him of the mandate to take an active part in operations in Syria. 'On the defensive' For Tim Loughton such issues are a source of frustration
" which he blames on the Conservative leadership: The Conservatives were divided over same-sex marriage ""We don't need some of these self-bowled ""googlies"" like Syria and gay marriage"
" which turn us on the defensive and we're arguing amongst ourselves"". Europe remains a deeply divisive issue and the prime minister has tried to quell the Eurosceptic arm of the party by offering an 'in/out' referendum on Britain's EU membership"
 to be held by the end of 2017. But even if it bought him a bit of peace and quiet within the party it seemingly failed to neutralise the threat from the UK Independence party (UKIP) as the Tories slumped to third place in the Eastleigh by-election. Triggered by the resignation of the Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne
 the Conservatives were hoping to convert their tougher talk on EU migration into votes by regaining the Hampshire seat they had lost in a 1994 by-election. UKIP threat Instead
 UKIP recorded their best ever Westminster election performance and brought humiliation to the Conservative candidate

" it was UKIP that were making all the running. That is not a flash in the pan."" The scale of the UKIP threat will be tested in May's European elections. Many Conservatives are assuming they will trail behind Nigel Farage's party. How the Conservatives respond to the threat and woo back disillusioned voters will be a key challenge for next year.

" most of these issues will likely pale into insignificance as 2013 will be remembered for the death of Margaret Thatcher. She may have deeply divided public opinion but despite her death many in the Conservative Party believe her legacy lives on. ""She transformed the country and I think we're still benefiting enormously from the reforms that her government put in place"
" says Lord Howard.

Why the Liberal Democrats got tougher in 2013 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25510983#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - End-of-year review: The Liberal Democrats showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 27 December 2013 Last updated at 04:20 ET End-of-year review: The Liberal Democrats By Tom Edgington BBC Radio 4 political producer In the first of a series of end-of-year reviews, we look back at a turbulent 12 months for Nick Clegg and his party. On the face of it, 2013 would seemingly be a year to forget for the Liberal Democrats. The party was engulfed by allegations of sexual harassment made against former chief executive Lord Rennard - although no charges were ever brought - and the imprisonment of former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne. Former leader Lord Ashdown accepts the episodes have taken their toll. But he said: It's how you deal with these things that matter"
" not that they occur in all parties from time to time."" However"
 despite the difficulties
 Nick Clegg's party looks back on a number of successes. 'Stunning victory' Three weeks after Mr Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce were jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice over the swapping of speeding points
 the Eastleigh by-election was held. Chris Huhne faced the media after his release from prison To the surprise of many observers
" the Lib Dems were able to hold on to the Hampshire seat despite struggling at times to achieve double digits in national opinion polls. Mr Clegg hailed a ""stunning victory"" which had been secured ""against the odds"". Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote These were not flesh wounds; these were cutting into bone” The party put its electoral success"
 in part
 down to the strength and organisation of grassroots activists
" a view shared by the pollster and former Gordon Brown adviser Deborah Mattinson. ""There's some truth in their claim that they have a lot of local loyalty. They are tending to do better when there's a Lib Dem incumbent"
" she told BBC Radio 4. But local successes mask a deeper problem which has plagued the Lib Dems since they went into coalition, added Ms Mattinson. Namely, what does the party stand for? When you view the party as a whole"
" people are quite contemptuous of them. They don't really get what they're for and what they've done to make things any different to just under a Conservative government."" 'Big hits' That analysis might help explain why Mr Clegg has become more vocal about listing the achievements of the Liberal Democrats in coalition. Victorious by-election candidate Mike Thornton"
 with wife Peta
 gave the party some hope There are also signs that the gloves might be coming off as intra-coalition rows
 such as over free school meals and the EU immigration cap
 have been waged in public. Another former leader
 Charles Kennedy
 welcomed this strategy
" arguing that the party must not return to the way things were in the first two years of the parliament. ""We took some big hits in the first half"
" he said. We lost the Alternative Vote referendum and we had to do a 180-degree turn on tuition fees. ""These were not flesh wounds; these were cutting into bone. It's only in this calendar year that we've seen a slight correction of the equilibrium"". 'Easy living' If the party is to present a distinctive agenda to the public and differentiate itself from the Conservatives"
 then 2014 may be the year of increasing coalition friction. But
 despite the recent robustness from the leadership
" the Lib Dems have stalled in national opinion polls. Former leader Lord Ashdown rallied the troops at the Lib Dem annual conference Lord Ashdown said: ""You can't be a party of government unless you are prepared to give up the politics of protest. ""The easy living that Lib Dems had for years had to be abandoned when we took on the burdens of government."" Mr Clegg will be hoping that those ""burdens of government"" can extend beyond the general election. He has already said publicly that he hopes to be in another coalition after 2015. But Mr Kennedy warns that the party needs to be more liberal and not get dragged into speculation over who it might do a deal with after the next election. ""The last thing we need is clouding people's comprehension or limiting our own political vocabulary by seeking to build bridges one way or the other for an election outcome that we remain completely unaware of"
" he said. So 2014 will be the year the Liberal Democrats try to differentiate themselves and to make their voice heard. But there will also be pressure mounting on Mr Clegg to say with whom he would make a deal and what price he would extract for his support in another coalition.

The European elections in May are not intended as a referendum"
 but there will be plenty of parties determined to make the vote about the European project itself. Across much of the EU
 anti-establishment parties have been polling strongly. They have very different agendas but most of them are anti-immigrant
 anti-euro
 anti-austerity and anti-Brussels and its power. Some of them
 like Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) in France and Geert Wilders's Freedom Party (PVV) in the Netherlands
" have been leading in the polls. The two leaders have formed a loose alliance to ""fight the monster called Europe"". If these anti-EU parties get above 30% of the seats they could disrupt the working of the increasingly important European Parliament. Two points worth remembering: these disparate parties will struggle to work together. Some are from the left"
 some from the far right and some
 like the Five Star Movement in Italy
 campaign against the political establishment. Also
 the stronger they poll the more likely it is that the established parties in the European Parliament will form alliances to push through their own agenda. In the UK
 Nigel Farage and the UK Independence Party (UKIP) will be wary of any alliance with parties which might be branded extreme. But expect an epic struggle: European leaders and the Brussels establishment will denounce these newer parties as extremists and xenophobes. They
 in turn
 will direct their fire on what they see as an out-of-touch elite. Struggle for top jobs The game is already under way in the corridors and friteries of Brussels: who will land the big jobs? The president of the Commission
 the president of the European Council and the president of the Parliament are all up for grabs. Already the jockeying for position has begun. Like a roll-call of the European establishment
 MEPs
 commissioners and former senior ministers like Schulz
 Rehn
 Verhofstadt
 Juncker
 Barnier
" Reding etc are all happy for it to be known they are available. But the real story is that the procedure for nominating the all-important post of President of the European Commission is messy and imprecise. No one knows the rules by which the game will be played. There is likely to be a tussle between the newly-elected European Parliament and national leaders over who makes the final choice. Diplomats are saying the game will be played ""late and fast"" and some are warning of ""severe institutional conflict"". European Council: 2014 will bring changes at the top in EU institutions The British member of the Commission is currently Cathy Ashton"
 the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. It will be hugely significant who the UK nominates as EU commissioner and what job in the Commission the UK government pursues. Two countries to watch The mood in France is sour. Protests are widespread. In Brittany there have been the stirrings of a tax revolt and the economy may head back into recession. President Hollande is struggling to make good on his promise to reduce unemployment by the end of 2013. The numbers of the jobless
 at 3.29 million
 are still rising
" albeit more slowly. Only a very loose interpretation of the statistics supports the president's statement that the ""reversal of the unemployment curve… has truly begun"". In the pipeline are more lay-offs. The sense of malaise may well reveal itself on the streets. And elsewhere in Europe there are mutterings that the French economy is holding back the rest of the eurozone. President Napolitano has been warning of social unrest with companies on ""the brink of collapse"". Here"
 too
" there is the emergence of popular anger with the ""Forconi"" (Pitchforks) protests. The country needs fundamental reform"
 both to its labour laws and its electoral system. But above all
 after 12 years of stagnation it needs growth. Italy is hoping that in exchange for implementing reforms Brussels will allow it flexibility on reducing its deficit. One sobering thought: over four years into this crisis Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio has jumped to 133%. Jobless recovery In the final weeks of 2013 Europe's leaders hammered together the outline of a banking union. There is still much to be argued over. But the real crisis in the EU is that 26 million people are out of work. In Spain
 for instance
 27% of the workforce is unemployed. There have been some glimmers of improvement but nothing to suggest significant falls in the numbers out of work. The Commission's own figures suggest a jobless recovery. The biggest fear in Brussels is of mounting frustration
" turning voters against the EU. ""What is at stake"
" said the head of the IMF Christine Lagarde, is Europe's potential for growth in the future"". It was apparent at the summit just before Christmas that the appetite for further reforms in the eurozone is waning while the markets remain calm. Further steps towards greater solidarity - like offering grants"
 loans and guarantees to help the struggling countries - were essentially kicked into the long grass. But the eurozone crisis is not over and for many of those countries forced to become more competitive there are severe social costs. Merkel 3 Angela Merkel begins her third term as German chancellor. Will she be the same cautious German leader as before? Or will she lead Germany into accepting greater responsibility for the rest of Europe? Already - as part of the coalition deal with the Social Democrats - there will be increased spending at home on social programmes like pensions. The retirement age for some German workers will actually fall and the new measures will add more than 20bn euros (£17bn; $27bn) to German budget expenditure. Countries in southern Europe - and France - are hoping for much more. They want to see Germany boosting domestic demand to help the exports of other eurozone countries and they hope the new coalition will soften Angela Merkel's insistence on austerity and structural reforms. World War 1 Much of Europe - in particular the French and the British - will hold ceremonies to remember what is known as the Great War. There will be significant commemorations marking the centenary of the outbreak of war. The Germans
 so far
 have proved less interested in remembering the 1914-1918 conflict. It is World War 2 that still shapes their politics and outlook towards Europe. But the centenary events will serve as a reminder about what inspired European integration and the creation of what became the European Union. Migration Migration will be a leading factor - particularly in Britain - in the run-up to May's European elections. It is clear that when working restrictions are lifted this week some Romanians and Bulgarians will seek work in Britain. If the numbers are significant the political pressures will build. Any further steps to restrict freedom of movement will lead to increasingly bitter words between European commissioners and the UK government. Brussels will continue to demand that evidence - numbers - be produced to show that migrants are moving in order to claim benefits. They will also fight to protect freedom of movement
" which is regarded as one of the cornerstones of the EU and its single market. The UK has potential allies over so-called ""benefits tourism"""
" but very few countries would be willing to weaken freedom of movement. What does the UK want? Those of us who spend time in Brussels and Europe's capitals are frequently asked ""what does the UK really want?"" Neither Europe's leaders nor officials are clear what the UK will seek as part of renegotiating its relationship with the EU . There are some countries that privately question whether the EU might not be better off without the UK"
 but they are very few in number. Some argue
 like the Italians
" that to have one of the strongest European economies outside the EU would damage the whole project. What Europe's leaders will hope is that in 2014 the British position becomes clearer. Will the UK insist on repatriating some powers? Will it seek to protect itself from ""ever closer union?"" When David Cameron speaks about reforms in the EU he has allies. It is wrong to portray the UK as entirely isolated"
 but building support for a more flexible EU and winning concessions will be a formidable task. What the British government will be looking for in 2014 are indications that Germany wants a new treaty - to give proper legal backing to the extra powers that the eurozone crisis has handed to Brussels. Treaty change would open the door for Britain to bring its demands to the table. So 2014 will reveal whether the EU has fallen out of favour with millions of Europe's voters. The biggest challenge is whether this union of 28 members can deliver growth and prosperity
 or whether years of stagnation lie ahead. Article written by Gavin Hewitt Gavin Hewitt Europe editor 13:57 UK time

Ten things about the independence referendum 10 things we discovered over the past 12 months http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25416782#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - Scotland's referendum: Ten things we learned in 2013 showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 29 December 2013 Last updated at 20:07 ET Scotland's referendum: Ten things we learned in 2013 By Jamie Ross BBC Scotland Continue reading the main story Treasury claims post-Yes funding gap MSPs to study impact of referendum Ministers quizzed on White Paper Retailers warn over Scotland costs The independence debate began to gather pace this year. Here
 are 10 things we discovered about the referendum during the past 12 months. 1. The question We now know what will be asked on the big day
" but writing the question wasn't straightforward . The Scottish government's initial suggestion - ""Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?"" - was examined and re-examined. But after much debate and consultation"
" it was settled: the Scottish people will be asked ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" The Scottish government's White Paper tackled many of the big issues surrounding the debate. However"
 tucked away on page 532 was an answer to the question on everyone's lips: it was confirmed that an independent Scotland would compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. 3. The referendum date This was a tricky one. Too early in the year then the weather might be terrible
 too near the middle of the year then the weather might be terrible
 and too late in the year then the weather might be terrible. That's just Scotland. As it happened
 they settled on 
 when there is at least a chance that voters will be able to travel to polling stations without the aid of a catamaran. 4. 16 and 17 year olds will be allowed to vote For the first time
" 16 and 17 year olds in Scotland will be able to use their vote on something more substantial than determining which celebrity triumphs in the Australian ""jungle"". But who will they vote for? That isn't certain"
 but the one thing that is guaranteed - both campaigns will be attempting to woo them on Twitter
" Facebook and other social media. 5. There will be a 16-week campaign period ""A week is a long time in politics"" said former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson. Well"
 the formal referendum campaign period
 starting on 30 May
" will see lots of ""long weeks"". Each campaign will have £1.5m to spend on winning votes over the three months - so watch out for many"
 many campaign fliers dropping through your letterboxes. 6. Alex Salmond and Beyoncé have something in common Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed to delegates at the SNP Party Conference in October the details of First Minister Alex Salmond's referendum diet. Both he and singer Beyoncé follow the same 5:2 fasting regime
 also known as the Bikini Panic Diet. ( PS
 Beyoncé has
 thus far
 remained neutral in the independence debate ). 7. White Papers are very long It turns out that a blueprint for national independence can result in a hefty read. At 670 pages
 the Scottish government's White Paper is roughly the same length as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and there isn't even a single dragon in it. It does
 however
 tackle all of what the Scottish government believes are the important referendum issues. You can download it or order a free copy here . 8. There will be no Cameron v Salmond stand-off We will see many fiery debates before next September. One we are being told we won't see
 is a TV showdown between Alex Salmond and David Cameron. The Prime Minister turned down the First Minister's invitation to a public debate
" saying it was just a ""convenient means of deflecting attention away from the real issues"". 9. BBC Scotland might become the SBS The White Paper said that"
 under independence
 BBC Scotland would be gradually transformed into the Scottish Broadcasting Service. This means that
 while the Scottish public would still be able to watch Dr Who and Eastenders
 it would have more stuff made for Scotland rather than for the whole of the United Kingdom. It also means that the broadcaster would have an enormous letter B and C to sell from the building of its Glasgow HQ. 10. Independence day? The USA has July 4. The Scottish government says that
" if Scotland votes ""Yes"" in 2014"
 it will have its independence day on . Will it happen? Let's wait and see what next year brings... Treasury claims post-Yes funding gap An independent Scotland would need to find an extra £1.6bn a year to pay for flagship policies such as free childcare

 but she was not the only former UK MP to pass away this year. (Read part one and two ) Wilfred Proudfoot
 19 December 1921 - 19 July 2013 Proudfoot (right)
 accompanied by fellow Conservative Sir Timothy Kitson Proudfoot
 a supermarket entrepreneur turned Conservative MP turned pirate radio manager turned hypnotist
 was born in Crook
 County Durham
 where he worked in a local self-service grocery shop run by his father
 according to his Yorkshire Post obituary . He borrowed money from family members
 adding funds he received after serving in the RAF
 and bought a former foundry building in Seamer
 near Scarborough
 turning it into a supermarket
 where he applied the self-service model to a larger scale
 the Yorkshire Post said. Over 30 years
 he built up a chain of 15 supermarkets
 the Telegraph's obituary reported
" and was ""elected a councillor in 1950"
" despite urging his supporters to vote Liberal to keep out the Labour candidate"". He chaired Scarborough Town Council's health committee from 1952 to 1958. He became an MP on his third attempt"
" winning Cleveland for the Conservatives in 1959. His subsequent campaign for currency reform earned him the nickname ""Decimal Proudfoot"""
 the Telegraph said. Despite a stint as parliamentary private secretary to Sir Keith Joseph
 then Minister of Housing and Local Government
 he lost his seat in 1964. A year later
 he led a consortium to set up a pirate radio station off Scarborough
 called Radio 270
 on board a 150-tonne fishing vessel
" the Yorkshire Post said. But this enterprise was brought to an end in 1967 after the passing of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act into law. ""If we'd had another year we would have made a profit"
" he reportedly commented. Proudfoot returned to the Commons in 1970, winning Brighouse and Spenborough by a tiny majority, and then losing it to the previous Labour incumbent in 1974. In the intervening period, he had focused on broadcasting issues, according to the Telegraph, criticising the BBC's provision of programmes for immigrants as inadequate and campaigning for a trial period of broadcasting from Parliament. He underwent cosmetic surgery in California to enhance his chances of getting back into Parliament"""
 according to his Times obituary . But
 political ambitions frustrated
" Proudfoot reinvented himself as a hypnotist. The Telegraph reported that he said it could cure ""anything from nail-biting to tennis elbow"". Proudfoot was"
 the Times concluded
" ""a versatile man of strong entrepreneurial instincts and not a little showmanship"". Lord Roberts of Conwy"
 10 July 1930 - 14 December 2013 The son of a manse in north Wales
 Roberts served for 15 years as a junior Wales Office minister under four Conservative secretaries of state and two prime ministers. After winning a scholarship to Harrow and completing his national service
 Roberts was posted to Vienna as a member of the intelligence corps before going to Oxford
 where he had a history scholarship. He trained as a newspaper reporter in Liverpool before starting work in broadcasting
 first as a journalist for BBC Wales and later in independent television. But Roberts gave up broadcasting for politics and won the marginal seat of Conwy from Labour in 1970
 holding it until he retired from the Commons in 1997. After Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 election
 he was made undersecretary of state in the Welsh Office where his responsibilities included the Welsh language - his native tongue. The campaign for a Welsh-language television channel
 which included the threat of a hunger strike by the former Plaid Cymru MP Gwynfor Evans
" eventually succeeded ""in part as a result of pressure from Roberts"""
 according to his obituary in the Telegraph . Despite speculation that Roberts would be promoted to secretary of state in the run up to the 1987 election
 the Telegraph added
" ""the thoroughly English [Peter] Walker got the job"
" making Roberts's background of even greater value"". Activists branded his Welsh Language Bill ""feeble and inadequate"""
 according to the Telegraph
 but it reached the statute book in 1993
 placing a duty on public bodies and the courts in Wales to treat Welsh and English equally. Roberts served as an opposition spokesman on Welsh affairs in the Lords until 2007
 and let a review of the Conservatives' policy towards devolution in 2008 which paved the way for creation of the Silk Commission into the Welsh settlement. Tony Speller
 12 June 1929 - 15 February 2013 Speller's dream of a career in the army was dashed in a car accident that injured his arm and shoulder
 according to the North Devon Journal's obituary . Instead
 in 1952
 he travelled to Nigeria
 then still a colony
 to market local produce for the UK government
 before going into business. After returning to Exeter
 where he had taken a BA in social studies - one of two undergraduate degrees - Speller launched a photocopying business in 1963
 and joined the city council. Contesting Devon North for the Conservatives in 1979
 his second attempt
 Speller succeeded in ousting the former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe
 who would subsequently stand trial on charges of conspiracy to murder. Thorpe was acquitted. Although he was to the right of his party
 his Times obituary noted
" Speller ""campaigned for alternative energy and came under attack in 1990 for suggesting that Exmoor was an ideal site for windfarms"". He served on the Commons energy committee from 1982 to 1988 and chaired the all-party alternative energy group from 1984 to 1992"
 when he lost his seat to Lib Dem Nick Harvey. Speller fought the closure of the Barnstaple-Bideford railway line and the dumping of sewage in the Bristol Channel
" the Times said. ""One of his crowning legacies"
" according to a former local Conservative official quoted in the North Devon Journal, was securing the construction of the long awaited North Devon Link Road"". Andy Stewart"
 27 May 1937 - 6 October 2013 Born in Lanarkshire to a farming family
" Stewart moved south at 24 to buy a 200-acre farm near Newark after graduating from the West of Scotland Agricultural College. ""He proved an astute farmer and expanded into both arable and livestock"
" according to his obituary in the Scotsman . After being active in local politics, he contested the new seat of Sherwood, which had a large working-class population, at the 1983 election. Few gave him a chance"
" even when the Conservatives opened up a big national lead over Labour"""
 the Telegraph's obituary said
" but he won with a slim majority of 658 votes after running what the Scotsman described as an ""imaginative campaign"". But his popularity soared in Sherwood after he backed the thousands of local miners refused to join the NUM-led strike. ""Despite his closeness to local miners"
 Stewart made no bones about being on the Right of his party
 voting for the death penalty
 supporting sporting links with South Africa and continually baiting Arthur Scargill
" the Telegraph added. He greatly increased his majority in 1987, and became a parliamentary private secretary, but lost his seat in 1992. Stewart returned to his farm, and served on the local county council until as recently as May this year. Sir Cyril Townsend, 21 December 1937 - 20 November 2013 A globe-trotting officer with the Durham Light Infantry who had studied at Sandhurst and saw active service in Cyprus in 1958 and Borneo in 1966, Townsend became an advisor to then opposition leader Ted Heath in 1968. After a spell in the Conservative Research Department, he stood in the 1974 general election for Bexleyheath, a new constituency. His Times obituary recorded that it was thought to be a marginal seat, but Townsend won it comfortably, and held it until 1997. As the Conservatives took power in 1979, Townsend served briefly as a parliamentary private secretary to then social security minister Reg Prentice, but resigned over curbs on the immigration of Asian fiancés"""
 according to his obituary in the Independent . Although a defender of the Trident nuclear weapons system
" Townsend was ""independent-minded"""
 relatively liberal
" and ""never likely to obtain office from Mrs Thatcher"""
 the Independent added. He joined the Commons foreign affairs committee in 1982
" but was ousted in 1983 after criticising government policy on the Falklands. Townsend demonstrated a strong interest in foreign affairs throughout his career. He was ""something of an idealist over Europe"""
 the Independent said
" and a ""convinced supporter of the Palestinian cause"". On the domestic front"
 he focused on preventing the abuse of children
 and brought forward the private member's bill which became the Protection of Children Act 1978. He was knighted on leaving Parliament in 1997. David Watkins
 27 August 1925 - 23 August 2013 Educated at Bristol's Merrywood Grammar School
 Watkins returned to the city of his youth after completing national service in the RAF and served on its council from 1954 to 1957. He stood unsuccessfully in the constituency of Bristol North West for Labour in 1964
 but won Consett in 1964 and held it until 1983. Watkins sponsored two private members' bills to reach the statute book: the Employers Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 and the Industrial Common Ownership Act 1976. After leaving the Commons
 he worked from 1985 to 1990 on the UN Meeting of Non-Governmental Organisations on Question of Palestine and ran the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding from 1983 to 1990. Jimmy Wray
 28 April 1938 - 25 May 2013 Wray represented Glasgow Provan and then Glasgow Baillieston for Labour for a total of 18 years
 spanning 1987 to 2005. Before standing for Parliament
" he served as a councillor in the city of Glasgow and on Strathclyde Regional Council. Wray was one of a family of nine and grew up in the Gorbals area of Glasgow. The Guardian's obituary described him as both a ""man of the left"" and a ""lifelong entrepreneur and close friend of the boxing fraternity"". ""His main political interests lay in countering the ills that most acutely affected the wellbeing of his constituents: poverty"
 drug abuse and knife crime
" the Guardian added, citing his successful piloting through Parliament of a private member's bill which restricted the sale of knives. He was also a staunch campaigner against fluoridation of the water supply. Sheila Wright, 22 March 1925 - 5 July 2013 Wright represented Labour on Birmingham City Council between 1956 and 1978 and on the West Midlands County Council between 1973 and 1981. She also served as a social worker from 1957 to 1974, before winning election to the Commons in 1979 and representing Birmingham Handsworth until 1983.

What is parliament and how does it work? Find out more about the Commons and Lords and how they work http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17827461#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa BBC News - What is parliament and how does it work? showAdAboveBlq: true showAdAboveBlq: true blqLeaderboardAd: true --> 29 May 2012 Last updated at 08:57 ET What is parliament and how does it work? Parliament is made up of two main sections
 the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Commons is the most powerful house
 but both are responsible for making laws and debating policies. Find out more about the political make-up of both houses and what they do by clicking on the image below. Click on the labels to find out more about the roles in parliament House of Lords Members of the House of Lords are not publicly elected. Historically the Lords were hereditary peers entitled to sit in the chamber because they held an inherited title such as duke
 marquess
 earl
 viscount or baron. These days most of the Lords are appointed by giving them the title of life peer - they make up 707 out of 824 members (excluding some through long-term sickness
 etc.). Life peers do not pass their title on to their children. Plans for further reform of the Lords are being considered. The main purpose of the Lords is to scrutinise proposed new laws to make sure they are fair and workable. Some government bills will be sent to the Lords for their first reading to spread the workload between the two houses. House of Commons The House of Commons is the most powerful of the two houses of parliament. It is made up of 650 MPs
 almost all members of political parties and each representing different constituencies or areas of the country. Policies and laws are debated here - although some powers have been devolved to Scotland
 Wales and Northern Ireland
 and some laws are made in Europe. Government The party which wins more than half the seats in the Commons wins the election and forms the government. The new prime minister makes about 100 MPs ministers. These ministers form the government and take the lead in representing key departments like justice and education. In the May 2010 election
 no one party had an absolute majority so the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats joined forces to create a coalition government. Liberal Democrats currently make up about a fifth of the coalition government. Cabinet The cabinet is the central decision-making group of parliament made up of about 20 ministers chosen by the prime minister. As the government is currently a coalition the deputy prime minister also has a say about who is in the cabinet. The first cabinet after the May 2010 election included 23 ministers - 18 Conservative and five Liberal Democrats. Cabinet members have a collective responsibility
 which means they all have to support any decisions which are taken. Opposition The opposition is usually the second-biggest party in parliament - since the May 2010 election
 this has been Labour. Twenty days in each parliamentary session are set aside for opposition day debates - 17 for the largest opposition party and three for the smaller parties. The opposition generally uses them to raise questions of policy and administration. The opposition leader challenges the prime minister during Prime Minister's Questions when he can ask six questions. Other parties Since the May 2010 election there are nine smaller parties represented by MPs in the house
 apart from the three main political parties. These include the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru
 as well as one Green party MP
 one Respect MP and one independent. Liberal Democrats The Liberal Democrats are part of the coalition
 so they sit on the government benches in the Commons. Nick Clegg
 the leader of the Lib Dems was made deputy prime minister after the May 2010 election and five more Lib Dems were included in the first cabinet. Lib Dem ministers in the coalition are bound by collective responsibility so they have to support cabinet decisions on key issues like the economy and foreign policy. But it has been agreed that Lib Dem MPs will be permitted to abstain in a vote in the Commons on certain issues where they disagree with the Tories. Backbenchers Backbenchers are MPs who don't hold ministerial or shadow cabinet posts. Lacking responsiblities to a department they aren't as bound to the government
 or front bench
 and can speak more freely and even vote against the government if they wish. They can sometimes introduce their own ideas for legislation in the form of a private member's bill. Backbenchers are so-called because they sit on the back row of benches. Prime minister The prime minister is usually the leader of the party with a majority of seats - i.e. more than half the MPs in parliament. The prime minister is responsible for choosing the cabinet and also has meetings with the Queen. He has to answer Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons every Wednesday. Questions can come from any MP on any subject. In the May 2010 election the Conservatives were short of an absolute majority. David Cameron became prime minister after forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Deputy prime minister Since the coalition was formed
 Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has been the deputy prime minister. Deputy PM questions are held about every five weeks. These 30-minute sessions cover the policy aspects the deputy PM is responsible for
 which include political and constitutional reform. He is also lord president of the privy council. As deputy PM
 he is consulted in any decision involving the prime minister Speaker The speaker is the chief officer of the Commons and is elected by MPs. He takes charge of debates in the Commons
" choosing which MPs should speak and calling MPs to ""order"" when debates become unruly. Although he or she is usually a member of one of the main parties"
 once elected the speaker puts party politics aside and has to act impartially. Leader of the opposition The person in charge of the opposition party becomes the leader of the opposition. Gordon Brown stood down as Labour party leader after losing the election in May 2010 and Ed Miliband won the subsequent contest for the leadership. There's also an opposition leader in the Lords. The opposition leader in the Commons picks members of the shadow cabinet. Each member of the shadow cabinet scrutinises a different government minister's department and devises policies in that departmental area. One of an MP's most important roles is to help make and change the laws governing the UK. Both houses of parliament generally have to agree on a new law - after a process which can take months
 or even years. Click through the slideshow to find out about the key stages in the passage of a bill. Continue reading the main story How new laws are made After a new government is elected
 the Queen makes a speech to Parliament which includes a list of bills or proposals for new laws. Some of these bills may have already been through one or two kinds of consultation: green papers contain ideas for bills
 white papers include more definite proposals. Most bills start in the Commons. The first reading is a formality. At the second reading MPs debate the main principles. In 2005 Labour had plans to extend maternity leave. The Work and Families bill had broad support at second reading so the bill moved to committee stage without the need for a vote. MPs can introduce their own legislation in the form of a private members' bill. In 2009 Labour MP Julie Morgan wanted a ban on under-18s from using sunbeds. She won government backing and her bill moved to the committee stage - without government support a bill is not likely to progress any further. All the bills that pass the second reading are considered by a public bill committee of at least 16 MPs. They consider a bill line by line and may introduce amendments. They can call experts to give evidence and they may meet several times before returning the bill to the Commons. At the report stage further changes can be made. At this point there could be a rebellion and parts of the bill might be defeated in a vote when MPs divide into two areas known as the Aye and No lobbies. The bill then moves to a third reading when there is often a brief debate before it goes to the Lords. A bill goes through the same process in the Lords. This time
 all members can take part at committee stage. Most bills need the Lords' approval but occasionally the Commons will use the Parliament Act to pass a bill into law. This happened in 2004 when the act was used to force through a hunting ban. Any Lords' amendments are returned to the Commons for consideration. A bill can go backwards and forwards several times before both houses agree on a final version and it gets the royal assent. Labour's bill on maternity leave was unopposed so it became an act that came into force in April 2007.
