"Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? Twitter stock as appreciated rapidly since its recent IPO, but is it worth the price? Find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/must-know-twitter-stock-hot-193451595.html Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? - Yahoo Finance Must-know: Twitter stock has been hot, but is it a good deal? December 30, 2013 2:34 PM Why Twitter is like the cronut—in demand, but hyped and overvalued (Part 1 of 5) One of the buzziest topics in the investing world lately has been Twitter (TWTR). The social media company was one of the most sought-after IPOs of the year as the stock popped to $44.90 per share on its first trading day, after the IPO priced at $26 per share. Since then, the stock has had a strong rally and closed on December 20, 2013, at $63.75 per share, resulting in a market cap of over $36 billion. However, the market’s perception of Twitter’s valuation is far beyond the company’s fundamental valuation. We’re not saying the stock will decline in price, but we can say that where it’s priced is probably not what it’s worth, and that relative to its comps, Twitter is probably too expensive. Read on to find out why we think Twitter is a bad deal from both a relative and absolute value perspective. Continue to Part 2 Browse this series on Market Realist: Part 2 - What is Twitter?

(NYSE: JKS) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/secondary-offerings-jinkosolar-shutterstock-send-161000001.html Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher - Yahoo Finance Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher September 20, 2013 12:10 PM It is not often that a secondary stock offering sends a company’s shares higher, but we are seeing that very phenomenon Friday morning. Chinese solar PV maker JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. ( JKS ) and stock image company Shutterstock Inc. ( SSTK ) both priced secondary offerings this morning and shares in both companies have risen sharply. At JinkoSolar, shares priced at $16.25, after closing Thursday night at $16.48, and shortly before noon the stock was up by 13.8% at $18.75. The company offered 3.8 million shares and an underwriters’ option on an additional 570,000. JinkoSolar says it will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include expanding its manufacturing capacity. That by itself should have sent shares down. ALSO READ: Famous Restaurant Chains That Are Hard to Find Shutterstock closed last night at $60.32 and priced its offering of 4.6 million shares at $60.00 this morning. The company is selling only 1 million shares; the rest are being sold by some existing shareholders. The underwriters have an option on an additional 690,000 shares. The company said the purpose behind the offering is to increase the company’s public float, among other things. As far as JinkoSolar is concerned, part of the reason for the price jump is almost certainly a short squeeze. Institutional investors also are likely the heaviest buyers as they move toward some momentum stocks to juice up returns. ALSO READ: The Countries with the Most Multimillionaires Shutterstock only had a public float of about 6.5 million shares, so it is likely adding liquidity. The stock is up more than 200% since the company’s IPO, and we can assume that there are real buyers out there who want in on the party. In addition, nearly 13% of the stock is held short, so there is some covering going on as well. Still, it is an interesting turn of events to see shares jump on secondary offerings. Shares of JinkoSolar are trading at $18.43 a few minutes after noon on Friday, in a 52-week range of $3.18 to $20.06. Shutterstock’s shares are up nearly 12% at $67.46, after posting a new 52-week high earlier this morning of $68.42. The 52-week low is the IPO price of $21.00.

We are seeing major ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-raising-over-3-billion-140056268.html Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales - Yahoo Finance Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales September 10, 2013 10:00 AM The stock market is looking healthier and healthier again, and it is not just because the S&P 500 is within striking distance of 1,700 and because the DJIA has crossed back over 15,000. We are seeing major secondary offerings from companies themselves and from their insiders and backers. When companies sell shares it is generally into a strong market. That being said, investors have to sometimes wonder if they want to buy stock when a company wants to sell more stock to the public. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked offerings from and involving the following companies: Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ); Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ), Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ), Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ), Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ), Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ), Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) and Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ). Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2014 What should really stand out here is not just that these combined offerings come to more than $2.4 billion. We did not include several other offerings, and those in total would come up to close to another $1 billion. We have added color and reference on each offering versus its average volume and size. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ) has an offering of 10,057,382 common shares held by Armstrong World Industries, Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust and Armor TPG Holdings. Note that the company has agreed to purchase 5,057,382 of the 10,057,382 common shares of this offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriter. Shares are trading at $52.37, and the 52-week trading range is $43.30 to $58.48. This is some $520 million in gross dollars, or about $250 million if you back out the shares being repurchased. Seven Highly Educated Jobs Making the Least Money Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ) has filed to sell 8 million of its listed shares (units). Proceeds will be used to invest in an equal number of i-units of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ). Enbridge Partners will then use the proceeds to purchase additional shares to repay its commercial paper, to finance a portion of its capital expansion program and for general partnership purposes. The ""Management-EEQ"" units are down 4% at $28.67, against a 52-week range of $25.81 to $32.30. The ""Partners-EEP"" shares closed at $30.20, versus a 52-week range of $26.88 to $33.49. This comes to almost $240 million before the exercise of any overallotment shares (units). Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ) is trading down by 4.6%, at $22.19 against a 52-week range of $21.03 to $26.01, after filing to sell 11 million common units. The gross proceeds appear to be around $242 million or so. Be advised that the units are being sold by its limited partners. Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ) already has filed to sell 6 million shares of its common stock, with 5.3 million being sold by existing shareholders and Marketo offering about 700,000 shares in the offering. This offering may seem small at about $200 million, but this is right into a lock-up period since its IPO came out in May. Many investors find offerings in bad taste on a ""Sell as immediately as you can,"" but this one did very well since its IPO as well. Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ) has priced a 25 million share offering of common stock to raise just over $600 million in gross proceeds. The company intends to use the net proceeds to originate and purchase additional commercial mortgage loans and other target assets and investments, and it included the ""for other general corporate purposes"" disclaimer in the release. The $600 million compares to a market cap of about $4.04 billion, while the 25 million shares compares to an average daily volume of about 2 million shares. Apple: What Happens When Everyone Knows About a Product Release? Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) is selling 4 million shares of its ordinary shares, representing close to $400 million in gross proceeds. Its market cap is just over $4 billion, and it trades about 825,000 shares per day on average. Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ) has done incredibly well as a stock, and it has now filed to sell roughly $175 million worth of its common stock. That would be roughly 1 million shares based on the current price, versus an average daily volume of only about 50,000 shares. Virtus has a market cap of $1.37 billion before the impact of this offering. These were just the offerings that we deemed to be of significant value. There were seven or eight other offerings that probably come close to another $1 billion or so in combined size. As a reminder, when companies and insiders sell more stock, those funds to purchase the new shares on the market generally are used in place of what would have otherwise been market-oriented stocks.

"We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen Don't expect a game changing tech IPO anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-living-tech-depression-andreessen-100130066.html We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen - Yahoo Finance We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen May 14, 2013 6:01 AM Don't expect a game changing tech initial public offering anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can manage, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday. ""When you say what's the next big IPO, the brutal truth is I don't know and I'm not sure there is going to be one for quite while because the incentives are so strong to keep these companies private,"" Andreessen said. : Software Out, Hardware Start-Ups In ) The hangover felt from the dot-com crash and financial crisis has spurred an era of over regulation in the public markets which has essentially caused a backlash from private companies that are refusing to go public, Andreessen said. Emerging entrepreneurs see the public markets as ""incredibly hostile,"" he said. ""The new running theory among new entrepreneurs is never take your company public or don't do it as long as you possibly can,"" Andreessen said. Andreessen, who has invested in tech companies including, Facebook ( FB ), Twitter, and Pinterest, said that another reason tech companies are hesitant to go public is because of the pain still felt from the dot-com crash. : Facebook in Talks to Buy Israel's Waze: Report ) ""A lot of people got burned during the dot-com crash, so I think we are living through the other side of that, I think we are living through sort of the tech depression, is the term I've used,"" he said. ""But at the same time I can tell you that the vast majority of the interesting new companies that are sort of at the $50 million to $100 million revenue stage,that have historically have been the source of the exciting IPOs that put growth into the market, those companies are quite simply staying private, they aren't going public."" : Signs of Another Tech Bubble: VC ) While there were about 8,800 public companies in 1997, there were about 4,100 publicly traded companies in 2012, a decline that can be contributed to a war being waged on the public markets via regulations like Sarbanes-Oaxley and Regulation FD, which were put in place to help derisk the market. But these regulations do more harm than good, Andreessen said. (Read More Below the Video.) ""We seem to have collectively decided as a society that we want to strip risks out of the public markets, so we had the dot-com crash, we had the financial crisis, and we decided that we don't like risk anymore,"" he said. ""So there have been a series of regulatory reforms, a series of corporate governance movements, and the result has been a huge disincentive for companies to go public, and of course the problem with that is if new companies don't go public then you get exactly what we are seeing, which is the number of public companies falling."" Because the number of public companies is falling, growth is being stripped out of the public markets, which will ultimately pave the way for a two-tiered system, he said. ""If you kill risk, you kill growth. If you kill growth you kill returns. And as a result the market is becoming a two-tiered system and I think that is bad,"" he said. ""Funds like ours-that primarily represent, frankly, rich people, rich people's pensions, rich people's colleges and foreign countries' sovereign wealth funds-generally, are doing fine."" However, he said that on the public side, growth is being drained out of the market, and that could hurt many Americans in the long-term. ""Of course the public market is where most ordinary Americans retirement savings is held in the form of mutual funds and pension funds and if we keep with this approach of over regulation in the public markets, we're not going to have returns for peoples' retirement accounts, which means people aren't going to be able to retire,"" he said. ""And I think that is going to be the big problem that comes out of that and I think that's where we are heading straight towards that right now.""

"Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO Will Hong Kong lose out on a hotly anticipated jumbo Chinese IPO? According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-may-choose-york-over-051625803.html Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO - Yahoo Finance Alibaba may choose New York over Hong Kong for its hotly anticipated IPO March 7, 2013 12:16 AM Will Hong Kong lose out on a hotly anticipated jumbo Chinese IPO? According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as the venue for its long-awaited listing. An IPO could value Alibaba at  more than $40 billion , making it potentially the biggest tech IPO in history . If the company chooses a US listing, that would be a further blow to the Chinese territory, where the value of IPOs on the stock exchange plummeted to a four year low last year as mainland China’s economic slowdown made investors less interested in allocating cash there. Chinese internet firms have a long record of choosing the Nasdaq over Hong Kong, mainly because they tend to be fast-growing but also young and loss-making.  The Hong Kong stock exchange requires companies conducting IPOs to have earned a profit for three years before going public. But Alibaba  is profitable  (its part-owner Yahoo discloses its finances).  So it would not be forced to choose a US exchange over Hong Kong in the way that Chinese  social networking business Renren , for example, had to. However, it would be not be unusual if Alibaba were meeting with banks and stock exchange representatives in Hong Kong and New York to see where it would get the best valuation for its shares. Investment bankers in both cities have been crowding around the company and trying to get hired on the IPO. It was reported  (paywall) last month that Alibaba executives were set to meet potential advisers to discuss a Hong Kong listing. Alibaba Group includes Alibaba.com, an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, and auction site Taobao. Alibaba.com was previously listed on the Hong Kong exchange. It was taken private by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma last year in a move widely viewed as a precursor to an IPO of his entire business. An Alibaba Group spokesman declined to comment.

"Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles Professional Diversity Network¡rsquo;s (NASDAQ: IPDN) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/professional-diversity-network-ipo-struggles-195953813.html Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles - Yahoo Finance Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles March 6, 2013 2:59 PM Professional Diversity Network’s ( IPDN ) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. The first stock to go public on a U.S. market in nearly three weeks, the Professional Diversity Network IPO declined 4% in its first day of trading and is down another 5.6% today. That doesn’t bode well for the provider of online networking and job opportunities for minorities, which went public below its expected range at $8 a share. It was also a lukewarm kickoff for the March IPO market on the heels of a busy first two months of 2013 . Twelve companies went public in January – the most since 2006. February brought another eight IPOs – less than the last two Februarys, but more than the previous three. The returns have been even better. Year-to-date, the 21 companies that have gone public have returned an average of more than 15%. Only five of them have actually fallen since their debuts – another bad sign for Professional Diversity Network. Up next on the IPO schedule are Artisan Partners Asset Management , a Wisconsin-based investment management business, and Silver Spring Networks , which provides smart grid products and services. According to IPO web site Renaissance Capital, no other public offerings are in the hopper – which could bode for a slower March than in recent years.

And a common point analysts raised just before its 2011 IPO was that Glencore’s majority shareholders may be selling out because they predicted the world resources “supercycle,” as commodities bulls used to call it, was about to be punctured. Glencore’s 2o12 earnings, released today, will have its IPO cynics chuckling at the prescience of their foresight. Last year, Glencore’s net income  crashed 75% . That was partly because of a decline in the value of Glencore’s stake in Russian aluminum producer Rusal, but generally because its sales prices declined as  China’s growth slowed . While the London and Hong Kong flotation  made billionaires of Glencore’s bosses, it’s not at all provable that CEO Ivan Glasenberg saw into the future with mystic accuracy before selling part of his company to outsiders. Maybe he just wanted to spread the fruits of his company’s success more widely and was as surprised by the supercycle accident as many others in the resources industry  (paywall). Still, the IPO timing looks brilliant for those who swapped large stakes in the business for cash. Here is what has happened to Glencore’s London share price (blue line) since its stockmarket debut and with the overall performance of the FTSE 100 (yellow line) provided for reference. Ouch.

"Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry.Analysts ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-hits-low-ipo-lock-143200785.html Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends - Yahoo Finance Facebook hits new low as IPO lock-up ends Facebook shares hit new depths as lock-up period ends, providing early investors with an out By Barbara Ortutay and Michael Liedtke, AP Technology Writers August 16, 2012 6:54 PM SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Facebook's stock plunged to a new low Thursday as some of the social networking leader's early backers got their first chance to sell their shares since the company's initial public offering went awry. Analysts interpreted the unusually high trading volume as a clear sign that at least a few of the insiders were seizing on a fresh selling opportunity. That is stirring a debate over whether they're simply locking in long-awaited gains on investments made many years ago or bailing out of a company that has lost its luster. A breakdown on just how many major Facebook Inc. shareholders sold their stock probably won't be available until next week at the earliest. Securities regulations give them at least three business days before they have to disclose such transactions. The information is important ""because if you are an investor who has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy the stock, you might decide to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after seeing which insiders decided to sell their stock,"" CapStone Investments analyst Rory Maher said. All told, investors who owned a combined 271 million Facebook shares could have sold their holdings Thursday with the expiration of a ban known as a lock-up period. The restrictions were imposed on a group of venture capitalists, companies and Silicon Valley cognoscente who invested in Facebook during its formative years and sold some of their holdings three months ago when the company went public at $38. The highly anticipated IPO had valued the company at $104 billion, similar to those of Amazon.com Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. The shares have plunged by nearly 50 percent since then amid concerns about whether Facebook is destined to become a passing fancy and worries about whether it will be able to sell more advertising on mobile devices as users gravitate there. Facebook' stock traded as low as $19.69 before bouncing back slightly. The shares closed Thursday at $19.87, down $1.33, or more than 6 percent. The previous low during the day was $19.82 and the previous low for a close was $20.04, both reached Aug. 2 More than 156 million shares were traded, more than five times the stock's average volume over the past month. Trading in the overall market was lighter than usual. The Facebook investors eligible to sell their shares Thursday included venture capital firms Accel Partners and Greylock Partners; investment banker Goldman Sachs Group; software maker Microsoft Corp.; Zynga Inc. CEO Marc Pincus; LinkedIn Corp. Chairman Reid Hoffman; and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. If there was mass selling within this group, Facebook's stock could decline further because the market would be flooded with nearly two-thirds more shares. Given that most of these investors put their money into Facebook five to eight years ago, they probably were eager to sell, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, a research firm that follows privately held companies. ""A lot of people have been waiting,"" he said. ""Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago."" Despite the sharp drop in Facebook's market value during the past three months, the early investors can still reap huge windfalls by selling at the current price. For instance, Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, the year CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the site in a Harvard dorm room. After selling 16.8 million shares for $640 million at the time of the initial public offering in May, Thiel still owned nearly 28 million shares worth about $560 million at Thursday's trading prices. Accel Partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook in 2005. The firm sold nearly 58 million shares for $2.2 billion as part of Facebook's IPO and still owned nearly 144 million shares worth about $2.9 billion. It wasn't known how many of those shares could have been sold Thursday, and whether any of them were. Because those investors had put up little compared with the shares' value today, ""you can understand why they would want to take some of their money off the table now,"" Maher said. ""But at the same time, you have to wonder if they're thinking that Facebook isn't much of a bargain anymore."" Hamadeh believes the venture capitalists who invested in Facebook realize it's a ""fool's game"" to wait for a better price on the stock. On the flip side, other key investors seem unlikely to sell additional shares right away. Microsoft, which invested $240 million in Facebook in 2007, relies on Facebook's social network to help bring more traffic to its Bing search engine, making it less likely that it would risk antagonizing Facebook executives by bailing out. The software company also doesn't need the money, as it is already is sitting on $63 billion in cash. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment Thursday. The selling shackles will come off of an additional 1.66 billion locked-up Facebook shares during the next nine months to place more potential pressure on the stock. One of the biggest tests will come in November when about 1.2 billion insider shares will be eligible for sale. The freed-up shares will include those owned by Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO and founder who sold 30 million shares for $1.1 billion in the May IPO to cover his taxes. Other Internet companies that have gone public in the past year have been hit hard by the expiration of their lock-up periods. On Tuesday, shares of online reviews service Angie's List suffered their biggest one-day drop so far and closed at a new low following the expiration of a similar ban. The price dropped, even though there was no word on whether any of the major investors had dumped their shares. LinkedIn, which runs a professional networking version of Facebook, also took a big hit when restrictions on insider selling lifted last November. Its shares sank to their trading low of $55.98 after the lock-up period expired, but have since rebounded strongly. The shares closed at $103.99 Thursday, more than twice its IPO price of $45. It appears some investors believe Facebook's stock price is nearing its low point, at least until the next lock-up periods end this fall. Short sellers, a type of investor that bets certain stocks will fall, had been intensifying their focus on Facebook since the company's July 26 report of disappointing revenue growth during the second quarter. To wager against a company, short sellers must borrow the stock of other investors and then make money by paying back the shares at a lower price. The amount of borrowed Facebook shares had spiked from about 70 million before Facebook's second-quarter earnings report to about 92 million at the end of Thursday's trading, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of SunGard Astecs Analytics, which tracks short-selling activity. But sentiments started to shift Thursday as the volume of shares being returned to the lenders outstripped the number being borrowed, Smith said. The cost to borrow Facebook shares also has been declining, a sign that short-selling demand is waning. ""Facebook's stock might be finally bumping along its bottom,"" Smith said. Considering the heavy trading volume, Facebook's stock would have fallen more dramatically if buyers hadn't stepped in, said Louise Yamada, a technical analyst who runs her own research firm. She suspects Facebook insiders are being careful not to flood the market with stock. ""They're smart enough to know if they sell at the same time, the stock would fall,"" Yamada said. It has been a rough run for Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook had perhaps the most-botched stock market debut as glitches marred its first day of trading. Things have gotten progressively worse as Facebook's market value has plunged by about $49 billion. The downfall stems from doubts about Facebook's ability to fend off intensifying competition from Internet search leader Google Inc. while trying to develop a plan for increasing the amount of revenue that it brings in from a worldwide audience of 955 million users. The uncertainty means Facebook's stock is likely to be volatile until the end of the year when the majority of the lockups expire. Hamadeh views the end of those selling constraints as a ""dark cloud on the horizon."" ""There is no way around it. It'll be painful,"" he said. ""But hopefully once that selling pressure is gone, it will find its floor and could be a basis for a more stable stock through 2013."" __ AP Business Writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this story.

At its peak, the stock traded at nearly $600, versus around $500 now. With earnings expected after the close Thursday, investors will be looking for any sign that the mounting controversy and legal issues over the injuries and deaths allegedly related to da Vinci procedures are affecting the company's growth. (Read More Below the Video.) : What Happens When the Surgical Robot Malfunctions? ) Over the past two quarters, growth in sales and profits slowed considerably, but it is still robust by most standards, with sales in the fourth quarter leaping 23 percent. Driving gains has been growing use of the da Vinci for hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures. Forecasts for this quarter are for earnings per share of 43 cents on revenue of $282 million. But as more reports of complications have come to light, the da Vinci debate is heating up. In late February, the FDA launched a probe calling for voluntary information from hospitals and surgeons using the da Vinci, in an effort to determine ""if the rise in reports may be a true reflection of problems."" Speaking at an investor meeting in early March, the company said, ""The relationship we have with the FDA has been a long and very strong relationship."" In mid-March the American Congress of Obstetricians and and Gynecologists issued a statement, warning that ""studies show there is a learning curve with new surgical technologies, during which there is an increased complication rate."" Robotic Surgery: Growing Sales, but Growing Concerns ) And five days later, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine weighed in with an advisory citing an ""increasing number of reports of patient complications associated with robot-assisted surgery."" In a statement to CNBC, Intuitive said: ""In any definitive treatment for complex disease, such as surgery of the cancerous prostate, heart, or other major organs there are risks of complications. Robotic surgery has proven benefits in reducing the risk and complications associated with open surgical procedures thereby extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to a broader population of patients. Overall, adverse event rates are very low. Da Vinci surgery has been shown to be safer than the open surgery alternatives in numerous independent large scale, peer reviewed studies.""

"A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-week-ipos-more-coming-142923777.html A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming - Yahoo Finance A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming April 12, 2013 10:29 AM Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, April 11, 2013. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. This was a big week for IPOs, in terms of number and how well most of them did. Six companies went public this week, and about $1.5 billion was raised. Four of the six increased the number of shares offered, or priced above the expected range, or both. That is bullish. You don't see this type of activity in a bear market. For the first quarter about $7.8 billion was raised, according to John Fitzgibbon at IPO Scoop. That is much better than the first quarter of 2012, when $5.9 billion was raised. The IPO market is a follower, not a leader ... but it's catching up. And there are more coming. Seven IPOs are on tap for next week, looking to raise $1.9 billion. Another big one was just announced: HD Supply Holdings (12 percent owned by Home Depot) filed for a large ($1 billion) IPO. The company went private for $8.5 billion in 2007. (More From CNBC: Cramer Says Wells Fargo Missed a 'Great Mortgage Moment' ) Two IPOs priced overnight: Payment processing company Evertec (to be traded under the symbol ""EVTC"") priced 25.3 million shares at $20, the high end of the price range of $18 to $20 a share, while Rally Software (""RALY"") priced 6 million shares $14. That is above the initial share count of 5.75 million and above the price talk of $11 to $13 a share. Rally provides cloud-based systems for Agile software development projects, which is a methodology for best practices in developing software. 1) JPMorgan Chase: Poke all the holes you want. It continues to hit the numbers, and it's got a ton of money. The usual pundits are coming on, complaining about ""earnings quality."" They do this every quarter. You can say it's making its numbers because it is releasing reserves, you can say it's because it is cutting costs, but still. JPMorgan is making its numbers. Yes, low rates hurt margins, but we've seen that for three years and guys are still finding ways to make money. It is also planning to raise its dividend...it now has a 3.2 percent dividend yield, and is continuing to buy back stock. (More From CNBC: 5 Fiscal Secrets Buried Deep in Obama's Budget ) JPMorgan current earnings estimate for 2013 is about $5.50 a share; it could do $6 a share. That's 8.3 times earnings, with a 3.2 percent dividend. That's not awful. JPMorgan has something like $21 billion in reserves it can release. It can buy back stock, increase its dividend, and still get to 9 percent Tier One capital. And if there is any hint that rates are going to go up, this company will explode. 2) Everyone's getting bearish! What's up with sentiment? Lots of talk last night about the huge plunge in bullish sentiment for the weekly AAII Investor Sentiment Survey. Bullish sentiment is at 19.3 percent for the week ending April 10, down 16.2 points from the prior week, the lowest level since March 5, 2009. Wow. The historic average is 39 percent. Bearish sentiment went to 54.5 percent, up 26.3 points from the prior week, the highest pessimism level since July 8, 2010. Some are noting that there was an unusually low level of respondents this week ... maybe the bears are just more motivated! 3) Finally, a downgrade of two big consumer names. It's been quite a ride for big consumer names this year. Coca-Cola has gone from $36 to $41 a share, PepsiCo has gone from $68 to $80 a share this year and is at an historic high. Today Davenport downgraded both to ""neutral"" on valuation, but also noted that for Coca-Cola was likely ""weaker than expected."" It certainly is a bit of a mystery why these stocks have been flying: Coke had only 1 percent volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is trading at roughly 19 times forward earnings. Pepsi is trading at 18 times forward earnings. 3) Gold collapses, breaking to near 12-month lows.

"Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut Two IPOs hit the market today ¡ndash; with two very different first-day performances. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/model-n-tetraphase-ipos-debut-205808421.html Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut - Yahoo Finance Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut March 20, 2013 4:58 PM Two IPOs hit the market today – with two very different first-day performances. Model N ( MODN ) , a provider of revenue management software to the life science and technology sectors, was up 28% in its debut despite pricing above its expected range. The stock went public at $15.50 a share, ahead of its predicted $12.50-$14.50 range. But that didn’t stop it from rising all the way to $19.84 on Wednesday. Tetraphase Pharmaceutical’s ( TTPH ) IPO wasn’t quite as effective. A developer of antibiotics that treat serious abdominal and urinary tract infections, Tetraphase shares priced at $7 a share – well below the $10 to $12 range listed in the company’s original IPO filing. The stock didn’t budge from there, finishing at exactly $7 after rising as high as $7.50. Six more companies are scheduled to go public in the coming days, including another pharmaceutical company called Enanta. Tetraphase’s first-day struggles likely have Enanta officials a bit more apprehensive about their company’s IPO. On the flip side, Marin Software is surely encouraged by Model N’s smashing debut. That should embolden the San Francisco-based cloud-computing company ahead of its IPO, which could come by week’s end. Model N and Tetraphase were just the fourth and fifth companies to go public this month. More From Wyatt Investment Research Fed Meeting By the Numbers How is March Madness Useful in Investing?

And there are several reasons why 360buy should in fact wait even longer. While  IPO rumors have come and gone , the latest reason for the speculation is the  similar chatter about Alibaba Group , China’s largest e-commerce company and 360buy’s biggest rival. (Alibaba’s TMall is thought to have some 45% of the business-to-consumer (B2C) market share , compared with 360buy’s 17%.) Some say an imminent Alibaba listing puts pressure on 360buy  to move first in order to beat Alibaba to the punch. But investors in an IPO will ask whether 360buy can make a real profit, and some analysts doubt it.  360buy follows an Amazon model when it comes to logistics and, as a result, it is burning through cash to expand its capacity in deliveries, warehousing and inventory. Furthermore, many of its products are low-margin electronic goods. That pits it against Suning Appliance, a brick-and-mortar retailer listed in Shanghai which is breaking into e-commerce, and is planning to  spend $3.5 billion on ramping up . Alibaba follows a different model—one that’s high-margin and low-cost. That means apple-to-apple comparisons with 360buy aren’t entirely appropriate. Alibaba’s TMall is a collection of thousands of virtual stores for brands like Prada, Gucci, Gap and, as of yesterday, Microsoft . Those stores handle the deliveries, which means Alibaba doesn’t rack up high capital costs; the company doubled its net income to $273 million in the second quarter of last year. As a result, for Alibaba an IPO is logical for funding its growth. The company may go public in the fourth quarter this year, though no decisions have been made, according to sources. Where 360buy sees TMall’s Achilles heel, the source told Quartz, is in logistics. TMall doesn’t handle deliveries, so it’s unusually vulnerable to bottlenecks in China’s backward parcel delivery system. It recently formed a coalition with delivery and real estate companies to help get around this. 360buy wants to invest in warehousing and logistics to give itself a competitive edge, the source said. Last month 360buy raked in $700 million in its latest fundraising round—enough cash to make the final push toward profitability and making a public listing a medium-term goal, the industry source said. CEO Richard Liu said he expects to be  profitable only in 2014  (link in Chinese), though the source said that could happen as soon as the end of 2013. But most of that $700 million will go into building up its logistics, putting further pressure on its already low-margin business and making an IPO premature.  Another sign that it’s too early for 360buy to consider listing is that valuation estimates have been in flux, when they normally go steadily up for a company in pre-public mode. All this suggests 360buy isn’t ready to start unveiling its financials, much less go on a road show to pitch the company. If it sells itself too early to investors, it risks having its IPO become a flop. Even if Alibaba beats it to going public, 360buy is better off waiting to solidify its business first.

The company had waited a long time before going public (it filed its initial paperwork in 2011) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-spring-ipo-showed-mix-203114458.html Silver Spring’s IPO showed the right mix of art and science - Yahoo Finance Silver Spring’s IPO showed the right mix of art and science March 14, 2013 4:31 PM Smart power grid company Silver Spring Networks had some doubters before its IPO debuted on March 13. The company had waited a long time before going public (it filed its initial paperwork in 2011) and green tech stocks haven’t been embraced by the market. But when the IPO finally came,  the stock jumped by almost 30% after its debut, showing a successful IPO is just as much about art as it is science. The IPO market has been rife with cautionary tales lately, leading some to question the mechanisms used to price and assess demand. Some like Facebook  seem overpriced and then drop in the market after going public, while others like LinkedIn jump so much that underwriters are accused of underpricing the IPO. The New York Times recently argued that Goldman Sachs severely underpriced  the 1999 eToys IPO —though others argued it was overpriced given the fundamentals of eToys, which later went out of business. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for setting an IPO. The science—the numbers for revenue, customers and profitability—is important, helping establish an IPO’s timing and the share price range. But then comes the art, which is in the form of the IPO road show. This is when the company and its underwriters tell their story, in addition to assessing investor appetite and concerns. Facebook did a bad job of both. During the road show, some investors expressed concerns about the company’s future growth, especially because Facebook released some negative information about its mobile advertising during that time. Instead of taking investors’ worries as a hint to be more conservative on the IPO, Facebook and its lead underwriter went the other way. For Silver Spring, the company and its underwriters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, knew they had to explain to investors why they waited so long to go public, according to sources. But they also talked about the company’s growth prospects, including in places like South America and Asia, and other promising data, the sources said. And they made the pitch to the kinds of investors who understand Silver Spring’s niche business. Silver Spring also wanted the stock to go up by a reasonable amount after it debuted, sources added; this “pop” has psychological value. So the pricing was relatively conservative. But after getting signs of interest from investors, Silver Spring increased the quantity of shares it would sell, albeit not by too much; and it didn’t alter the $17 price. It remains to be seen whether Silver Spring can sustain its IPO bump. But it was trading just above $22 in its second day on the market. And an IPO that had its naysayers is now being seen as a positive sign for  investors in green energy technology, and in the tech market in general.

"The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price He also predicted how Facebook would IPO. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-guru-nailed-apple-reveals-144217092.html The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price - Yahoo Finance The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price May 23, 2012 10:42 AM Aswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary finance professor, has made two monster calls in recent weeks: 1) He sold Apple near the top after holding it for 15 years. 2) He said Facebook would be a "" Goldilocks IPO ""—not too hot, not too cold. That latter call may still be up for debate.  But the bottom line is that it neither surged, nor totally collapsed. In a new guest post on Forbes.com , Damodaran offers a valuation for Facebook: .  That gives the social network a market capitalization of about $70 billion. ""Yes, Facebook can be valued,"" he wrote. Here are the assumptions and caveats he employs in his valuation model: : ""...If the company can maintain a compounded revenue growth of 40% for the next 5 years , with growth rates scaling down after that towards the growth rate of the economy, the firm will have revenues of $44 billion in ten years, which would put it on the same growth path as Google in its first years as a public company."" : ""...If Facebook is able to maintain a (close to Apple’s, and higher than Google’s) as a mature company, it would be pulling off a very difficult feat."" : ""As Facebook’s revenue grows, it will find itself under pressure to pay more for this growth ..."" : ""There is significant risk in the company. In valuing the company,  we use a cost of capital of 11.42% , which would put Facebook in the top quartile of publicly traded U.S. firms in terms of risk."" Damodaran, being a value investor isn't ready to buy. ""With its user base, Facebook has the ingredients to generate sizable profits down the road, albeit with substantial risks along the way,"" he wrote.  ""At the right price, I would buy the company, notwithstanding the uncertainty about the future. At the IPO offering price or even at the price at which it is trading at right now, I would not."" Read the whole post at Forbes.com .

On the ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lessons-facebook-ipo-130719545.html Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO - Yahoo Finance Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO May 23, 2012 9:07 AM I have no idea whether Facebook stock will ultimately pan out to be a solid investment. In the short term, the stock is in the red following its IPO debut. A few thoughts: IPOs can be hit or miss. On the plus side, Google debuted in August of 2004 at $85 per share and currently trades at just over $602 per share, a handsome return for longer-term shareholders. The stock peaked at over $700 per share in late 2007 and fell to under $300 per share by late 2008 during the market meltdown. The other side of this coin, at least so far, is Groupon. The company's shares debuted in November of last year at $20 per share, hit a high of just over $31, and currently trade at just under $12 per share. The company's business model and accounting practices have come under question in recent months. Individual stocks can carry great rewards and great risks. I do not deal with individual stocks on behalf of my clients, with the exception of those clients who receive company stock as part of their compensation or those clients who brought individual stock holdings with them when they became clients. Asset allocation and risk control via mutual funds and ETFs works very well for my client base. That said, there is no combination of funds and ETFs that would have provided a return anywhere near what Apple stock has over the past decade plus. However, for every Apple or Google, there is a Microsoft or General Electric. The latter two companies' stock has basically been dead money for the past ten years. Both companies have failed to beat the anemic performance of the S&P 500 Index over the past decade. Microsoft was once itself a high flier. Its stock price broke $10 per share in 1996 and rose to over $58 during 1999. The stock has languished in the $20s for most of the period since 2000, with a few brief exceptions. Individual holdings can also be subject to event risk. An example of this was Union Carbide (now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical) after the disastrous chemical leak in Bhopal, India in 1984. The stock price dropped sharply in the wake of this tragedy. BP's stock was almost $78 per share in late 2007, but it fell to below $30 per share in the wake of the Gulf oil spill. The stock has recovered a bit and currently hovers near $40 per share, but this is still well off of its high. Many investors have no sell discipline. Finding a good price at which to buy an individual stock is much easier than determining when to sell it. Worse yet, I've seen too many investors who refuse to sell a stock in which they have a loss until they break even. Successful investors have sell discipline. Whether you invest in individual stocks and bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or a combination of these, some basic investing principles should apply: --Invest with a goal in mind, ideally as part of your overall financial plan. -- Diversification is important. -- Control risk . --Rebalance periodically. --Review and monitor your individual holdings. While all of the hype over IPOs like Facebook's is interesting, it should be largely irrelevant to most investors. , CFP®, is a fee-only financial adviser at Asset Strategy Consultants based in Arlington Heights, Ill., where he provides advice to individual clients, retirement plan sponsors, foundations, and endowments.

But it has already set a strong example for entrepreneurs who want to build their companies into influential game-changers instead of taking a safer route--selling out to a competitor or a goliath. [ Photo gallery: A Look Back at Kodak. ] Even after it goes public and must, theoretically, answer to shareholders, Facebook and its 28-year-old CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will retain an unusual level of autonomy. The public offering has been structured so that Zuckerberg himself will retain enough voting power to make unilateral decisions, if he chooses to--as he apparently did when single-handedly negotiating the recent $1 billion purchase of Instagram. Few company founders, if any, get such an influx of new capital while retaining so much control over their firms. That could end up being a risky business strategy, but for now, it's heartening to entrepreneurs eager to stick with their firms for the long haul. Since the recession hit in 2008, skittish lenders and weak financial markets have depressed the market for initial public offerings and forced many promising startups into the arms of healthier acquirers. Pure Digital, which made the popular Flip video camera, was acquired in 2009 by Cisco--which shut down the Flipcam operation just two years later. Personal-finance startup Mint.com was purchased by Intuit and rolled into its broader lineup of productivity offerings. Google bought Zagat and more than 50 lesser-known companies over the last three years, merging many of them into its existing platform of offerings. [ See why Mark Zuckerberg might be too successful. ] There's nothing wrong with selling your company to a corporate giant, especially if you're an entrepreneur who's eager to do something else or who simply wants the big payday. But acquired companies often lose their mission and sometimes their entire identity. Instead of growing into independent companies that hire people, build a following, and make an impact, they become indistinct parts of a corporate bureaucracy. Some analysts feel the trend toward ""flipping"" companies can erode the self-reinforcing culture of entrepreneurship in places like Silicon Valley, where startups often rely on the cultivation of others who have built their own firms into powerhouses. ""If you create a mercenary culture, it will kill the goose that laid the golden egg,"" says Andy Rachleff, a former venture capitalist who's now CEO of personal-finance startup Wealthfront.com. ""You solve little incremental things, but they don't make much of an impact on society."" Rachleff says entrepreneurs start new companies for three basic reasons: to make a lot of money, to build a great enterprise, or to change the world. Those goals aren't mutually exclusive, obviously, but Zuckerberg has made it clear that his primary intent with Facebook is to change the world (even if he gets rather rich in the process). [ See where the jobs are, and the college grads aren't. ] In an open letter contained in the official registration documents filed with the government, Zuckerberg stated that ""Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission--to make the world more open and connected."" He then went on to explain how its entire business strategy is built around that goal--whether shareholders like it or not. Other startup CEOs can only wish they had the standing to dictate terms to their investors, since lenders are firmly in the driver's seat these days. After peaking in 2007, the number of U.S. IPOs plunged in 2008 and 2009, according to consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers. The IPO market recovered somewhat in 2010, then fell back in 2011. This year, it's on a pace to eclipse last year's activity, but it's still about 30 percent below the pace of deals in 2007. ""It's starting to look normal,"" says Henri Leveque, a partner at PwC. ""We're seeing enough of these to feel good about people's confidence in capital markets."" If the Facebook offering goes well, it could generate more enthusiasm for other IPOs believed to be in the works, involving companies such as Airbnb, Dropbox, LivingSocial, Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter, and Workday. One thing many young firms have going for them these days: They've come of age in a tough economy, which means they're pretty durable. ""Recent IPOs have had solid management teams or sophisticated financial sponsorship,"" says Leveque. ""They're real companies."" Maybe some of them will even stick around for a while. ick Newman is the author of Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback to Success. Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.

By Barbara Ortutay, AP Technology Writer May 14, 2012 10:17 AM FILE - In this May, 26, 2010 file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the social network site's new privacy settings in Palo Alto, Calif. Zuckerberg and other executives addressed about 200 prospective investors Friday, May 10, 2012 at a hotel luncheon in Silicon Valley. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) -- He famously wears a hoodie, jeans and sneakers, and he was born the year Apple introduced the Macintosh. But Mark Zuckerberg is no boy-CEO. Facebook's chief executive turned 28 on Monday, setting in motion the social network's biggest week ever. The company is expected to start selling stock to the public for the first time and begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday. The IPO could value Facebook at nearly $100 billion, making it worth more than such iconic companies as Disney, Ford and Kraft Foods. At 28, Zuckerberg is exactly half the age of the average S&P 500 CEO, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. With eight years on the job, he's logged more time as leader than the average CEO, whose tenure is a little more than seven years, according to Spencer Stuart. Even so, the pressures of running a public company will undoubtedly take some getting used to. Once Facebook begins selling stock, Zuckerberg will be expected to please a host of new stakeholders, including Wall Street investment firms, hedge funds and pension funds who will pressure him to keep the company growing. Young as he may seem — especially in that hooded sweatshirt — Zuckerberg will be about the same age as Michael Dell and older than Steve Jobs when those two took their companies, Dell Inc. and Apple Inc., public. In his years as Facebook's CEO he's met world leaders, rode a bull in Vietnam while on vacation, started learning Mandarin Chinese and as a personal challenge, wore a tie for the better part of a year. Facebook, of course, got its start in Zuckerberg's messy Harvard dorm room in early 2004. Known as Thefacebook.com in those days, the site was created to help Harvard students — and later other college students — connect with one another online. The scrappy website later grew to include high-schoolers, then anyone else with an Internet connection. Today more than 900 million people log in at least once a month, making Facebook the world's definitive social network. All along, Zuckerberg has shown a maturity beyond his years. As the site grew rapidly and caught the eye of big media and rival Internet companies, Zuckerberg consistently rebuffed mouth-watering buyout offers, including those from Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. ""Simply put: we don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his letter to prospective shareholders. ""And we think this is a good way to build something. These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits."" People who've observed Zuckerberg closely say his age is an asset. His is the generation that grew up with social networking, with computers all around them and the Internet as something that's always existed. Many of his employees are younger than him, as are a lot of the up-and-coming technology entrepreneurs with whom he competes. ""I don't think you could build a company like this if you were an old guy like me,"" says David Kirkpatrick, a 59-year-old author who chronicled the company's early history in ""The Facebook Effect."" Kirkpatrick, who is also founder of Techonomy, a media company that hosts conferences on the relationship between technology and economy and social progress, first met Zuckerberg six years ago. He says he was impressed with his vision, even then. ""It's the willingness to take risks, the willingness to abide by a very contemporary vision ... I don't think that he's too young. I think most CEOs are too old."" Zuckerberg, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif. with his girlfriend and a white Hungarian Puli dog named Beast, has matured as a leader with the help of experienced mentors. One of his closest advisers is Sheryl Sandberg, whom he hired away from Google in 2008. Zuckerberg, known for sometimes-awkward public appearances, realized that the razor-sharp, people-savvy advertising executive complements his own shortcomings. Sandberg is Zuckerberg's No. 2, the chief operating officer who oversees advertising and often serves as Facebook's smiling, public face. Then there's Donald Graham, the 66-year-old CEO and chairman of The Washington Post Co., who serves as a mentor to Zuckerberg and holds a seat on Facebook's board of directors. Rebecca Lieb, analyst at the Altimeter Group, says Zuckerberg has assembled a team of ""truly exceptional lieutenants."" David Ebersman, Facebook's chief financial officer, who hails from biotech firm Genentech, is another example. Zuckerberg hired him in 2009, saying that Ebersman's previous job, helping to scale the finance organization of the fast-growing biotech company ""will be important to Facebook."" He was right. Facebook's revenue grew from $777 million in 2009 to $3.7 billion last year. In the first quarter of 2012 it was more than $1 billion. Even so, Zuckerberg still has a lot to learn. As part of Facebook's pre-IPO ""road show"" last week, Zuckerberg visited several venerable East Coast financial institutions wearing his signature hoodie. While Silicon Valley insiders defended his fashion choice, others saw it as a sign of immaturity. Was it, as some speculated, a sign of a rebellious 20-something acting out? For Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities, Zuckerberg's attitude and attire symbolizes ""a level of aloofness to stakeholders."" ""He seems very customer focused and very employee focused. I am not sure he cares about anyone else. ... If he's going to go public, he has to answer to shareholders,"" Pachter says. ""That's why Google hired Eric Schmidt. That's why Steve Jobs was ultimately forced out of Apple."" Jobs, in fact, was another Silicon Valley luminary who had Zuckerberg's ear. He was 25 in 1980 when Apple went public. He was ousted five years later after clashing with John Sculley, the former Pepsico executive Apple hired as chief executive. Jobs famously returned to lead Apple in 1997 and the company has thrived since. Not much is known about the relationship Jobs and Zuckerberg shared, but Jobs reportedly told his biographer Walter Isaacson: ""We talk about social networks in the plural, but I don't see anybody other than Facebook out there. Just Facebook, They are dominating this. I admire Mark Zuckerberg ... for not selling out, for wanting to make a company. I admire that a lot."" When Jobs died last October, Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page, ""Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you."" Jon Burgstone, professor at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that Zuckerberg will need to keep his perspective and continue developing. ""He has already become one of the world's most famous people, and also the richest,"" he says. ""He walks into a room and you can feel people's excitement and the rush to be near him. He's already had time to learn how to deal with such fame and fortune, but now it's advancing to an entirely new level. How will he handle it, emotionally and professionally?"" Lieb marvels at the life Zuckerberg has led so far. Imagine being in your 20s, a self-made billionaire, your life the subject of a Hollywood movie, 2010's ""The Social Network."" ""It's a lifetime and the guy isn't 30 yet,"" Lieb says. He's made big mistakes, especially with regard to users' privacy. One example is Beacon, Facebook's misguided advertising product that broadcast user's activities on outside websites without their explicit consent. Still, he took steps to correct them. On blog posts about Facebook's privacy blunders, he's admitted the company has made mistakes. His 2007 post about Beacon showed his straightforward, methodical thinking: ""We've made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we've made even more with how we've handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. While I am disappointed with our mistakes, we appreciate all the feedback we have received from our users. I'd like to discuss what we have learned and how we have improved Beacon,"" he wrote five years ago. Facebook shut down Beacon two years later. Zuckerberg has done well for himself so far, but he'll be pulled in many directions once Facebook is public. ""There is going to be a tremendous amount of scrutiny on this company,"" Lieb says. ""Who really is qualified"" to carry such a weight? ____ Follow Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at http://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay Stocks slammed!

"Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mark-zuckerberg-might-too-170039566.html Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful - Yahoo Finance Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful May 9, 2012 4:55 PM In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn from. [ Photos: Occupy Wall Street: Fighting or Floundering? ] Of course, we'd all avoid failure if we could. But setbacks happen to just about everybody, and they often turn out to be the most instructive experiences we ever go through. ""Ask one hundred people, 'What have you learned from success?' and most of them will just look at you,"" former Coca-Cola president Don Keough told me while I was researching my book Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success . ""But ask, 'What have you learned from failure?' and you'll get lots of answers."" Setbacks usually don't feel so illuminating when they're happening, and some people don't even like to admit when something goes wrong. But just about every business involves some kind of risk, which makes flops and failures inevitable. That's especially true in Silicon Valley, where investors routinely take big risks on startups. As a rule of thumb, about 40 percent of startups funded by venture capitalists fail, 40 percent are successful enough to return their initial investment, and only 20 percent turn out to be good investments that return a healthy profit. And only a fraction of those enjoy the staggering success that Facebook is poised to enjoy in its huge public offering. With a high risk of failure, venture capitalists don't worry so much about preventing it. Instead, they try to spot failures early, so that resources aren't wasted beyond the point of no return. They also intently study failures in order to make sure there's no missed opportunity or new direction that might be more productive. As many investors know, for example, Viagra was initially developed as a hypertension drug that didn't pan out. Only by accident did researchers notice that it seemed to enhance the sexual potency of male rabbits, leading to its development as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. [ See 6 reasons America will rebound .] Savvy investors also value failure as an essential ingredient in the seasoning needed to develop capable business leaders. ""When considering investing in a company, I always ask a CEO, 'Tell me about your failures,'"" says one prominent venture capitalist. ""If you haven't had a failure, you don't have your strength. Somebody who has only experienced success is likely to be so convinced they're brilliant that it never occurs to them they might just be lucky."" Mark Zuckerberg is probably both brilliant and lucky. He's clearly a visionary who figured out new ways to use technology to connect people. He's also lucky he became a programmer just as the Internet became the backbone of mass communication. Talent and luck can be a pretty awesome combination, so it's no surprise Zuckerberg is already a technology titan and billionaire before his 30th birthday. But he may also be a massive case of hubris in the making. Zuckerberg has structured Facebook so that he'll retain an extraordinary degree of control, even after five percent of the shares go public. He negotiated the recent $1 billion acquisition of Instagram almost entirely on his own, over a weekend, with minimal input from his board or other senior executives. Facebook's registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission even states that Zuckerberg and his family and friends can fly on company-financed planes, for personal use, with the cost accounted for as Zuckerberg's ""other compensation."" It's hard to think of another sizeable company so dominated by one person, especially one so untouched by marketplace ups and downs. [ See why Apple could get even bigger .] If Zuckerberg's meteoric success convinces him that he's infallible, Facebook will be in trouble. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers seems to have developed a sense of invulnerability, which prevented him from spotting what was really wrong with his firm--and possibly saving it--before it went bankrupt. Rupert Murdoch's sense of omnipotence may have led him to believe his company, News Corp., could break the law and get away with it. Yet the phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's British papers has damaged the entire company. Many other corporate titans fumbled because they became too convinced that they could do no wrong. Setbacks leaven that type of arrogance. When I was researching , Tim Westergren, the founder of Internet radio company Pandora, told me about the difficulties he faced in two prior careers before he got the idea for Pandora, and the several near-death experiences Pandora had while he was trying to get it off the ground. Those challenges gave Westergren the opportunity to use and build his talents, but they also revealed the limits of his abilities. ""I'm in the church of humility,"" he told me. ""If you're humble, you don't get caught up in the trappings of success, which can be very corrupting for most people. You can get drunk on that if you're not humble."" We now get to see whether Mark Zuckerberg can beat the odds, and stay sober-minded in spite of his gargantuan success.

December 30, 2013 2:34 PM Why Twitter is like the cronut—in demand, but hyped and overvalued (Part 1 of 5) One of the buzziest topics in the investing world lately has been Twitter (TWTR). The social media company was one of the most sought-after IPOs of the year as the stock popped to $44.90 per share on its first trading day, after the IPO priced at $26 per share. Since then, the stock has had a strong rally and closed on December 20, 2013, at $63.75 per share, resulting in a market cap of over $36 billion. However, the market’s perception of Twitter’s valuation is far beyond the company’s fundamental valuation. We’re not saying the stock will decline in price, but we can say that where it’s priced is probably not what it’s worth, and that relative to its comps, Twitter is probably too expensive.

(NYSE: JKS) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/secondary-offerings-jinkosolar-shutterstock-send-161000001.html Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher - Yahoo Finance Secondary Offerings at JinkoSolar, Shutterstock Send Shares Higher September 20, 2013 12:10 PM It is not often that a secondary stock offering sends a company’s shares higher, but we are seeing that very phenomenon Friday morning. Chinese solar PV maker JinkoSolar Holding Co. Ltd. ( JKS ) and stock image company Shutterstock Inc. ( SSTK ) both priced secondary offerings this morning and shares in both companies have risen sharply. At JinkoSolar, shares priced at $16.25, after closing Thursday night at $16.48, and shortly before noon the stock was up by 13.8% at $18.75. The company offered 3.8 million shares and an underwriters’ option on an additional 570,000. JinkoSolar says it will use proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include expanding its manufacturing capacity. That by itself should have sent shares down. ALSO READ: Famous Restaurant Chains That Are Hard to Find Shutterstock closed last night at $60.32 and priced its offering of 4.6 million shares at $60.00 this morning. The company is selling only 1 million shares; the rest are being sold by some existing shareholders. The underwriters have an option on an additional 690,000 shares. The company said the purpose behind the offering is to increase the company’s public float, among other things. As far as JinkoSolar is concerned, part of the reason for the price jump is almost certainly a short squeeze. Institutional investors also are likely the heaviest buyers as they move toward some momentum stocks to juice up returns. ALSO READ: The Countries with the Most Multimillionaires Shutterstock only had a public float of about 6.5 million shares, so it is likely adding liquidity. The stock is up more than 200% since the company’s IPO, and we can assume that there are real buyers out there who want in on the party. In addition, nearly 13% of the stock is held short, so there is some covering going on as well. Still, it is an interesting turn of events to see shares jump on secondary offerings. Shares of JinkoSolar are trading at $18.43 a few minutes after noon on Friday, in a 52-week range of $3.18 to $20.06. Shutterstock’s shares are up nearly 12% at $67.46, after posting a new 52-week high earlier this morning of $68.42. The 52-week low is the IPO price of $21.00.

We are seeing major ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-raising-over-3-billion-140056268.html Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales - Yahoo Finance Companies Raising Over $3 Billion in New Stock Sales September 10, 2013 10:00 AM The stock market is looking healthier and healthier again, and it is not just because the S&P 500 is within striking distance of 1,700 and because the DJIA has crossed back over 15,000. We are seeing major secondary offerings from companies themselves and from their insiders and backers. When companies sell shares it is generally into a strong market. That being said, investors have to sometimes wonder if they want to buy stock when a company wants to sell more stock to the public. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked offerings from and involving the following companies: Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ); Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ), Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ), Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ), Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ), Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ), Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) and Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ). Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2014 What should really stand out here is not just that these combined offerings come to more than $2.4 billion. We did not include several other offerings, and those in total would come up to close to another $1 billion. We have added color and reference on each offering versus its average volume and size. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ( AWI ) has an offering of 10,057,382 common shares held by Armstrong World Industries, Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust and Armor TPG Holdings. Note that the company has agreed to purchase 5,057,382 of the 10,057,382 common shares of this offering at a price per share equal to the price paid by the underwriter. Shares are trading at $52.37, and the 52-week trading range is $43.30 to $58.48. This is some $520 million in gross dollars, or about $250 million if you back out the shares being repurchased. Seven Highly Educated Jobs Making the Least Money Enbridge Energy Management LLC ( EEQ ) has filed to sell 8 million of its listed shares (units). Proceeds will be used to invest in an equal number of i-units of Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. ( EEP ). Enbridge Partners will then use the proceeds to purchase additional shares to repay its commercial paper, to finance a portion of its capital expansion program and for general partnership purposes. The ""Management-EEQ"" units are down 4% at $28.67, against a 52-week range of $25.81 to $32.30. The ""Partners-EEP"" shares closed at $30.20, versus a 52-week range of $26.88 to $33.49. This comes to almost $240 million before the exercise of any overallotment shares (units). Inergy Midstream L.P. ( NRGM ) is trading down by 4.6%, at $22.19 against a 52-week range of $21.03 to $26.01, after filing to sell 11 million common units. The gross proceeds appear to be around $242 million or so. Be advised that the units are being sold by its limited partners. Marketo Inc. ( MKTO ) already has filed to sell 6 million shares of its common stock, with 5.3 million being sold by existing shareholders and Marketo offering about 700,000 shares in the offering. This offering may seem small at about $200 million, but this is right into a lock-up period since its IPO came out in May. Many investors find offerings in bad taste on a ""Sell as immediately as you can,"" but this one did very well since its IPO as well. Starwood Property Trust Inc. ( STWD ) has priced a 25 million share offering of common stock to raise just over $600 million in gross proceeds. The company intends to use the net proceeds to originate and purchase additional commercial mortgage loans and other target assets and investments, and it included the ""for other general corporate purposes"" disclaimer in the release. The $600 million compares to a market cap of about $4.04 billion, while the 25 million shares compares to an average daily volume of about 2 million shares. Apple: What Happens When Everyone Knows About a Product Release? Stratasys Ltd. ( SSYS ) is selling 4 million shares of its ordinary shares, representing close to $400 million in gross proceeds. Its market cap is just over $4 billion, and it trades about 825,000 shares per day on average. Virtus Investment Partners Inc. ( VRTS ) has done incredibly well as a stock, and it has now filed to sell roughly $175 million worth of its common stock. That would be roughly 1 million shares based on the current price, versus an average daily volume of only about 50,000 shares. Virtus has a market cap of $1.37 billion before the impact of this offering. These were just the offerings that we deemed to be of significant value. There were seven or eight other offerings that probably come close to another $1 billion or so in combined size. As a reminder, when companies and insiders sell more stock, those funds to purchase the new shares on the market generally are used in place of what would have otherwise been market-oriented stocks.

"We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen Don't expect a game changing tech IPO anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-living-tech-depression-andreessen-100130066.html We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen - Yahoo Finance We're Living in a 'Tech Depression': Andreessen May 14, 2013 6:01 AM Don't expect a game changing tech initial public offering anytime soon. Private tech companies are steering clear of going public as long as they can manage, said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday. ""When you say what's the next big IPO, the brutal truth is I don't know and I'm not sure there is going to be one for quite while because the incentives are so strong to keep these companies private,"" Andreessen said. : Software Out, Hardware Start-Ups In ) The hangover felt from the dot-com crash and financial crisis has spurred an era of over regulation in the public markets which has essentially caused a backlash from private companies that are refusing to go public, Andreessen said. Emerging entrepreneurs see the public markets as ""incredibly hostile,"" he said. ""The new running theory among new entrepreneurs is never take your company public or don't do it as long as you possibly can,"" Andreessen said. Andreessen, who has invested in tech companies including, Facebook ( FB ), Twitter, and Pinterest, said that another reason tech companies are hesitant to go public is because of the pain still felt from the dot-com crash. : Facebook in Talks to Buy Israel's Waze: Report ) ""A lot of people got burned during the dot-com crash, so I think we are living through the other side of that, I think we are living through sort of the tech depression, is the term I've used,"" he said. ""But at the same time I can tell you that the vast majority of the interesting new companies that are sort of at the $50 million to $100 million revenue stage,that have historically have been the source of the exciting IPOs that put growth into the market, those companies are quite simply staying private, they aren't going public."" : Signs of Another Tech Bubble: VC ) While there were about 8,800 public companies in 1997, there were about 4,100 publicly traded companies in 2012, a decline that can be contributed to a war being waged on the public markets via regulations like Sarbanes-Oaxley and Regulation FD, which were put in place to help derisk the market. But these regulations do more harm than good, Andreessen said. (Read More Below the Video.) ""We seem to have collectively decided as a society that we want to strip risks out of the public markets, so we had the dot-com crash, we had the financial crisis, and we decided that we don't like risk anymore,"" he said. ""So there have been a series of regulatory reforms, a series of corporate governance movements, and the result has been a huge disincentive for companies to go public, and of course the problem with that is if new companies don't go public then you get exactly what we are seeing, which is the number of public companies falling."" Because the number of public companies is falling, growth is being stripped out of the public markets, which will ultimately pave the way for a two-tiered system, he said. ""If you kill risk, you kill growth. If you kill growth you kill returns. And as a result the market is becoming a two-tiered system and I think that is bad,"" he said. ""Funds like ours-that primarily represent, frankly, rich people, rich people's pensions, rich people's colleges and foreign countries' sovereign wealth funds-generally, are doing fine."" However, he said that on the public side, growth is being drained out of the market, and that could hurt many Americans in the long-term. ""Of course the public market is where most ordinary Americans retirement savings is held in the form of mutual funds and pension funds and if we keep with this approach of over regulation in the public markets, we're not going to have returns for peoples' retirement accounts, which means people aren't going to be able to retire,"" he said. ""And I think that is going to be the big problem that comes out of that and I think that's where we are heading straight towards that right now.""

At its peak, the stock traded at nearly $600, versus around $500 now. With earnings expected after the close Thursday, investors will be looking for any sign that the mounting controversy and legal issues over the injuries and deaths allegedly related to da Vinci procedures are affecting the company's growth. (Read More Below the Video.) : What Happens When the Surgical Robot Malfunctions? ) Over the past two quarters, growth in sales and profits slowed considerably, but it is still robust by most standards, with sales in the fourth quarter leaping 23 percent. Driving gains has been growing use of the da Vinci for hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures. Forecasts for this quarter are for earnings per share of 43 cents on revenue of $282 million. But as more reports of complications have come to light, the da Vinci debate is heating up. In late February, the FDA launched a probe calling for voluntary information from hospitals and surgeons using the da Vinci, in an effort to determine ""if the rise in reports may be a true reflection of problems."" Speaking at an investor meeting in early March, the company said, ""The relationship we have with the FDA has been a long and very strong relationship."" In mid-March the American Congress of Obstetricians and and Gynecologists issued a statement, warning that ""studies show there is a learning curve with new surgical technologies, during which there is an increased complication rate."" Robotic Surgery: Growing Sales, but Growing Concerns ) And five days later, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine weighed in with an advisory citing an ""increasing number of reports of patient complications associated with robot-assisted surgery."" In a statement to CNBC, Intuitive said: ""In any definitive treatment for complex disease, such as surgery of the cancerous prostate, heart, or other major organs there are risks of complications. Robotic surgery has proven benefits in reducing the risk and complications associated with open surgical procedures thereby extending the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to a broader population of patients. Overall, adverse event rates are very low. Da Vinci surgery has been shown to be safer than the open surgery alternatives in numerous independent large scale, peer reviewed studies.""

"A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-week-ipos-more-coming-142923777.html A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming - Yahoo Finance A Big Week for IPOs, and More Are Coming April 12, 2013 10:29 AM Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange, April 11, 2013. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid It's a big week for initial public offerings, and more are coming. Finally, it looks like IPOs are starting to catch up with the market. This was a big week for IPOs, in terms of number and how well most of them did. Six companies went public this week, and about $1.5 billion was raised. Four of the six increased the number of shares offered, or priced above the expected range, or both. That is bullish. You don't see this type of activity in a bear market. For the first quarter about $7.8 billion was raised, according to John Fitzgibbon at IPO Scoop. That is much better than the first quarter of 2012, when $5.9 billion was raised. The IPO market is a follower, not a leader ... but it's catching up. And there are more coming. Seven IPOs are on tap for next week, looking to raise $1.9 billion. Another big one was just announced: HD Supply Holdings (12 percent owned by Home Depot) filed for a large ($1 billion) IPO. The company went private for $8.5 billion in 2007. (More From CNBC: Cramer Says Wells Fargo Missed a 'Great Mortgage Moment' ) Two IPOs priced overnight: Payment processing company Evertec (to be traded under the symbol ""EVTC"") priced 25.3 million shares at $20, the high end of the price range of $18 to $20 a share, while Rally Software (""RALY"") priced 6 million shares $14. That is above the initial share count of 5.75 million and above the price talk of $11 to $13 a share. Rally provides cloud-based systems for Agile software development projects, which is a methodology for best practices in developing software. 1) JPMorgan Chase: Poke all the holes you want. It continues to hit the numbers, and it's got a ton of money. The usual pundits are coming on, complaining about ""earnings quality."" They do this every quarter. You can say it's making its numbers because it is releasing reserves, you can say it's because it is cutting costs, but still. JPMorgan is making its numbers. Yes, low rates hurt margins, but we've seen that for three years and guys are still finding ways to make money. It is also planning to raise its dividend...it now has a 3.2 percent dividend yield, and is continuing to buy back stock. (More From CNBC: 5 Fiscal Secrets Buried Deep in Obama's Budget ) JPMorgan current earnings estimate for 2013 is about $5.50 a share; it could do $6 a share. That's 8.3 times earnings, with a 3.2 percent dividend. That's not awful. JPMorgan has something like $21 billion in reserves it can release. It can buy back stock, increase its dividend, and still get to 9 percent Tier One capital. And if there is any hint that rates are going to go up, this company will explode. 2) Everyone's getting bearish! What's up with sentiment? Lots of talk last night about the huge plunge in bullish sentiment for the weekly AAII Investor Sentiment Survey. Bullish sentiment is at 19.3 percent for the week ending April 10, down 16.2 points from the prior week, the lowest level since March 5, 2009. Wow. The historic average is 39 percent. Bearish sentiment went to 54.5 percent, up 26.3 points from the prior week, the highest pessimism level since July 8, 2010. Some are noting that there was an unusually low level of respondents this week ... maybe the bears are just more motivated! 3) Finally, a downgrade of two big consumer names. It's been quite a ride for big consumer names this year. Coca-Cola has gone from $36 to $41 a share, PepsiCo has gone from $68 to $80 a share this year and is at an historic high. Today Davenport downgraded both to ""neutral"" on valuation, but also noted that for Coca-Cola was likely ""weaker than expected."" It certainly is a bit of a mystery why these stocks have been flying: Coke had only 1 percent volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is trading at roughly 19 times forward earnings. Pepsi is trading at 18 times forward earnings. 3) Gold collapses, breaking to near 12-month lows.

"Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut Two IPOs hit the market today ¡ndash; with two very different first-day performances. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/model-n-tetraphase-ipos-debut-205808421.html Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut - Yahoo Finance Model N, Tetraphase IPOs Debut March 20, 2013 4:58 PM Two IPOs hit the market today – with two very different first-day performances. Model N ( MODN ) , a provider of revenue management software to the life science and technology sectors, was up 28% in its debut despite pricing above its expected range. The stock went public at $15.50 a share, ahead of its predicted $12.50-$14.50 range. But that didn’t stop it from rising all the way to $19.84 on Wednesday. Tetraphase Pharmaceutical’s ( TTPH ) IPO wasn’t quite as effective. A developer of antibiotics that treat serious abdominal and urinary tract infections, Tetraphase shares priced at $7 a share – well below the $10 to $12 range listed in the company’s original IPO filing. The stock didn’t budge from there, finishing at exactly $7 after rising as high as $7.50. Six more companies are scheduled to go public in the coming days, including another pharmaceutical company called Enanta. Tetraphase’s first-day struggles likely have Enanta officials a bit more apprehensive about their company’s IPO. On the flip side, Marin Software is surely encouraged by Model N’s smashing debut. That should embolden the San Francisco-based cloud-computing company ahead of its IPO, which could come by week’s end. Model N and Tetraphase were just the fourth and fifth companies to go public this month. More From Wyatt Investment Research Fed Meeting By the Numbers How is March Madness Useful in Investing?

And there are several reasons why 360buy should in fact wait even longer. While  IPO rumors have come and gone , the latest reason for the speculation is the  similar chatter about Alibaba Group , China’s largest e-commerce company and 360buy’s biggest rival. (Alibaba’s TMall is thought to have some 45% of the business-to-consumer (B2C) market share , compared with 360buy’s 17%.) Some say an imminent Alibaba listing puts pressure on 360buy  to move first in order to beat Alibaba to the punch. But investors in an IPO will ask whether 360buy can make a real profit, and some analysts doubt it.  360buy follows an Amazon model when it comes to logistics and, as a result, it is burning through cash to expand its capacity in deliveries, warehousing and inventory. Furthermore, many of its products are low-margin electronic goods. That pits it against Suning Appliance, a brick-and-mortar retailer listed in Shanghai which is breaking into e-commerce, and is planning to  spend $3.5 billion on ramping up . Alibaba follows a different model—one that’s high-margin and low-cost. That means apple-to-apple comparisons with 360buy aren’t entirely appropriate. Alibaba’s TMall is a collection of thousands of virtual stores for brands like Prada, Gucci, Gap and, as of yesterday, Microsoft . Those stores handle the deliveries, which means Alibaba doesn’t rack up high capital costs; the company doubled its net income to $273 million in the second quarter of last year. As a result, for Alibaba an IPO is logical for funding its growth. The company may go public in the fourth quarter this year, though no decisions have been made, according to sources. Where 360buy sees TMall’s Achilles heel, the source told Quartz, is in logistics. TMall doesn’t handle deliveries, so it’s unusually vulnerable to bottlenecks in China’s backward parcel delivery system. It recently formed a coalition with delivery and real estate companies to help get around this. 360buy wants to invest in warehousing and logistics to give itself a competitive edge, the source said. Last month 360buy raked in $700 million in its latest fundraising round—enough cash to make the final push toward profitability and making a public listing a medium-term goal, the industry source said. CEO Richard Liu said he expects to be  profitable only in 2014  (link in Chinese), though the source said that could happen as soon as the end of 2013. But most of that $700 million will go into building up its logistics, putting further pressure on its already low-margin business and making an IPO premature.  Another sign that it’s too early for 360buy to consider listing is that valuation estimates have been in flux, when they normally go steadily up for a company in pre-public mode. All this suggests 360buy isn’t ready to start unveiling its financials, much less go on a road show to pitch the company. If it sells itself too early to investors, it risks having its IPO become a flop. Even if Alibaba beats it to going public, 360buy is better off waiting to solidify its business first.

The company had waited a long time before going public (it filed its initial paperwork in 2011) and ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/silver-spring-ipo-showed-mix-203114458.html Silver Spring’s IPO showed the right mix of art and science - Yahoo Finance Silver Spring’s IPO showed the right mix of art and science March 14, 2013 4:31 PM Smart power grid company Silver Spring Networks had some doubters before its IPO debuted on March 13. The company had waited a long time before going public (it filed its initial paperwork in 2011) and green tech stocks haven’t been embraced by the market. But when the IPO finally came,  the stock jumped by almost 30% after its debut, showing a successful IPO is just as much about art as it is science. The IPO market has been rife with cautionary tales lately, leading some to question the mechanisms used to price and assess demand. Some like Facebook  seem overpriced and then drop in the market after going public, while others like LinkedIn jump so much that underwriters are accused of underpricing the IPO. The New York Times recently argued that Goldman Sachs severely underpriced  the 1999 eToys IPO —though others argued it was overpriced given the fundamentals of eToys, which later went out of business. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula for setting an IPO. The science—the numbers for revenue, customers and profitability—is important, helping establish an IPO’s timing and the share price range. But then comes the art, which is in the form of the IPO road show. This is when the company and its underwriters tell their story, in addition to assessing investor appetite and concerns. Facebook did a bad job of both. During the road show, some investors expressed concerns about the company’s future growth, especially because Facebook released some negative information about its mobile advertising during that time. Instead of taking investors’ worries as a hint to be more conservative on the IPO, Facebook and its lead underwriter went the other way. For Silver Spring, the company and its underwriters, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, knew they had to explain to investors why they waited so long to go public, according to sources. But they also talked about the company’s growth prospects, including in places like South America and Asia, and other promising data, the sources said. And they made the pitch to the kinds of investors who understand Silver Spring’s niche business. Silver Spring also wanted the stock to go up by a reasonable amount after it debuted, sources added; this “pop” has psychological value. So the pricing was relatively conservative. But after getting signs of interest from investors, Silver Spring increased the quantity of shares it would sell, albeit not by too much; and it didn’t alter the $17 price. It remains to be seen whether Silver Spring can sustain its IPO bump. But it was trading just above $22 in its second day on the market. And an IPO that had its naysayers is now being seen as a positive sign for  investors in green energy technology, and in the tech market in general.

According to the territory’s South China Morning Post, China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group, is discussing Nasdaq (paywall) as the venue for its long-awaited listing. An IPO could value Alibaba at  more than $40 billion , making it potentially the biggest tech IPO in history . If the company chooses a US listing, that would be a further blow to the Chinese territory, where the value of IPOs on the stock exchange plummeted to a four year low last year as mainland China’s economic slowdown made investors less interested in allocating cash there. Chinese internet firms have a long record of choosing the Nasdaq over Hong Kong, mainly because they tend to be fast-growing but also young and loss-making.  The Hong Kong stock exchange requires companies conducting IPOs to have earned a profit for three years before going public. But Alibaba  is profitable  (its part-owner Yahoo discloses its finances).  So it would not be forced to choose a US exchange over Hong Kong in the way that Chinese  social networking business Renren , for example, had to. However, it would be not be unusual if Alibaba were meeting with banks and stock exchange representatives in Hong Kong and New York to see where it would get the best valuation for its shares. Investment bankers in both cities have been crowding around the company and trying to get hired on the IPO. It was reported  (paywall) last month that Alibaba executives were set to meet potential advisers to discuss a Hong Kong listing. Alibaba Group includes Alibaba.com, an online marketplace connecting Chinese manufacturers with overseas buyers, and auction site Taobao. Alibaba.com was previously listed on the Hong Kong exchange. It was taken private by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma last year in a move widely viewed as a precursor to an IPO of his entire business. An Alibaba Group spokesman declined to comment.

"Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles Professional Diversity Network¡rsquo;s (NASDAQ: IPDN) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/professional-diversity-network-ipo-struggles-195953813.html Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles - Yahoo Finance Professional Diversity Network IPO Struggles March 6, 2013 2:59 PM Professional Diversity Network’s ( IPDN ) IPO fell flat in its market debut yesterday, getting the March initial public offerings market off to an inauspicious start. The first stock to go public on a U.S. market in nearly three weeks, the Professional Diversity Network IPO declined 4% in its first day of trading and is down another 5.6% today. That doesn’t bode well for the provider of online networking and job opportunities for minorities, which went public below its expected range at $8 a share. It was also a lukewarm kickoff for the March IPO market on the heels of a busy first two months of 2013 . Twelve companies went public in January – the most since 2006. February brought another eight IPOs – less than the last two Februarys, but more than the previous three. The returns have been even better. Year-to-date, the 21 companies that have gone public have returned an average of more than 15%. Only five of them have actually fallen since their debuts – another bad sign for Professional Diversity Network. Up next on the IPO schedule are Artisan Partners Asset Management , a Wisconsin-based investment management business, and Silver Spring Networks , which provides smart grid products and services. According to IPO web site Renaissance Capital, no other public offerings are in the hopper – which could bode for a slower March than in recent years.

And a common point analysts raised just before its 2011 IPO was that Glencore’s majority shareholders may be selling out because they predicted the world resources “supercycle,” as commodities bulls used to call it, was about to be punctured. Glencore’s 2o12 earnings, released today, will have its IPO cynics chuckling at the prescience of their foresight. Last year, Glencore’s net income  crashed 75% . That was partly because of a decline in the value of Glencore’s stake in Russian aluminum producer Rusal, but generally because its sales prices declined as  China’s growth slowed . While the London and Hong Kong flotation  made billionaires of Glencore’s bosses, it’s not at all provable that CEO Ivan Glasenberg saw into the future with mystic accuracy before selling part of his company to outsiders. Maybe he just wanted to spread the fruits of his company’s success more widely and was as surprised by the supercycle accident as many others in the resources industry  (paywall). Still, the IPO timing looks brilliant for those who swapped large stakes in the business for cash. Here is what has happened to Glencore’s London share price (blue line) since its stockmarket debut and with the overall performance of the FTSE 100 (yellow line) provided for reference. Ouch.

Analysts interpreted the unusually high trading volume as a clear sign that at least a few of the insiders were seizing on a fresh selling opportunity. That is stirring a debate over whether they're simply locking in long-awaited gains on investments made many years ago or bailing out of a company that has lost its luster. A breakdown on just how many major Facebook Inc. shareholders sold their stock probably won't be available until next week at the earliest. Securities regulations give them at least three business days before they have to disclose such transactions. The information is important ""because if you are an investor who has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy the stock, you might decide to stay on the sidelines for a little longer after seeing which insiders decided to sell their stock,"" CapStone Investments analyst Rory Maher said. All told, investors who owned a combined 271 million Facebook shares could have sold their holdings Thursday with the expiration of a ban known as a lock-up period. The restrictions were imposed on a group of venture capitalists, companies and Silicon Valley cognoscente who invested in Facebook during its formative years and sold some of their holdings three months ago when the company went public at $38. The highly anticipated IPO had valued the company at $104 billion, similar to those of Amazon.com Inc. and PepsiCo Inc. The shares have plunged by nearly 50 percent since then amid concerns about whether Facebook is destined to become a passing fancy and worries about whether it will be able to sell more advertising on mobile devices as users gravitate there. Facebook' stock traded as low as $19.69 before bouncing back slightly. The shares closed Thursday at $19.87, down $1.33, or more than 6 percent. The previous low during the day was $19.82 and the previous low for a close was $20.04, both reached Aug. 2 More than 156 million shares were traded, more than five times the stock's average volume over the past month. Trading in the overall market was lighter than usual. The Facebook investors eligible to sell their shares Thursday included venture capital firms Accel Partners and Greylock Partners; investment banker Goldman Sachs Group; software maker Microsoft Corp.; Zynga Inc. CEO Marc Pincus; LinkedIn Corp. Chairman Reid Hoffman; and former PayPal CEO Peter Thiel. If there was mass selling within this group, Facebook's stock could decline further because the market would be flooded with nearly two-thirds more shares. Given that most of these investors put their money into Facebook five to eight years ago, they probably were eager to sell, said Sam Hamadeh, the CEO of PrivCo, a research firm that follows privately held companies. ""A lot of people have been waiting,"" he said. ""Facebook was expected to go public a long time ago."" Despite the sharp drop in Facebook's market value during the past three months, the early investors can still reap huge windfalls by selling at the current price. For instance, Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, the year CEO Mark Zuckerberg began the site in a Harvard dorm room. After selling 16.8 million shares for $640 million at the time of the initial public offering in May, Thiel still owned nearly 28 million shares worth about $560 million at Thursday's trading prices. Accel Partners invested $12.7 million in Facebook in 2005. The firm sold nearly 58 million shares for $2.2 billion as part of Facebook's IPO and still owned nearly 144 million shares worth about $2.9 billion. It wasn't known how many of those shares could have been sold Thursday, and whether any of them were. Because those investors had put up little compared with the shares' value today, ""you can understand why they would want to take some of their money off the table now,"" Maher said. ""But at the same time, you have to wonder if they're thinking that Facebook isn't much of a bargain anymore."" Hamadeh believes the venture capitalists who invested in Facebook realize it's a ""fool's game"" to wait for a better price on the stock. On the flip side, other key investors seem unlikely to sell additional shares right away. Microsoft, which invested $240 million in Facebook in 2007, relies on Facebook's social network to help bring more traffic to its Bing search engine, making it less likely that it would risk antagonizing Facebook executives by bailing out. The software company also doesn't need the money, as it is already is sitting on $63 billion in cash. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment Thursday. The selling shackles will come off of an additional 1.66 billion locked-up Facebook shares during the next nine months to place more potential pressure on the stock. One of the biggest tests will come in November when about 1.2 billion insider shares will be eligible for sale. The freed-up shares will include those owned by Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO and founder who sold 30 million shares for $1.1 billion in the May IPO to cover his taxes. Other Internet companies that have gone public in the past year have been hit hard by the expiration of their lock-up periods. On Tuesday, shares of online reviews service Angie's List suffered their biggest one-day drop so far and closed at a new low following the expiration of a similar ban. The price dropped, even though there was no word on whether any of the major investors had dumped their shares. LinkedIn, which runs a professional networking version of Facebook, also took a big hit when restrictions on insider selling lifted last November. Its shares sank to their trading low of $55.98 after the lock-up period expired, but have since rebounded strongly. The shares closed at $103.99 Thursday, more than twice its IPO price of $45. It appears some investors believe Facebook's stock price is nearing its low point, at least until the next lock-up periods end this fall. Short sellers, a type of investor that bets certain stocks will fall, had been intensifying their focus on Facebook since the company's July 26 report of disappointing revenue growth during the second quarter. To wager against a company, short sellers must borrow the stock of other investors and then make money by paying back the shares at a lower price. The amount of borrowed Facebook shares had spiked from about 70 million before Facebook's second-quarter earnings report to about 92 million at the end of Thursday's trading, said Tim Smith, senior vice president of SunGard Astecs Analytics, which tracks short-selling activity. But sentiments started to shift Thursday as the volume of shares being returned to the lenders outstripped the number being borrowed, Smith said. The cost to borrow Facebook shares also has been declining, a sign that short-selling demand is waning. ""Facebook's stock might be finally bumping along its bottom,"" Smith said. Considering the heavy trading volume, Facebook's stock would have fallen more dramatically if buyers hadn't stepped in, said Louise Yamada, a technical analyst who runs her own research firm. She suspects Facebook insiders are being careful not to flood the market with stock. ""They're smart enough to know if they sell at the same time, the stock would fall,"" Yamada said. It has been a rough run for Facebook. After one of the most-anticipated IPOs in history, Facebook had perhaps the most-botched stock market debut as glitches marred its first day of trading. Things have gotten progressively worse as Facebook's market value has plunged by about $49 billion. The downfall stems from doubts about Facebook's ability to fend off intensifying competition from Internet search leader Google Inc. while trying to develop a plan for increasing the amount of revenue that it brings in from a worldwide audience of 955 million users. The uncertainty means Facebook's stock is likely to be volatile until the end of the year when the majority of the lockups expire. Hamadeh views the end of those selling constraints as a ""dark cloud on the horizon."" ""There is no way around it. It'll be painful,"" he said. ""But hopefully once that selling pressure is gone, it will find its floor and could be a basis for a more stable stock through 2013."" __ AP Business Writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this story.

"The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price He also predicted how Facebook would IPO. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/valuation-guru-nailed-apple-reveals-144217092.html The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price - Yahoo Finance The Valuation Guru Who Nailed Apple Reveals Facebook's Fair Price May 23, 2012 10:42 AM Aswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary finance professor, has made two monster calls in recent weeks: 1) He sold Apple near the top after holding it for 15 years. 2) He said Facebook would be a "" Goldilocks IPO ""—not too hot, not too cold. That latter call may still be up for debate.  But the bottom line is that it neither surged, nor totally collapsed. In a new guest post on Forbes.com , Damodaran offers a valuation for Facebook: .  That gives the social network a market capitalization of about $70 billion. ""Yes, Facebook can be valued,"" he wrote. Here are the assumptions and caveats he employs in his valuation model: : ""...If the company can maintain a compounded revenue growth of 40% for the next 5 years , with growth rates scaling down after that towards the growth rate of the economy, the firm will have revenues of $44 billion in ten years, which would put it on the same growth path as Google in its first years as a public company."" : ""...If Facebook is able to maintain a (close to Apple’s, and higher than Google’s) as a mature company, it would be pulling off a very difficult feat."" : ""As Facebook’s revenue grows, it will find itself under pressure to pay more for this growth ..."" : ""There is significant risk in the company. In valuing the company,  we use a cost of capital of 11.42% , which would put Facebook in the top quartile of publicly traded U.S. firms in terms of risk."" Damodaran, being a value investor isn't ready to buy. ""With its user base, Facebook has the ingredients to generate sizable profits down the road, albeit with substantial risks along the way,"" he wrote.  ""At the right price, I would buy the company, notwithstanding the uncertainty about the future. At the IPO offering price or even at the price at which it is trading at right now, I would not."" Read the whole post at Forbes.com .

A few thoughts: IPOs can be hit or miss. On the ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/lessons-facebook-ipo-130719545.html Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO - Yahoo Finance Some Lessons From the Facebook IPO May 23, 2012 9:07 AM I have no idea whether Facebook stock will ultimately pan out to be a solid investment. In the short term, the stock is in the red following its IPO debut. A few thoughts: IPOs can be hit or miss. On the plus side, Google debuted in August of 2004 at $85 per share and currently trades at just over $602 per share, a handsome return for longer-term shareholders. The stock peaked at over $700 per share in late 2007 and fell to under $300 per share by late 2008 during the market meltdown. The other side of this coin, at least so far, is Groupon. The company's shares debuted in November of last year at $20 per share, hit a high of just over $31, and currently trade at just under $12 per share. The company's business model and accounting practices have come under question in recent months. Individual stocks can carry great rewards and great risks. I do not deal with individual stocks on behalf of my clients, with the exception of those clients who receive company stock as part of their compensation or those clients who brought individual stock holdings with them when they became clients. Asset allocation and risk control via mutual funds and ETFs works very well for my client base. That said, there is no combination of funds and ETFs that would have provided a return anywhere near what Apple stock has over the past decade plus. However, for every Apple or Google, there is a Microsoft or General Electric. The latter two companies' stock has basically been dead money for the past ten years. Both companies have failed to beat the anemic performance of the S&P 500 Index over the past decade. Microsoft was once itself a high flier. Its stock price broke $10 per share in 1996 and rose to over $58 during 1999. The stock has languished in the $20s for most of the period since 2000, with a few brief exceptions. Individual holdings can also be subject to event risk. An example of this was Union Carbide (now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical) after the disastrous chemical leak in Bhopal, India in 1984. The stock price dropped sharply in the wake of this tragedy. BP's stock was almost $78 per share in late 2007, but it fell to below $30 per share in the wake of the Gulf oil spill. The stock has recovered a bit and currently hovers near $40 per share, but this is still well off of its high. Many investors have no sell discipline. Finding a good price at which to buy an individual stock is much easier than determining when to sell it. Worse yet, I've seen too many investors who refuse to sell a stock in which they have a loss until they break even. Successful investors have sell discipline. Whether you invest in individual stocks and bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, or a combination of these, some basic investing principles should apply: --Invest with a goal in mind, ideally as part of your overall financial plan. -- Diversification is important. -- Control risk . --Rebalance periodically. --Review and monitor your individual holdings. While all of the hype over IPOs like Facebook's is interesting, it should be largely irrelevant to most investors. , CFP®, is a fee-only financial adviser at Asset Strategy Consultants based in Arlington Heights, Ill., where he provides advice to individual clients, retirement plan sponsors, foundations, and endowments.

But it has already set a strong example for entrepreneurs who want to build their companies into influential game-changers instead of taking a safer route--selling out to a competitor or a goliath. [ Photo gallery: A Look Back at Kodak. ] Even after it goes public and must, theoretically, answer to shareholders, Facebook and its 28-year-old CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, will retain an unusual level of autonomy. The public offering has been structured so that Zuckerberg himself will retain enough voting power to make unilateral decisions, if he chooses to--as he apparently did when single-handedly negotiating the recent $1 billion purchase of Instagram. Few company founders, if any, get such an influx of new capital while retaining so much control over their firms. That could end up being a risky business strategy, but for now, it's heartening to entrepreneurs eager to stick with their firms for the long haul. Since the recession hit in 2008, skittish lenders and weak financial markets have depressed the market for initial public offerings and forced many promising startups into the arms of healthier acquirers. Pure Digital, which made the popular Flip video camera, was acquired in 2009 by Cisco--which shut down the Flipcam operation just two years later. Personal-finance startup Mint.com was purchased by Intuit and rolled into its broader lineup of productivity offerings. Google bought Zagat and more than 50 lesser-known companies over the last three years, merging many of them into its existing platform of offerings. [ See why Mark Zuckerberg might be too successful. ] There's nothing wrong with selling your company to a corporate giant, especially if you're an entrepreneur who's eager to do something else or who simply wants the big payday. But acquired companies often lose their mission and sometimes their entire identity. Instead of growing into independent companies that hire people, build a following, and make an impact, they become indistinct parts of a corporate bureaucracy. Some analysts feel the trend toward ""flipping"" companies can erode the self-reinforcing culture of entrepreneurship in places like Silicon Valley, where startups often rely on the cultivation of others who have built their own firms into powerhouses. ""If you create a mercenary culture, it will kill the goose that laid the golden egg,"" says Andy Rachleff, a former venture capitalist who's now CEO of personal-finance startup Wealthfront.com. ""You solve little incremental things, but they don't make much of an impact on society."" Rachleff says entrepreneurs start new companies for three basic reasons: to make a lot of money, to build a great enterprise, or to change the world. Those goals aren't mutually exclusive, obviously, but Zuckerberg has made it clear that his primary intent with Facebook is to change the world (even if he gets rather rich in the process). [ See where the jobs are, and the college grads aren't. ] In an open letter contained in the official registration documents filed with the government, Zuckerberg stated that ""Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission--to make the world more open and connected."" He then went on to explain how its entire business strategy is built around that goal--whether shareholders like it or not. Other startup CEOs can only wish they had the standing to dictate terms to their investors, since lenders are firmly in the driver's seat these days. After peaking in 2007, the number of U.S. IPOs plunged in 2008 and 2009, according to consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers. The IPO market recovered somewhat in 2010, then fell back in 2011. This year, it's on a pace to eclipse last year's activity, but it's still about 30 percent below the pace of deals in 2007. ""It's starting to look normal,"" says Henri Leveque, a partner at PwC. ""We're seeing enough of these to feel good about people's confidence in capital markets."" If the Facebook offering goes well, it could generate more enthusiasm for other IPOs believed to be in the works, involving companies such as Airbnb, Dropbox, LivingSocial, Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter, and Workday. One thing many young firms have going for them these days: They've come of age in a tough economy, which means they're pretty durable. ""Recent IPOs have had solid management teams or sophisticated financial sponsorship,"" says Leveque. ""They're real companies."" Maybe some of them will even stick around for a while. ick Newman is the author of Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback to Success. Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.

By Barbara Ortutay, AP Technology Writer May 14, 2012 10:17 AM FILE - In this May, 26, 2010 file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the social network site's new privacy settings in Palo Alto, Calif. Zuckerberg and other executives addressed about 200 prospective investors Friday, May 10, 2012 at a hotel luncheon in Silicon Valley. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File) NEW YORK (AP) -- He famously wears a hoodie, jeans and sneakers, and he was born the year Apple introduced the Macintosh. But Mark Zuckerberg is no boy-CEO. Facebook's chief executive turned 28 on Monday, setting in motion the social network's biggest week ever. The company is expected to start selling stock to the public for the first time and begin trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on Friday. The IPO could value Facebook at nearly $100 billion, making it worth more than such iconic companies as Disney, Ford and Kraft Foods. At 28, Zuckerberg is exactly half the age of the average S&P 500 CEO, according to executive search firm Spencer Stuart. With eight years on the job, he's logged more time as leader than the average CEO, whose tenure is a little more than seven years, according to Spencer Stuart. Even so, the pressures of running a public company will undoubtedly take some getting used to. Once Facebook begins selling stock, Zuckerberg will be expected to please a host of new stakeholders, including Wall Street investment firms, hedge funds and pension funds who will pressure him to keep the company growing. Young as he may seem — especially in that hooded sweatshirt — Zuckerberg will be about the same age as Michael Dell and older than Steve Jobs when those two took their companies, Dell Inc. and Apple Inc., public. In his years as Facebook's CEO he's met world leaders, rode a bull in Vietnam while on vacation, started learning Mandarin Chinese and as a personal challenge, wore a tie for the better part of a year. Facebook, of course, got its start in Zuckerberg's messy Harvard dorm room in early 2004. Known as Thefacebook.com in those days, the site was created to help Harvard students — and later other college students — connect with one another online. The scrappy website later grew to include high-schoolers, then anyone else with an Internet connection. Today more than 900 million people log in at least once a month, making Facebook the world's definitive social network. All along, Zuckerberg has shown a maturity beyond his years. As the site grew rapidly and caught the eye of big media and rival Internet companies, Zuckerberg consistently rebuffed mouth-watering buyout offers, including those from Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. ""Simply put: we don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his letter to prospective shareholders. ""And we think this is a good way to build something. These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits."" People who've observed Zuckerberg closely say his age is an asset. His is the generation that grew up with social networking, with computers all around them and the Internet as something that's always existed. Many of his employees are younger than him, as are a lot of the up-and-coming technology entrepreneurs with whom he competes. ""I don't think you could build a company like this if you were an old guy like me,"" says David Kirkpatrick, a 59-year-old author who chronicled the company's early history in ""The Facebook Effect."" Kirkpatrick, who is also founder of Techonomy, a media company that hosts conferences on the relationship between technology and economy and social progress, first met Zuckerberg six years ago. He says he was impressed with his vision, even then. ""It's the willingness to take risks, the willingness to abide by a very contemporary vision ... I don't think that he's too young. I think most CEOs are too old."" Zuckerberg, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif. with his girlfriend and a white Hungarian Puli dog named Beast, has matured as a leader with the help of experienced mentors. One of his closest advisers is Sheryl Sandberg, whom he hired away from Google in 2008. Zuckerberg, known for sometimes-awkward public appearances, realized that the razor-sharp, people-savvy advertising executive complements his own shortcomings. Sandberg is Zuckerberg's No. 2, the chief operating officer who oversees advertising and often serves as Facebook's smiling, public face. Then there's Donald Graham, the 66-year-old CEO and chairman of The Washington Post Co., who serves as a mentor to Zuckerberg and holds a seat on Facebook's board of directors. Rebecca Lieb, analyst at the Altimeter Group, says Zuckerberg has assembled a team of ""truly exceptional lieutenants."" David Ebersman, Facebook's chief financial officer, who hails from biotech firm Genentech, is another example. Zuckerberg hired him in 2009, saying that Ebersman's previous job, helping to scale the finance organization of the fast-growing biotech company ""will be important to Facebook."" He was right. Facebook's revenue grew from $777 million in 2009 to $3.7 billion last year. In the first quarter of 2012 it was more than $1 billion. Even so, Zuckerberg still has a lot to learn. As part of Facebook's pre-IPO ""road show"" last week, Zuckerberg visited several venerable East Coast financial institutions wearing his signature hoodie. While Silicon Valley insiders defended his fashion choice, others saw it as a sign of immaturity. Was it, as some speculated, a sign of a rebellious 20-something acting out? For Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities, Zuckerberg's attitude and attire symbolizes ""a level of aloofness to stakeholders."" ""He seems very customer focused and very employee focused. I am not sure he cares about anyone else. ... If he's going to go public, he has to answer to shareholders,"" Pachter says. ""That's why Google hired Eric Schmidt. That's why Steve Jobs was ultimately forced out of Apple."" Jobs, in fact, was another Silicon Valley luminary who had Zuckerberg's ear. He was 25 in 1980 when Apple went public. He was ousted five years later after clashing with John Sculley, the former Pepsico executive Apple hired as chief executive. Jobs famously returned to lead Apple in 1997 and the company has thrived since. Not much is known about the relationship Jobs and Zuckerberg shared, but Jobs reportedly told his biographer Walter Isaacson: ""We talk about social networks in the plural, but I don't see anybody other than Facebook out there. Just Facebook, They are dominating this. I admire Mark Zuckerberg ... for not selling out, for wanting to make a company. I admire that a lot."" When Jobs died last October, Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page, ""Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you."" Jon Burgstone, professor at the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that Zuckerberg will need to keep his perspective and continue developing. ""He has already become one of the world's most famous people, and also the richest,"" he says. ""He walks into a room and you can feel people's excitement and the rush to be near him. He's already had time to learn how to deal with such fame and fortune, but now it's advancing to an entirely new level. How will he handle it, emotionally and professionally?"" Lieb marvels at the life Zuckerberg has led so far. Imagine being in your 20s, a self-made billionaire, your life the subject of a Hollywood movie, 2010's ""The Social Network."" ""It's a lifetime and the guy isn't 30 yet,"" Lieb says. He's made big mistakes, especially with regard to users' privacy. One example is Beacon, Facebook's misguided advertising product that broadcast user's activities on outside websites without their explicit consent. Still, he took steps to correct them. On blog posts about Facebook's privacy blunders, he's admitted the company has made mistakes. His 2007 post about Beacon showed his straightforward, methodical thinking: ""We've made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we've made even more with how we've handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. While I am disappointed with our mistakes, we appreciate all the feedback we have received from our users. I'd like to discuss what we have learned and how we have improved Beacon,"" he wrote five years ago. Facebook shut down Beacon two years later. Zuckerberg has done well for himself so far, but he'll be pulled in many directions once Facebook is public. ""There is going to be a tremendous amount of scrutiny on this company,"" Lieb says. ""Who really is qualified"" to carry such a weight? ____ Follow Barbara Ortutay on Twitter at http://twitter.com/BarbaraOrtutay Stocks slammed!

"Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn ... http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mark-zuckerberg-might-too-170039566.html Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful - Yahoo Finance Why Mark Zuckerberg Might Be Too Successful May 9, 2012 4:55 PM In its brief, eight-year history, Facebook has become one of the all-time legendary success stories. But there's still one thing missing from founder Mark Zuckerberg's resume: A prominent failure to learn from. [ Photos: Occupy Wall Street: Fighting or Floundering? ] Of course, we'd all avoid failure if we could. But setbacks happen to just about everybody, and they often turn out to be the most instructive experiences we ever go through. ""Ask one hundred people, 'What have you learned from success?' and most of them will just look at you,"" former Coca-Cola president Don Keough told me while I was researching my book Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success . ""But ask, 'What have you learned from failure?' and you'll get lots of answers."" Setbacks usually don't feel so illuminating when they're happening, and some people don't even like to admit when something goes wrong. But just about every business involves some kind of risk, which makes flops and failures inevitable. That's especially true in Silicon Valley, where investors routinely take big risks on startups. As a rule of thumb, about 40 percent of startups funded by venture capitalists fail, 40 percent are successful enough to return their initial investment, and only 20 percent turn out to be good investments that return a healthy profit. And only a fraction of those enjoy the staggering success that Facebook is poised to enjoy in its huge public offering. With a high risk of failure, venture capitalists don't worry so much about preventing it. Instead, they try to spot failures early, so that resources aren't wasted beyond the point of no return. They also intently study failures in order to make sure there's no missed opportunity or new direction that might be more productive. As many investors know, for example, Viagra was initially developed as a hypertension drug that didn't pan out. Only by accident did researchers notice that it seemed to enhance the sexual potency of male rabbits, leading to its development as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. [ See 6 reasons America will rebound .] Savvy investors also value failure as an essential ingredient in the seasoning needed to develop capable business leaders. ""When considering investing in a company, I always ask a CEO, 'Tell me about your failures,'"" says one prominent venture capitalist. ""If you haven't had a failure, you don't have your strength. Somebody who has only experienced success is likely to be so convinced they're brilliant that it never occurs to them they might just be lucky."" Mark Zuckerberg is probably both brilliant and lucky. He's clearly a visionary who figured out new ways to use technology to connect people. He's also lucky he became a programmer just as the Internet became the backbone of mass communication. Talent and luck can be a pretty awesome combination, so it's no surprise Zuckerberg is already a technology titan and billionaire before his 30th birthday. But he may also be a massive case of hubris in the making. Zuckerberg has structured Facebook so that he'll retain an extraordinary degree of control, even after five percent of the shares go public. He negotiated the recent $1 billion acquisition of Instagram almost entirely on his own, over a weekend, with minimal input from his board or other senior executives. Facebook's registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission even states that Zuckerberg and his family and friends can fly on company-financed planes, for personal use, with the cost accounted for as Zuckerberg's ""other compensation."" It's hard to think of another sizeable company so dominated by one person, especially one so untouched by marketplace ups and downs. [ See why Apple could get even bigger .] If Zuckerberg's meteoric success convinces him that he's infallible, Facebook will be in trouble. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers seems to have developed a sense of invulnerability, which prevented him from spotting what was really wrong with his firm--and possibly saving it--before it went bankrupt. Rupert Murdoch's sense of omnipotence may have led him to believe his company, News Corp., could break the law and get away with it. Yet the phone-hacking scandal at Murdoch's British papers has damaged the entire company. Many other corporate titans fumbled because they became too convinced that they could do no wrong. Setbacks leaven that type of arrogance. When I was researching , Tim Westergren, the founder of Internet radio company Pandora, told me about the difficulties he faced in two prior careers before he got the idea for Pandora, and the several near-death experiences Pandora had while he was trying to get it off the ground. Those challenges gave Westergren the opportunity to use and build his talents, but they also revealed the limits of his abilities. ""I'm in the church of humility,"" he told me. ""If you're humble, you don't get caught up in the trappings of success, which can be very corrupting for most people. You can get drunk on that if you're not humble."" We now get to see whether Mark Zuckerberg can beat the odds, and stay sober-minded in spite of his gargantuan success.
