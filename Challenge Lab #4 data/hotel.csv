"Oct 12 2021 	Nice trendy hotel location not too bad.	I stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat! Sep 25 2021 	Great Budget Hotel!	Stayed two nights at Aloft on the most recent trip to China. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was spotless and a comfortable king sized bed (as far as soft beds go in China). The staff was very punctual and went out of the way to help my every need, including going to a store across the street to purchase a China Mobile SIM card for me. The buffet breakfast was okay, nothing to write home about. The 42” LCD screen had movies on demand for 20RMB and had a good selection of western channels including HBO, CNN, BBC, Star World etc… The gym was small, had a selection of basic weights and one cable machine, there was however 6 new TechnoGym cardio machines with built in LCD TVs which were very good. The location is a bit out of the way to the central areas of Beijing, but it is better suited for my needs as I need to be in the Haidian district. Being SPG Platinum there were no upgrades to a better room, because Aloft has a policy of not doing any upgrades. The Sheraton next door is a much nicer hotel in my opinion (where I am writing this from now, with an upgraded room) but as far as bang for the buck, Aloft is a great place! Aug 4 2021 	Excellent value - location not a big problem.	We stayed at the Aloft Beijing Haidian for 5 nights from July 17 - 22nd. There are lots of reviews that talk about the location being a problem but we knew this ahead of time and found that it really wasn't an issue. The longest we spent in a taxi was about 30 minutes. We never paid more than 50rmb for a taxi ride (which is about $8 Cdn) and that was to the Forbidden City. Given there are 4 in our family, it was no big deal at all.As for the rooms, they were clean, the beds comfortable, the wireless internet connection reliable and it was one of the few hotels we found in Beijing that would accomodate 2 adults and 2 children. We paid about $70 Cdn. per night. That's an amazing price.It's not meant to be a 5 star hotel so you can't go in expecting that. We found the reception staff generally very helpful and friendly. They aren't the fastest in the world but it wasn't unreasonable at all.The hotel manager made an effort to speak with us a few times and was extremely helpful and welcoming. Their breakfast buffet was quite good and reasonably priced. There are a number of good restaurants in the Four Points Sheraton next door so there were lots of options. There is a massive mall about a block away that has other dining options as well.The only issue we ran into was a few taxi drivers refusing to take us to the Summer Palace because I guess they felt it wasn't far enough. The minimum rate is 10rmb. But the staff at the Four Points Sheraton (which is on a busier road than the side street for Aloft) were quite helpful in finding taxis for us if they weren't already there.We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends for its excellent value. Jul 17 2021 	Stylish clean reasonable value poor location	I am glad to be the first person to post photos of this hotel. Key points about this property:- its a starwood property, much cheaper than the rest, and it shows in the pretty incompetent reception staff, the hard bed, the cheap blinds that don't quite block out the sun in the mornings, and common areas which seem to be degrading very quickly (given how new this hotel is).- on the up side, it is very clean and tidy, and if that is important to you, this hotel presents good value. It is also quite stylishly designed and looks much more modern than anything else in this price range.- location is poor for the typical tourist. Yes, very poor. It is not really close to much cheaper the summer palace, and other places will require a taxi, which will probably result in hours of being frustratingly stuck in traffic. Taxi drivers also dont know where it is. If coming from the East, (i.e. city centre or airport) then it is the right turn AFTER the Four Points hotel, which is adjacent. If you are trying to scam an SPG platinum status in the cheapest way possible, perhaps stay in these two adjacent SPG hotels for 25 nights and check out every night.On the whole I thought it was decent value, but dollar for dollar, I would personally prefer to pay double for the Westin in Chaoyang or Financial Street. I have stayed at both at approx. double the price, for real 5 star service. But if thats not in your budget and you want the assurance of an international hotel chain, this hotel is perfect for you.Lastly, this hotel may also be appropriate for university students in Haidian, but don't pick this unless you know what you are doing. Taxis to BLCU or Tsing Hua may be exceptionally frustrating because of constant traffic around Zhong guan cun street. Tell taxi drivers to go on the four ring road, even though it might be a bit more expensive.There is free internet, but it does not seem to work with iPhones. May 30 2021 	Remote but excellent value for money	Stayed there for one night. The hotel is located in Haidian, which is a little bit remote. But if you don't mind taking the taxi to the closest subway station, which costs only 15-20 CNY a ride the hotel represents excellent value for money given its low prices and the modern, quiet and very clean rooms. Also internet use is for free. Especially for travellors who don't want to spend the money for a Hyatt or Hilton but who look for a very decent place to stay this hotel represents an excellent choice. Dec 31 2018 	Good value but not downtown	This hotel is located next to the Four Points Hotel and are both part of the Starwood group. For those wanting a downtown location, this property may not be for you - I recommend factoring in taxi fares in and out of town when working out the value here. On the otherside, the rates for the hotel are very good and the rooms are basic but well appointed. TV was more focused on local channels which may be an indication of the clients they are targeting. There was however the standard HBO, BBC, etc. Staff were very friendly and check in and check out times were acceptable. Jul 20 2021 	???????????????????"
"VERY NICE HOTEL	We get vacation every year after my wedding. But up to now more than four years we work hard and prepare for great vacation for 4 months we choose Asia is our destination First stop in Beijing we stayed in this hotel.Hotel not too big but the room was nice and comfortable. We liked this and enjoyed it. Nov 19 2021 	A fantastic hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Autumn Garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from Moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. Staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of Beijing. We loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. The location was wonderful too, only 10 minutes walk to Tiananmen square. Sep 11 2021 	nice place to stay	The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals. Dec 14 2018 	Reccomended	This is a great little hotel, I booked this hotel based on previous reviews, so I thought I would come on here and recommend it myself.I went to Beijing on my own for 4 nights to see what its like. It is quite a crazy place, Chinese people seem to take advantage of tourists at every possible opportunity.The Autumn Garden Hotel however is amazing, such nice people, and I consider it a great price for what I got. Its location is great if you want to get a slight feel of what its like living in China.You need to walk down a couple of narrow alley ways to get to the Hotel, but it is very close to Tienanmen Square, with a lot of sites close by, such as the Temple of Heaven and Forbidden City within walking distance. Also there is a touring company with nice and cheap tours (although in Chinese) which is less than 10 minutes walk away next to Tienanmen Square.The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast is simple but decent. The People are fantastic, talk English and are very very helpful. They picked me up from the airport without any charge, Im not sure if this is a regular service, but it was helpful. If it is your first time in China, I recommend getting picked up, as taxi drivers talk very little English if any at all, and the Hotel can be hard to find, Taxi drivers wont know it.The hotel welcomes you very nicely, and give you a map to the area and to the hotel, and even a mobile phone to use while you stay with them.The hotel had everything you should need, but I was truly impressed by the service there which easily allows me to recommend it. In contrast to most of the Chinese which I met who seemed to try and take me for every cent that I had, this little hotel was there for me for every need, without trying to charge me for the help that they offered, or even the things which I expected to pay for such as the half a day late checkout, or airport pick up.If you want a simple, relaxing, and friendly stay, try the Autumn Garden. I will no doubt be staying there again on my next visit. Nov 10 2018	an oasis in Beijing	Just got back from Beijing and a wonderful experience staying in the middle of a hutong (maze of alleyways) in Beijing, just next door to Tian'anmen Square. This inn is truly an oasis in a crazy busy city and right in the middle of what feels like 50 years ago - staff were so welcoming and accomodating - if you want a taxi, they have one - we went to the Great Wall with our very own driver - even had a (very simple) lunch prepared by one of the staff - who were all delightful - lovely courtyard - very quiet even though in the midst of chaos - a real feel for old China - haven't downloaded our photos yet, but willing to share if anyone is interested! Nov 1 2018 	Lovely traditional style hotel	This is a really lovely traditional style hotel, located literally just 5 minutes walk away from Tianmen square as well as lots of eating options &amp; shops. The girls at the front desk were very friendly, helpful and spoke good english. The rooms are very pretty and comfortable, with modern western style bathrooms. Since it's located in the hutong (lots of narrow, confusing alley ways) It's a good idea to take with you the address of the hotel writen in Chinese characters as well as the phone number, so the taxi driver can call for directions. We were given a mobile to use during our stay - and took it with us when we went off to North Korea for a week and then called when we got back, and they sent out a car to pick us up from the station. On our return we also got upgraded to a bigger room. The bathrooms were pretty much the same in both rooms - the sinks make a brilliant nose when you tap them. I booked, as I usually do, on www.venere.com - this is an excellent website and no down payment required. Aug 25 2018 	Living it the Beijing way	As I was looking for accommodation for my visit during the Olympics in late 2017, most of the major hotels were not available for booking for IOC-related room blocks. Which means when I booked it everything everywhere was very expensive. Then I found this little courtyard hotel, and was charged at least 4 times their published rates, yet still I am happy with what I got. Situated 3 &quot;layers&quot; deep from the main streets, you will either need to have good map reading skills to navigate your way to find this on your own... or you could use their free tricycle service which would pick you up from either Qianmen or Hepingmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant.I love the surrounding of this guesthouse. It is a typical hutong where houses are one next to the other, and rather peaceful and quiet. That means it's not the best place to stay if you are expecting upper class and polished streets. In fact, you will find at least 3 smelly public toilets along the way to the guesthouse. But that's what's genuine about the neighbourhood. The location is also quite fantastic... a 5-10 minute walk (or less with tricycle) would bring you to the subway station (Hepingmen and Qianmen), and also Tiananmen Square... that's a big plus for those who like to travel the local way (on foot or subway).Rooms are not big, but adequate, with modern bathroom amenities (good and strong hot showers!). Room rates include free use of internet and breakfast (Chinese or western style, pick whatever you want).You cannot reach this place by taxi, so be ready to have a little hassle when you arrive and depart. The tricycle rider is friendly and could get you to the main streets. I arrived in a chauffeured car and the driver had no clue where it was and luckily I did my research and found the property myself. Although I paid the rate for a 5-star hotel, I wouldn't have done it any other way."
"Dec 24 2017 	Nice property	We booked a three bedroom room for $92/nite, each room came with a queen size bed. Also included was a kitchen with frig and microwave, and a washer dryer. There was also a dining area and living room, where we could sit down at night and go over all the booty collected in a days shopping. While the rooms were very spartan and lacked color, the room was very clean. The location is great and I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, except Leon Helmsley, who would probably prefer the Astoria. Sep 15 2016 	Great hotel for large groups! (and individuals...)	I traveled to Beijing in June 2016 with 6 friends and we needed an inexpensive hotel that would hold our large group. The Century Towers Beijing hotel was PERFECT. We made a reservation through www.sinohotel.com, which I was nervous about at first, not being familiar with them. The customer service reps were fantastic, responding to all my spastic e-mails quickly and with great care. When we arrived at the Hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on SinoHotel.com so there were no $$ issues. We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment-style space (the &quot;large&quot; version offered on the website), with 2 full bathrooms (American Standard fixtures) a full kitchen, and a dining room. It even included a washer/dryer in the unit, though we didn't have any need to use it. The apartment was very clean, air-conditioned, and spacious, even with the 7 of us, we had plenty of room to relax! The hotel is across the street from a HUGE supermarket, so we ended up cooking most breakfasts in the room, saving even more money! We kept lots of cold bottled water in the fridge to take with us on our adventures in the hot, dry summer weather of Beijing. The room included a large flat-screen TV in the living room with cable, and a few English-language channels like the BBC (and the Simpsons!)Other really nice aspects of the hotel include a work-out room in the basement with treadmills, stationary bikes, a rowing machine, ballet bar, free weights, and weight machines. The hotel restaurant is very small but serves good food. The wait staff (and most of China) speak very little English, so learn basic Chinese phrases and expec to smile and point a lot :) We are traveling to Shanghai in the Summer of 2017 and if Century Towers has a location there, we would absolutely stay again! I think the price is much cheaper at this hotel because it's a Chinese hotel, not a foreign chain. We paid about $85 USD/night for this large 3 bedroom apartment-style room. Between the 7 of us, the price was certainly right!"
"Nov 4 2021 	Disappointed.	The hotel is out of the city centre, about 20 minutes walk to T Square. None of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was - I had to show them on the map and at least 2 had to stop to ask for directions. The staff were not especially friendly or organised. The staff in the restaurant were not at all welcoming to solo travellers. For 2 nights I was sandwiched between a group of schoolgirls who spent their nights running up and down the corridor sqealing. The hotel shop is vastly overpriced - there is a grocery shop just down the road which is a lot cheaper. I'm sure there are better hotels in Beijing for the same price. Aug 1 2021 	good value	The hotel is a well located good a/c quality 3 star hotel, a fact that should be remembered when evaluating ratings. It is easily accessible to all the places you will want to go. Taxis are cheap as are the buses. Get the hotel to write down the name of where you want to go and take the hotel card with you. Pleasant courtyard to sit around with access to the coffee shop, but beware the price of coffee. Good breakfast in upstairs dining room - asian and american and lunch buffet for $8. There is a good massage establishment in the hotel. Jun 22 2021 	would look at other hotels	This is a very large hotel and caters for large groups but there are only two lifts to manage this large number of people. At peak times its very difficult to get on which is very frustrating. Most of the staff I encountered were far from friendly. My tour guide commented she received a large number of complaints from guests who stayed here. I will say though that the room was roomy and lovely and clean. May 31 2021 	Clean room friendly staff..satisfied	My husband and I recently stayed at the Dong Fang for 3 nights and although we cannot comment on its location--we had transportation organized for our whole stay--I must say the room was clean and provides the basic necessities. My major disappointment was the bed..I love a soft bed and unfortunately the bed was of typical Chinese form--not very soft.As for the staff, they were always smiling and always very helpful. We were content with their level of English.As for the breakfast that was included with our package, it wasn't bad..for all the health buffs, I think it could be a problem but for us it filled our stomachs before a long day of tours, no complaints!Be warned that the walls are a bit thin..was woken up at one point by some noise next door, but it didn't ruin our trip. Something to consider **wink wink**Overall, we had a pleasant stay. Have no regrets considering this was an on the spot choice without any research. Oct 21 2018 	Nice hotel	We stayed two nights and had a nice room, enjoyed the breakfast and also had dinner in the hotels both evenings which was nice and also affordable (we ordered off the menu which seemed to be special as most people had the buffet). The only downside is it is not easy to reach with public transport. We travelled to the nearest metro station Heping Gate station and walked down to Zhushikou East St and walked down a very small side street. To go to the airport we caught a taxi which we preordered at reception. Jul 15 2018 	Comfortable hotel good location	We stayed at the Dong Fang Hotel in Beijing for three nights at the beginning of a China tour. The hotel has a good continental breakfast with many choices, both Western and Asian. The coffee and the coffee shop were also quite good. The front desk was helpful and spoke enough English for us to all understand each other. We found that sitting on the beds made them seem hard, but sleeping on them was actually quite comfortable. The TV received three English-speaking channels. Money can be exchanged at the front desk, and there is also an ATM just off the lobby. We thought the best feature of this hotel was its proximity to Tianeman Square--we were able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Overall, we were pleased with the experience. Jun 27 2018	Loved the Dong Fang!	This was our last stop on an organized tour through Shanghai, Xi'an and finally Beijing. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The staff was very helpful and spoke enough English to successfully communicate with a diverse group of travelers who spoke heavily accented French/German/Russian/Australian/etc. English.Also, the daytime assistant manager is a handsome and charming Jet Li look-alike.Great place-will stay again!Beiing is the best! Mar 29 2018 	Nice New Hotel	We stayed at the Dong Fang for a couple of days as part of our tour package with the Great Wall Marathon (which was an incredible experience, I would recommend to even a non-runner). My impression was that the Dong Fang was brand new and had just opened prior to our arrival. All of the hallways smelled like new carpet and everything, from the lobby to the restraunt to the rooms, was very clean. Most of the employees were also new, working on their English phrases, but on the whole very pleasant and helpfull. After checking in, we walked from the hotel to Tiannemen Square - it was certainly not a short walk, about 30 minutes, but we enjoyed the scenery. We walked through one of the classic &quot;hutongs&quot; and a street market en route. Otherwise, your best bet is to get a cab from the hotel to the more popular sites. The location is the only possible downside. Otherwise, the lobby had a nice little bar, great authentic food at the restraunt, and the rooms were very nice with all the amenties you would expect in a modern, western-style hotel, to include the little soaps and shampoos! Mar 19 2018	great hotel	We stayed at the dong fang hotel in beijing mar 2018 on a organised tour round china .I was a bit concerned after reading reviews on this site so i was pleasantly suprised staff were very welcoming and registration went smoothly. We had a double room which looked like it had just being refurbed probaby due to the olympics and bathroom was of a decent size with all the usual freebies. My only dissapointment was the restaurant food it wasnt up to much but that may have been because we were in a group so had a buffet most of the time so cannot comment on indvidual meals. Downstairs in the lobby was a coffee house which was very pleasant although a little expensive for alchol. I would defineatley reccomend this hotel. Beijing itself was good if not a little drab but the pollution was terrible we all went away with sore throats. How they are going to compete in the olympics is beyond me. Mar 8 2018	Nice hotel a bit far out though	Nice hotel, rooms very modern &amp; clean, breakfast lovely &amp; a good choice, surrounding area is a few shops &amp; restaurants, nice coffee shop in the hotel itself. A bit far out to visit all the sights, we were in an organised tour which was great, but independantly it's a bit far out.Had a room on the 12th floor which was fab, offering lovely views over the city. Fairly quiet as high up apart from the end of Chinese New Year!!! It was fantastic &amp; we were treated to fireworkds and firecrackers all over the city! Feb 2 2018	Average But Nice And Friendly	This was the first hotel we stayed in as part of a trip with Voyages Jules Verne. We arrived on Friday 25th January 2018 and given a room on the 8th floor. Although this was a non-smoking room it did in fact smell slightly smokey as smoking is allowed in the corridors. The room itself was ample in size and I found the beds very comfortable. There was an in-room safe and a decent sized bathroom with powerful shower over the bathtub.The reception staff were all very polite and changing money was not a problem. Their rate was better than back home in England offering almost 14 Yuan to the pound.My only little niggle about this hotel was the fact that the staff in the bar were not consistent with their drink prices. Four gin and tonics and a small white wine cost around £16.00. Each evening a crowd of us (16 persons usually) would meet up in the bar at the end of our sight-seeing trips (usually around 9-9.30pm) and have a few drinks. What I did find annoying was that one night a bottle of beer was 20 Yuan and the next night they would charge 22 Yuan. Ok I know it's only an extra 15p but we were good customers and on average each couple would drink about 12 bottles between them so there was no need to rip us off. By the way the bar closes at Midnight.Directly across the road from the hotel is a small brothel and scantily clad girls would parade themselves in the large glass window touting for business. This was not a problem and they never came into the hotel, but if you are a prude you maybe offended. Our group consisting of various ages did'nt have a problem with this. In fact it was a talking point.It was only when we went to Shanghai during the second part of our holiday and stayed in the Jinshajiang hotel (What a joke) that I really appreciated just how nice the Dong Fang was in comparrison.I have rated this hotel a three, but it probably derserves a three and a half. Dec 24 2007 	Not great	We were booked here for 3 nights as part of a tour. The bed was very hard, could have slept on the floor. Bed linen and pillows smelled of smoke. Hotel staff were not friendly although the doorman was good.Room was not over clean. Buffet Breakfast was good with a range to choose from the buffet.Would not stay at this hotel again. Nov 25 2007	A comfortable place to stay with a good bar	this is a comfortable and clean 4 star hotel centrally located in Beijing although, given the size of the city, it's still a taxi or bus ride from the sights. Friendly staff and a pleasant coffee shop which is in an older part of the building has lots of character. Distant views from the higher floors of Beijing through the smog. There's a good variety of European and Chinese foods for breakfast and the cafe, named 1918 after the date the original part of the hotel was built, doubles as a great bar. Check the address carefully to make sure you have the right hotel as there are a few DongFang hotels as it means “dynasty” in Chinese. Oct 22 2007	great hotel exceeded our expectations!!!	This hotel was where we were booked to stay at the end of a tour and we were a bit apprehensive,but it was great, exceeded our expectations!! We were able to check in at 8am after an overnight train journey from Shanghai.Staff were helpful and friendly although not all spoke fluent. English.The room was spacious, bright and spotlessly clean.Lovely comfortable bed,very modern and clean bathroom(no bathtub, just a shower) with bed linen and towels changed and bathroom toiletries replenished daily.Breakfast was an extensive western and chinese buffet with eggs cooked to order.It was busy but well organised.Insulated jugs of tea and coffee were on the tables.Internet was available from the business centre.Coffee shop was also good.Only problem we had in Beijing was with Taxis.They didnt seem to want to take westerners!!!Other members of our group had problems as well.They would only bring you back to the hotel for a fixed rate of 40 or 50 RMB.When going into the city the hotel called taxis for us several times and the fare was metered, usually 25 to 30 RMB.What will happen in 2018 and the city is flooded with westerners there for the Olympics???? Apart from that we had a great stay.Silk Street shopping centre is great for shopping ,at night we went to Snack Street near Wangfuging Street and as well as shops, one side of the road has loads of food stalls with all sorts of food, cooked as you wait ,a great experience! If you are very brave you can try scorpion!!!!We hope to return to Beijing and would stay at The Dong Fang Hotel again. Jan 20 2007	Ok only	This hotel is ok. It can use a bit of updating. Somewhat clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast buffet was quite extensive with both western and chinese styles. Guests were allowed to smoke in the dining room. Internet access in the business center on first floor (RMB1/minute). Hotel is about 5 minutes walk to the Merry Mart Supermarket where you can get your supply of bottled water, snacks and other essentials. There are some non-legal cab drivers hanging out outside the hotel. Be sure to get one who uses the meter. It costs RMB15 to get you from the hotel to Wangfujing street (Tiananmen Sq and Forbidden City). Same vice versa. If the driver quotes you a fixed price, find another cab! They can be quite pushy. The hotel apparently does not discourage illegal cabbies from trying to get customers inside the hotel. Jul 6 2006	The Beijing Dong Feng Hotel	I recently stayed at the Beijing Dong Feng Hotel as part of my Exodus Adventure trip and it exceeded my expectation.The hotel has recently been refurbished. The rooms were large and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious with fresh towels everyday.There was also a buffet breakfast every morning including fresh fruit, juices, eggs, sausages, toast etc and tea and coffee.The staff were friendly and it has a great location. Not far from all the main sights in Beijing. I would stay here again. May 29 2006	Beijing Dongfang hotel was reasonable 	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Great Wall Marathon group. All rooms being totally refurbished and while still 3 star, is good. location is a relatively short walk or a very cheap taxi to Tianemen Square. Good breakfast included in our price. Staff can speak some english. Mar 4 2005	Simple but ok hotel	The Dong Fang Hotel was included in my trip. Lobby is nice. Hotel rooms are simple (outdated) but clean. Employees where friendly, had no problems. Breakfast was simple (in western restaurant). Stayed for one week. Location is perfect, walk in about 30 minutes to Tiananmen Square / Forbidden city. Taxi to centrum will cost you about 1.5$ in 10 minutes from the Hotel. TV with 2 English channels (HBO and ?).Overall: Ok hotel to stay but rooms are simple, if you have a choice maybe go to a higher standard one.R.P. / Netherlands Dec 3 2004	Okay Hotel but hookers everywhere?!	I stayed in the Dong Fang Hotel, Beijing around a month ago (20th October) for several days. The lobby is quite decent initially and overall the hotel seems good, however on closer inspection the hotel is quite dirty, the rooms were not very nice at all. However, perhaps, since this was my first time in China, it is a typical standard there, yet for my British standard it wasn't really good enough.But by no means is it a terrible hotel, and by all means for reasonable accomadation stay there. I did have another problem which was that hookers were everywhere in the hotel, there was a so called 'Karaoke' bar from in the lobby, and a 'nightclub' no the top floor. Yet they were both quite clearly brothels, though once again perhaps this is typical in China but was slightly unerving for me. Oct 29 2007 	waren positiv überascht!!"
"Dec 2 2018 	Love it Love it	I stayed at this hotel for one night in November. The person who booked this hotel told me that it was recently remodeled right before the Olympics. With $90 a night, I was more than willing to give it a try. It's off the crazy 3rd Ring road (San Huan), so traffic seems moderate. US and Japanese embassies are within walking distance. There is a food street adjacent to it. I did not get a chance to explore it. It can be an interesting place to get a bite if you are tied of the hotel menus. I had a single room with a king size bed. Not huge space, but plenty room for what I need. It's well decorated, modern and hi-tech, and smells clean too. The bed is very comfortable. Sheets and towels show very little use. The LCD TV has many international channels, American, French, German, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Australian ... plus many more I can't even recognize. The breakfast was only okay, not a huge selection compared to what I had elsewhere, but not bad either for 80 yuan. I changed American dollars to local yuan at its business center at an incredible rate 6.795 while other hotels usually gave me 6.4 or even lower. Overalll, to me, it is a smaller version of Hilton, just one block away across the street. You only pay half of Hilton's price. I will definitely stay there again next time. Oct 21 2018 	Great value great hotel all around	When I booked this hotel, I had some pretty low expectations knowing that in China sometimes you get exactly what you pay for, and often even that ratio is a stretch. What a pleasant surprise I had when I got into my room, it was absolutely clean and perfect for my business trip. I had stayed at the intercontinental hotel a few weeks before in Beijing for literally 5 times the price of the Guangming, and the room was almost exactly the same. The stigma of Chinese hotels has finally been reversed, long live the Guangming... The lobby was clean and 5 star-ish, the service was excellent, but the rooms were exemplary and this hotel is certainly one I'll go back to for all of my business trips in the future. Booking with Ctrip gave me some sort of special on free internet in my room which was another little bonus of this place. The only annoying thing was the breakfast, which though edible was certainly not anywhere close to the intercontinental. But then again, with the money I saved I made sure to treat myself to a nice brunch at a nice brunch spot in the embassy district. A good hotel all around, and its a great location, check it out and thank me later."
"Oct 9 2021 	Excellent location for walking/exploring and fabulous breakfast for China!	h my nine year old daughter and would normally overlook hostels, but I was drawn to this one by the reviews and location. The ensuite with two twin beds was small but convenient, with cozy duvets and cable TV. (Also includes an electric water pot and tea, a chair, desk and side table.) For $37 US, it was a very good deal, especially in all the hubbub leading up to the 60th Anniversary. The bathroom had a strong sewer smell (welcome to China; it's pretty normal) and the one extra electric outlet was broken, but it was generally clean and the public areas were immaculate.The hostel is tucked in a quiet alley not far (maybe one block) from a bus stop. (Catch the #2 on the same side of street as the hostel to head to Tiananmen East/ #1 subway line or Qianmen/ #2 line) It is nestled between the Forbidden City and WanfangJie, the walking &amp; shopping street. It is also just a few blocks from the Night Market (tasty and exotic treats - from candied fruits to grilled lizards and seahorses), which runs from about 6-10 pm nightly. My daughter is pretty tough for 9 and we walked all over the city, but the front desk will also help arrange taxis or the information room attendant can help with travel logistics. They also have several tours they'll sell you (expensive compared to using public transit, but competitive prices compared to other tour operators). We opted for public transit and had a blast (and total solitude!) at Great Wall Simatai. We walked to the Forbidden City, to JingshanYuan (2 kuai, highest point in the city with a bueatiful temple that looks straight down on the Forbidden City), Bei Hai Park (20 kuai, with 5 kuai ferry rides across the lake and plenty of cultural relics and nice park areas) and all around T Square. We also used the subway often, which was crowded but easy to navigate and VERY cheap (2kuai per single journey).We were gone all day every day, so took advantage of the safe lockers by the front desk - 1 kuai each time you lock it but well worth it &amp; big enough for a computer and small personal items.We stayed several days and enjoyed the breakfast - the best I've seen in China, even in the fancier high dollar hotels. It always had a couple of Chinese dishes (spring rolls, noodles, fried rice,) either scrambled or fried eggs plus boiled eggs, croissants &amp; jam, veggies and dressing, meusli and fresh yogurt and fruit. The breakfast area and reading room are nicely decorated in traditional style, and don't forget to try on the Emperor/ Empress suits in the Information room and get your photo! (Take your own photo, but donning the suits is free.)There is a supermarket (turn left outside the alley, about one block on left) with plenty of fresh fruits &amp; veggies and even some western niceties (lunch meat &amp; sliced bread - even wheat!) without the upscale import prices. There's decent wireless internet in the lobby, and I was sometimes also able to pick it up in the room. It's free, but I believe there's a small charge for using their computers in the internet room.Overall, the staff was really friendly but not necessarily very helpful. They speak some decent English and run to help you with taxis, but if there is a problem you may get the Asian shrug-off. With the great location, breakfast, and moderately nice facility, I would certainly stay again and recommend it to friends. Had I not had my daughter, I would not have opted for the ensuite - save yourself the stink and get an even better deal for a fabulous location! As always, take ear plugs just in case! (I never needed mine.) Aug 20 2021 	Great place to stay	Really affordable with friendly staff. Located about 10 mins from Forbidden City which is a must see attraction. Handy supermarket a couple of doors down, with really cheap water and other food stuffs. If you opt for breakfast as a extra it's a little expensive compared with food everywhere else at 30Y , but is an all you can eat, we enjoyed the museli. The information office here are really helpful and can book tours along the great wall etc. and train tickets, they found us cheap flights to Hong Kong. Jul 29 2021 	Jade International Youth hotel	Excellent budget hotel with all the facilities that you need. In walking distance for shopping and most of the major sights.Would recommend to anyone. Jun 10 2021 	Good value in great location	Friendly staff, secure and pleasant facilities, right in heart of historic area. While there are more exotic and charming hostelling locations in the city, this facility is a well-run hotel-like option (as opposed to siheyuan/courtyard house option) within 10 minute walk of the east end of Tiananmen Square. However, being halfway down a long alley, it is not a well-known hotel nor is it an easy location to describe to a taxi driver.Free WiFi in the lobby is a nice amenity. Hostel staff took my heavy rolling luggage and escorted me into the lobby when I first arrived--better service than expected! They also watched the courtyard to ensure those who entered were residents or had business there.I was pleased with my three night stay. Apr 9 2021 	Exceptionally Good	We booked just the one night here due to time constraints.The service was excellent - polite, efficient and informed.We were surprised by quite how good the en-suite twin room was. This is only supposed to be a hostel but it is 3-star hotel standard.The location is excellent - close by the Forbidden City and a leisurely 15-minute stroll down to Tian'anmen Square. The nearest metro (Dengshikou, I think it was) is about 10 minutes walk away (once you realise that it's quicker walking down the alleys) and the nearest bus stop is about two minutes away.The amenities are very good - reception, restaurant and tourist office.We liked everything about this place.If you require very comfortable accommodation in a very central location with very helpful staff then this place is it - at an unbeatable price. Feb 18 2021 	Love this hostel :)	This hostel is so cool. Staff are all friendly and nice. Clean rooms. Wi-fi access in lobby is very useful. Location also rocks. Rates are very affordable. You'll be amazed when you see the rooms. If you'll go to Beijing, I will suggest that you stay here. More value for money? Stay in this hostel :) It's also near food strip. Nov 2 2018 	Hotel standard rooms...	Rooms here are small, but clean. We stayed in a standard room with private ensuite. TV in room. Comfortable bed. Room is cleaned daily, and towels, soap, toothbrushes etc are provided. Chinese style bathroom: no partition between the shower area and the rest of the bathroom. Good location: 10 mins walk to Forbidden City or Wangfujing shopping street. Free bike hire with 600 RMB deposit. Free wireless internet in the lobby and bar area. Otherwise you can use their computers for 1 RMB for 6 minutes. Huge common area with TV, stereo and couches and books to read.Can be a little noisy at night, so bring ear-plugs if you are a light sleeper. Reception staff are very helpful with directions etc. Washing machine and dryer facilities available for a fee. They provide a free pick-up service from Beijing Railway Station if you call in advance. We took the Airport Bus from PEK (18 RMB), then jumped in a cab to get to the hostel. Cab driver got lost, so we had to put him on the phone to the hostel. Buffet breakfast is 35 RMB. Eggs, onion rings, toast, croissants, fried rice, noodles etc. Ok, but not fabulous. Apr 16 2018 	Loved the fish tank	Booked accommodation through a language school - stayed for just over two weeks. I have never stayed in a youth hostel and didn't know what to expect this experience was a good one. I had a room on the third floor, twin for single use with shower room(standard). I didn't have any problems with noise, just the occasional late returner to hotel at weekend and that can be the same in any hotel. The hotel was refurbished about two years ago. The shower room is modern with pretty good fittings, tiled floor modern toilet (a toilet to sit on is not always found in Beijing) hairdryer and regular supplies of toilet paper, towels changed every day. Bedroom is part tiled and part wood effect flooring. TV and kettle provided with a couple of T bags every day. Lighting in room is OK but if you like reading in bed take a mini light. The hotel has a lot of English speaking staff - some have the minimum few words others a pretty good command of the language and they battle with the dozens of accents they come across every day. Comfortable seating in the reception area try to be there when they feed the fish with other tiny live fish. Seating area in the bar with big widescreen TV with DVDs available. Food and drink prices are reasonable, bar food is mostly western style and aimed at backpackers/students. Its not bad though and I believe Chinese food is available but I'm not sure when because I never managed to be there. Breakfast buffet is now 35 yuan. Food OK. Tea and coffee arrangements are hit and miss. Take your own tea bag and ask for hot water. Coffee isn't bad if it is hot. Internet access is not wireless so if you have skype etc you need the right equipment pay at reception and then find your allocated PC. The hotel is clean, well serviced and the staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel position is great for walking to sights - it won't suit you if you want a subway station on the doorstep. No problem if you understand the bus routes or are prepared to walk (about 15 mins). The hotel has the required cards to show taxi drivers to get you to the tourist areas or back to the hotel. If you are going to use the taxis a lot get someone in the hotel to write out the address in large print. Lots of the taxi drivers just need to wear glasses for reading! If you find a good taxi driver try to get their card and get a quote for anything you want to do farther afield. 3 or 4 people in a taxi to the wall is cheaper than an organised bus trip and you can get their earlier before the crowds.Beijing is safe to walk around, the area is residential so you won't see that many people late at night but it's OK even as a lone female. The people in the hutong close to the hotel are pleasant and used to the guests tramping through on the way into the centre. Bikes can be rented and tours/cars to airport can be arranged by the hotel. Changing money at reception is actually cheaper than using an ATM. Security boxes available 1 yuan per use. Dec 10 2007 	Great Budget Accomodations	I booked a private room at this youth hostel. Having stayed at hostels before, I can say this was much better than most, if not all. Clean, all the amenities you could ever want or need, and you can't beat the location. Dec 2 2007 	Great location - friendly staff and clean	Myself and my girlfriend stayed at the Jade Youth Hostel for a few nights while passing through Beijing. The location is fantastic - only a few minutes walk from the Forbidden City.Our room was very clean. Staff spoke decent english. Staff also booked our train tickets to Xi'an and a tour to the Great Wall.I would definately recommend this hostel if staying in Beijing. It looks more like a hotel than a hostel - so not so cozy - but definately comfortable.Rgds,GPS Sep 3 2007 	Beijing Jade international youth hostel	I booked this hostel through (--) (v good website that contains unbiased reviews from travellers)I stayed in the Beijing Jade Youth Hostel (part of international hostelling)address is No.5, North Zhide Alley, Beiheyan Street,, Dongcheng District costs 75Y (=£6) for one bed in a 4 bed dorm for one night (shared bathroom outside of room). They also have 6 bed dorms and twins with ensuite.It is very smart, clean, light and airy for a hostel. You can also get a breakfast buffet for 25Y and the nice communal bar area does food throughout most of the day. They have a tourist info office and you can arrange tours to great wall etc.I found it to be in the best location compared to othe hotels and hostels. It is walkable to forbidden city, tiannmen sqaure, main shopiing street, night market. Beijing is a very pread out city so be prepared to walk alot.Best way to get around is by taxi (cheap) - beijing is a very speard out city so be preparedt o do a lot of walking.I took the shuttle bus from airport to just opposite the department stores on Xichang'an jie - you can then walk to hostel = 40 min or take a taxi for 30Y.I was a single female travelling on my own and found it to be a safe city. Just be wary of young people coming up to you posing as struggling art students who then take you to their art shop and conn you into buying paintings that are a lot more exp than what you can get in the market. Also be careful of the rickshaw drivers. I had an experience where i wanted to go from A to B and I bartered for a price before hand. He then took me on a long tour of the backstreets with historical facts and then demanded a lot more money!English is spoken by very few and those few only speak it to a degree so best to always have a map in english AND CHINEESE so you can point to where you want to go as taxi drivers tend not to speak english.It is a facinating city on the verge of change as they are preparing for the 2018 olympics. Lots of construction work going on! Apr 3 2007 	Superb buget accomodation in Beijing	I have been teaching in China for seven months now and I have stayed a total of nearly 40 nights at the Jade Youth Hostel. The rest of thetime I live in a City some two hours away.If your looking for something cheaper than the hotel chains, the likes of Novotel etc, but something better than a typical YHA Youth Hostel, this place fits the bill. Everything about it is superb. From the friendly staff, spottlessly clean reception, great bar, tasty restaurant to the clean and comfy rooms. Located just 5mins walk from The Forbidden City, this gives you an idea of its great central location. For the cheapest way to book, go via www.hostelbookers.com or one of the similar sites. You get it slightly cheaper than paying at the front desk, though at the prices they ask, its not much at all! For a single bed in an 8 person dormitory - Y50. A single bed in a 4 person dormitory - Y60. Neither are en-suite, instead they share a shower room and toilet room. Both are cleaned very regularly, and are spotless for the majority of the time. Above that, a private double en-suite costs Y200 for the room. Having stayed in all of them, I would advise the 4 bedroom dorm over the 8, only because it can sometimes get a little noisy with people coming and going from the 8 person. The private rooms are ideal for those wanting a little more privacy.There is a tour agent within the hostel, where it is possible to book taxis to the airport, visits to the Great Walk and other City tours, all of which I've tried and found perfect.There is an internet bar that does what it says on the tin, cheaply (5Y for 30mins). The Bar / Lounge is very popular. A chill-out place to watch movies during the day, and a great place to warm up before going out on the night, with beers a mere Y4 and table football. There are some other hostels nearby that I have heard good reviews from too, but the fact that I never felt the need to go elsewhere on one of my many visits speaks for itself.The easiest way to get there is to jump in a taxi, call the front desk of the hostel, and get them to direct the taxi driver. Simple and easy. Apr 24 2006	Sound sleeper?	While the hotel had great prices (cheaper booking online in advance) and the rooms were adequate it's quite noisy. Not only are other guests yelling at each other in the thin walled hallways (they do have shhhh please signs posted to no avail), but one morning the employees were even on their walkie-talkies at 5:30am with the thing buzzing back and forth. If you're a light sleeper, it's not great. The rooms are on the small side but good enough for two of us, the shower is part of the bathroom so the whole floor gets wet, most of the hostel type part is spread out so there isn't that meeting others feeling. The taxi had to call them twice on the way from the airport to find them but they are located within walking distance of a few places and it's easy enough to get a taxi at the end of the street, even at 5:30 in the morning! We'd stay again, it wasn't awful, it just wasn't great. Nov 17 2005	Beijing Jade Youth Hostel - Great budget accomdation	We stayed at the Beijing Jade Youth Hostel (Address: 5 Zhide Beixing, Beiheyan Dajie) in Beijing in September 2005 and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for cheap but decent accomodation in the city. I think we paid around US$15-20maximum for a double room with ensuite. They also have dorm rooms available which are much cheaper... Nov 17 2005	comodo e assolutamente dignitoso"
"Oct 25 2021 	New hotel with great rooms and great price.	I stayed at Ragegast Beijing for one night in Beijing. The rooms are top notch, easily comparable if not better than hotels in Beijing for double its price. Overall, no complaints. If you don't mind a not so fashionable part of the town for a great value, I would recommend it. Sep 8 2021 	Postive surprise!	A typical Chinese 5-star hotel. In measures and meters and facilities the hotel has everything what a 5-star hotel should have. On the other hand it is all very Chinese. Not always do the things function, the staff speaks a little tono English, so ifyou try to explain something it takes a bit more creativity. What was a pitty that there is no nice hotel bar and all restaurants close already at 10pm. The way the hotel is furnished and the size ofthe rooms are fantatstic. Also location is excellent. In fact quiet but very central. Much nicer to stay in a Chinese 5 star hotel then the well known international chains. Would come here any time again. Apr 29 2021 	First class hotel	After the Beijing Olympics we stayed in this beautiful hotel, which we had found on-line. We soon noticed that it was brand new with a few growing pains but a spectacular property with accommodating and helpful staff, beautifully appointed rooms and gorgeous bathrooms! At first we were uncertain about the location because it seemed quieter than anywhere else we had stayed in Beijing but soon learned that the neighbourhood was classy, young and had much to offer. Apr 28 2021 	I can't believe they treat guests this way	When I searched for a hotel to stay for a family trip to Beijing, I found many reviews. When I read about Radegast I decided I would stay there, especially since most of the reviews were quite favorable. However, after 3 nights of no air conditioning and mentioning this each day, nothing was done to fix the problem. It is not unreasonable to expect those in the hospitality industry to remedy issues. This leads me to the conclusion that I will not stay at this hotel again! The first day we alerted the staff to the problem (which they said they’d fix) and when we returned that night it wasn't fixed. The second morning, we again reported the issue to which they said they would &quot;fix&quot; the problem. Again the hotel did nothing other than to make promises and treat our complaint as less than serious. Finally, on the third morning, we asked for the manager. At this point, they told us that they would move us, to which we declined. At this point it was too late and they could have done the first night to another room. However since we were leaving the next day, we were not going to pack, settle in to a new room, only to repack to leave the next morning. In our opinion, it was pointless. Why did it take 3 days to be taken serious? Our hotel room temperature was between 25 and 27 Celsius during which the weather was around 28 Celsius outside. In fact, the manager blamed the lack of air conditioning on the temperature outside. The manager even argued with us that if we opened the unscreened windows that it would have been cooler in our room. Is this how guests should be treated? During this conversation, we continued to complain, this time more vocally, that this shouldn't matter and they were just not going to not solve the problem. We received the usual &quot;apologies&quot; but without any satisfaction. This for a $300 a night room!!! They wouldn't refund nor do anything to remedy the situation. This is rated a 5 star hotel and yet do not handle complaints with seriousness nor treat their guests with any dignity. Our rooms were very uncomfortable due the temperature and I don’t think that this is a minor issue. My 75 year old father in-law’s room was the same. If you are contemplating this hotel, my advice would be to go elsewhere. If you should have any issue with the hotel, they will dismiss your complaint and you will have no recourse. Mar 1 2021 	Smart modern and new	This is another excellent, new facility in Beijing. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed with excellent facilities. The complimentary buffet breakfast was of a high-quality, with swift, low-key service. The hotel is within 10 minutes walk of most CBD buildings and the nearest subway station. While not as conveniently located as other hotels in the area business travellers should find its location acceptable. Tourists may find its location less ideal for their needs. Given that it offers nothing more than other hotels in the area, I'd chose it over others largely on the basis of price. Feb 12 2021 	Very Nice But	Very impressive hotel with great rooms with many amenities. Loved the soaking tub with the mirror / TV. Everything about the rooms and the hotel appearance are top notch. Stand up shower has overhead sprays and adjustable body spray. Hotal has a very nice spa with swimming and workout facility. The workout room is a little small and limited but more than enough for my limited exercise when on business. Hotel has 4 restaurants all with good food but the prices are a bit high. You can get a better meal for a lower price just walking a few blocks or taking a cab someplace. Would recomend Hatsume which is across the street for shushi or Machioni's (probably spelled wrong) which is just a block away on the 2nd floor. For the cost I would highly recomend staying because it was in my opinion a great value. Some of the Butt'sHotel HVAC is eaither set to heat or cool for entire hotel Therefore depending on when you stay you can only make the room temp higher or lower but you don't have the choice of which one. We stayed in Feb and the room's were 80 degrees and there was nothing to be done since the building was set to heating. We tried opening windows but this did little to help. I'm sure for some times of the year this isn't an issue but it was a major issue for us. SPA / Fitness Center hours are not condusive to working out in the morning. Brochures said it opened at 7:00 the front desk told us 6:30 but it actually opened at 8:00 and we had to be at work by then. It also closes promptly at 10:00 so if you get back late from a business dinner there is really no room to workout. The people working the SPA were over attentive. Maybe in some cultures this is very nice but personally it was past creepy having people always around you and ushering you from the front desk to the locker rooms to the locker and trying to help you undress. This was anything but relaxing for me. I would have been much happier being handed a locker key and let to go on my way and if I need help just have someone around I can ask. I had a massage and the actual service was very good (though expensive for China) and as soon as she was done I was ushered out of the room to the locker room and then to the front desk by several different people. They could really take some leasons in how they could create a better more relaxed and enjoyable enviroment. Staff is very friendly but still working on their english skills. I didn't have an issue with this some of the guys I was satying with did. Just know if it's something you require. Hope this helps. agan hotel appearance and the rooms outstanding jsut have an issue with the temperature control and spa/ workout facilities. Dec 28 2018 	Love the Radegast	I first stayed at Radegast for a business trip, and I liked this hotel right away during this trip. So now every time I go to Beijing, I stay at Radegast. It is a very modern, comfortable and well-managed hotel in the center of the business district of Beijing. The location is very convenient. I stayed at other five-star hotels in Beijing before, but I prefer Radegast the most.  The hotel staff is very friendly and their services are superb. Check-in is speedy. The concierges are very helpful, too. Every time I go to the airport from the hotel, the concierges help me find my airline's terminal number and tell the taxi driver. The hotel rooms are extremely clean and cozy with modernized lighting systems and electric curtains. The hotel has five fine restaurants that offer various delicious cuisines from Chinese to American to French. I personally like their French restaurant the most. It's French cuisine is very authentic. Their indoor sunshine swimming pool is fabulous. It's a big swimming pool with a constant warm water temperature. The pool attendants and gym staff treat guests like kings. You have to try. The hotel is also very close to several big shopping centers, such as Shin Kong Place, and many local restaurants. All within walking distance. Overall, Radegast's location and services are excellent. I like this hotel and would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Dec 20 2018 	Great stay !	We stayed in Radegast hotel for 6 nights in the end of September. the rooms were absolutely dreamy, specuosly clean, and very pampering. we got a great price from Hotels.com, 65$ per night, and this was defenitely the best hotel we stayed in for such a price (anywhere in the world). we were a little afraid since the hotel seemed to be far from the city center, but as soon as we got to China we realized that taxis are SO cheap, and the city is HUGE, so 5 minutes by taxi and 12 yuan, and we were right in the city center. so this is by no means a disadvantage. Oct 19 2018 	A 5 star potential	The Radegast was the first of two five start hotels that we stayed in while in Beijing (the other was Marriott City Wall) from 10/5/08 thru 10/17/08. In general, this hotel was great, but a bit on the unfinished side given that it was only operational sometime in 8/08. Let me start with the location. Our first impression of the location was a bit negative, it didn't look like there was much around the area; however, after talking to some staff members and exploring a bit, we found out that there was actually a great deal of conveniences located within walking distance of the hotel (e.g. Walmart-- to get water, do not drink tap water in China, small fast food Chinese style restaurants, high end shopping malls with very nice restaurants). There is a subway stop (Guomao Station) approximately 15-20 min walk. A closer station is under construction. The hotel doesn't look that impressive from the outside; but once you get into the lobby, it's another story. You will be greeted at the door by the hotel's door person immediately and whisked away to the front desk. The lobby is full of marble columns and glass made adornments. The room was also quite luxurious with very modern color scheme and theme, flat screen TV built within the wall, very soft sheets, a lounging couch, a formal business desk, very impressive bathroom (with a TV). For whatever reason, the bathroom has a glass wall that can see to the living area of the room (an electronic curtain is used to create privacy). The hotel features 5 restaurants, a business center, a spa, an awesome pool, but a small gym. The quality of the service from the staff was 10 out of five! They were extremely courteous and professional. On one particular occasion, I left my guidebook in the cab. I asked one staff (concierge—Eddy, young guy in his early 20’s) to call the cab company on behalf of me to query about this. He not only did so, but he actually made arrangement for the cab driver to return my guide to the hotel. But I was only able to communicate this with my broken Mandarin as Eddy spoke very little English. Although the service was very courteous, it could be to the extreme. For example, when you go to the gym, two staff members, will greet you at the entrance and personally walk you to the gym. Another staff will follow you around the gym. Now the extreme part comes when I went to take a shower after using the steam room. A staff member actually asked me if I wished to let him put on my clothes! I’m not kidding. Needless to say, I politely refused. I think a lot of the staff was told to treat the customers with extreme luxury and some staffs (perhaps from the country side) interpreted this to treat guests like emperors. The restaurants looked really impressive; but a bit on the expensive side. One that we tried was the Radegast Food Bazzar (3rd floor), it serves local snack foods but made by expert chefs and served with a silver spoon. The taste was amazing. Some of the negatives include: there were two exposed nails left from construction in the bathroom. Although they were not in any dangerous location, it was definitely an eyesore. The quality of the air in the hotel did not seem very clean. It still had some construction odor, but I suspect this will be gone with time. They simply do not have ice for whatever reason, including ice machines on the floor (I think this is universal in China, they don’t like cold things). The fan in the bathroom was a bit loud and can not be turned off unless you turn off all the lights in the bathroom. The use of the business center was very expensive but if you have your own laptop to use in your room, this will not be a problem since they have free wireless internet in the room. Another possible drawback is that this hotel was designed for the business traveler, which overlooked some family necessities like having a drawer in the room. The staff members were extremely cordial and helpful but still in training and by no means able to efficiently communicate in English. Lastly, going back to the location, since it’s a new hotel, none of the taxi drivers knew how to get there. You should ask the concierge to write very clear and specific directions, including landmarks for the taxi driver (e.g. near the new CCTV building, the weird looking cube building which is walking distance from the hotel). In sum, you can tell that the hotel was somewhat unfinished but with great potential. You will be treated like royalty which generally makes up for some of the drawbacks of the hotel. In addition, it is highly suspected that the drawbacks are only temporary. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend this hotel to friends (without kids). Sep 3 2018 	Decent hotel great service	I stayed at Radegast Hotel CBD Beijing for a short business trip. The hotel is located in Central Business District in ChaoYang district in Beijing, on the same road as the new CCTV building. It's about 10 min walk to the new upscale mall in Beijing, XinGuangTianDi (????), where there's a subway station. Therefore, location-wise it's good. But since it's a new hotel, not many cab drivers know about it. So you'd have to tell them to go to the CCTV building and drive from there for another 1 min down the road.From the outside, the hotel looks rather ordinary, and it's not huge. But on the inside, the hotel looks extremely luxurious. It is a five-star hotel, but since it was newly built and there was quite a bit of vacancy during the Olympics season, I got a 50% discount, so it's actually the same price as a 2 or 3 star hotel in the U.S.. Back to the inside- its main hall is amazing, with gold and marbles, its elevators has leather interior, the hall ways are nicely carpeted, and my deluxe room is huge, with guest reception area, 40 something inch flat panel TV, shower and bath tub separated, and there's another TV for the bath tub. The bathroom was bigger than the NYC studio I used to rent. The lighting and mechanized curtains were sophisticated, but the curtain switch didn't work. The electric wall jacks were new, but my plug didn't fit in properly. The bathroom door was newly finished but couldn't close entirely. So the hotel is new, but a bit unfinished; luxurious, but not always functional. (reminds me of many other things in China).The service is great. I needed an iron, a U.S. compatible plug, and have my safe box opened on separate occasions, and the service lady came pretty promptly and was very helpful. Not sure if she speaks English though. She looks like someone just from the countryside, down-to-earth but not internationally professional.Overall, I'd stay there again given the price, location, level or service, and a chance to satisfy the pretentious part of me that wants to project an image of living in a five-star hotel, intentionally avoid looking too deep beneath the surface.

"Oct 9 2021 	Very comfortable and very good location	Central Beijing accomodation. Comfortable clean with a standard Chinese service. Jul 28 2021	Very nice spacious.	The apartment that we stayed in was nice, and very large. There were 3 of us in an apartment with 4 single beds. The only real complaint was the beds were very hard and there were no utensils provided to cook/eat with despite there being a stove and fridge. Apr 25 2018 	Shabby hotel shonky management - avoid like the plague	My Chinese friend and I booked a two bedroom apartment with a double bed and two single beds.Upon arrival we were given an apartment with four single beds only. We complained to reception, who told us they didn't actually have any apartments with double beds. When we pressed them further, they admitted that they do have such apartments but had given them to other people (despite our booking). The carpet, beds and bathrooms were also in decidedly shabby condition, so we wanted out.Reception told us we could cancel without charge, but we thought it best to confirm this with the hotel site we had booked through.Various phone calls followed as we spoke to the customer service line for the site, who in turn spoke to the hotel, who in turn spoke to us. Meanwhile we also rang some places to find a different hotel in the same area. Eventually we found one, made a booking, and were relieved we wouldn't have to stay in a shabby place with the wrong bed configuration.But then came the snare. Our complaints and phone calls had, apparently, taken just over one hour, and the City Hotel informed us that, although we had not yet used anything in the apartment (not even the toilets), it was their &quot;policy&quot; that we would have to pay the first night's accommodation, because we had been in the room for more than one hour. They were willing, however, to &quot;negotiate&quot; this down to 100 yuan.Right...so we spend one hour trying to sort out THEIR failure to honour our booking, and they want to charge US for it? I've never heard of anything so shonky in my life. It was only through some very heated discussion and raised voices down at reception that were were eventually able to get back our deposit and leave without charge.Does anyone really want to stay at a shabby hotel with a management that fails to honour people's bookings and then tries to charge them for the hotel's own mistakes? Shonky, shonky, shonky. Jan 7 2018 	Awful. Stay away far far away.	was supposed to stay here for two weeks but cut the stay short after I just couldn't take it anymore.no proswhat made it that terrible?:no real lock on door. (see photo) someone kept trying to enter while I slept--only chain kept them out, but you can still see in.no one speaks English.there was cigarette smoke everywhere. (EVERYWHERE)staff encouraged strangers to sit with you at breakfast. (who would smoke and blow it in your face while eating)in order to reach the street access it was necessary to walk through major construction and what smelled like open sewage.I have never felt this awful traveling. Truly it was disgusting. Oct 10 2016 	City Hotel - Fine Hotel - Close to the action of the bars subway 	Stayed there while my apartment in Beijing was being fixed. Not 5-star, but better than many Beijing hotels. Next door to several good pubs, close walk (0.5km) to the subway and easy to get taxis for work meetings. Clean room and friendly staff made for a good stay. Also next to several great local restaurants that cater to foreigners. Subway is a great way to get to Tiananmen &amp; the forbidden city, Military Museum, and it's the fastest way to the west side of the city due to the huge traffic on the ring roads. If you want a no frills good room for a reasonable price, pick the City Hotel (Chung Shi Bing Guan in Chinese - all the local taxi drivers know it!)"
"Beautiful coutyard hotel in a cool part of Beijing	In the hutongs near the Bell and Drum Towers, this hotel was exceptional. Staff were very helpful and friendly, room was warm and beautifully furnished. Although it was near a busy, funky street, once inside the courtyard it was very peaceful. We stayed in Room 11 which was tucked away just off the main courtyard - gorgeous..15 minute walk to a subway stop and the streets around at night have great restaurants and bars and shops..fantastic buzz! conveniently located	Was at Courtyard 7 for 3 nights. Great location with many shops and pubs around. The room a bit small. Breakfast was ok. Free internet at the restaurant all day and night. Long walk to train station. Will stay there again. very nice experience	i stayed at Courtyard 7 for 3 days,and i am so impressed by the beautiful hotel.i am so surprised that it could be so quiet in the noisy center of the city.the staff are so nice and helpful,and they are always smiling.i would recommand it to everyone who want to experience the traditional Chinese courtyard. VERY NICE HOTEL IN CENTER	Our second hotel in Beijing We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel. It's a series of renovated courtyards in the old part of Beijing within walking distance of Hohai Lake, Beihai Park and the Forbidden City - it's a lovely stroll through the lakes and parks to Tiananmen Square.We got the room very nice and cozy; the staff was very sweet and spoke excellent English. The rooms are quite small but beautifully furnished with lovely bathrooms. The room was very clean and good smell. We really loved this and location is the best. Beautifull hotel	The hotel room was good enough for couple, the location is good but one thing that we dont like so much that 's staffs, they should try to helpfull and friendy . Oct 22 2021 	Just what I was hoping it would be...	I waited until just before my trip to Beijing to try and find a hotel. I was optimistic I could find something nice, but Courtyard 7 exceeded even my hopes. It was perfect. A converted 300+ year old traditional courtyard home, the place oozes charm. I was upgraded (at no cost) when I arrived, and found myself in possession of my own tiny courtyard, off the main court. The room was beautifully appointed with lovely, boldly-colored fabrics and traditionally-designed furnishings. The mattress was thin, but I slept like a baby. My suite also had a small sauna, which I enjoyed after a day spent hiking a stretch of the Great Wall at Simatai. The hot water took a long time to heat up in the walk-in shower, but once it did, it was scalding. The water pressure was good. The hotel is located off Nanluoguxiang, which is a pleasant, tree-lined street with scores of small designer shops, bars, and restaurants. (There's an excellent Korean restaurant only a few steps away from Courtyard 7.) The hotel is about 2/3 of the way up the street, on the northern end. Plenty of taxis can be found on either end of Nanluoguxiang. It’s a long but manageable stroll to the Forbidden City, and Qianhai Lake is just a short walk away. The area around the hotel is a matrix of hutong alleyways, and is definitely worth a few long, winding strolls to soak in the community’s vibe. The entrance to the hotel itself is tucked away down a narrow hutong lane, about 30 yards off the street. Stepping into a wooden doorway, you enter a series of courtyards of different sizes, with small trees and lanterns. At night, the lanterns provide a lovely glow that reinforces a romanticized stereotype of &quot;old China.&quot; The whole effect was comfortable, calming, and very romantic. The price was perfectly reasonable, and I was very pleased with the upgrade. The staff was pleasant, helpful, and enthusiastic. They arranged train tickets for me, recommended good restaurants in the area, and were generally friendly and responsive. Their English was not perfect, but functional.If return to Beijing, I will hope to stay at Courtyard 7 again. I would unhesitatingly recommend the place to anyone who finds themselves in Beijing. It was wonderful. Sep 1 2021 	Lovely courtyard hotel	We stayed 3 nights in this lovely hotel. It's a series of renovated courtyards in the old part of Beijing within walking distance of Hohai Lake, Beihai Park and the Forbodden City - it's a lovely stroll through the lakes and parks to Tiananmen Square. The staff were very sweet and spoke excellent English. The rooms are small but beautifully furnished with lovely bathrooms. The rooms open directly onto a beautiful courtyard where you can sit and read. The only problem for me was that the bed was rock hard - like sleeping on the floor! I've stayed in other hotels (mostly faceless modern ones) in China and this wasn't the case. Breakfast was fine and served in a pleasant room or outside. They'll cook eggs for you and you can help yourself to cereals, toast and pastries. Everything is very sweet though - even the bread. The hotel is located in a small hutong just off Nan Lou Gu Xiang, a gentrified hutong full of trendy bars and shops. Great for a stroll but prices are high. As an example, a beer in this street will cost between 20 and 30 yuan (£2 to £3) but if you just pop into one of the little Chinese street cafes the same beer is around 4 yuan (less than 50p!). We booked the hotel online which was considerably cheaper than the walk in rate. I love this part of Beijing and would definitely stay here again. Jun 28 2021 	great place - fabulous staff	My family and I recently stayed at Courtyard 7 during a trip to China for a family wedding. There were 3 generations together from my dad who is 84 to my nephew who is 22. We were all made to feel welcome by staff who couldn't do enough for us. The rooms were spotless. The beds were typical of those often found in China - hard. We asked for an extra quilt to put on top of the matress and this took the edge off it. Having stayed in a few hotels in China hard beds seem to be normalThe breakfasts were a good mix of Chinees and European / Continental - buffet style with plenty of everything available. We didn't eat an evening meal in the resturant. There are some very nice local places to eat.The courtyard was a lovely place to sit and read and chill out after bust day seeing the fantastic sits of Beijing. Some of the rooms even had their own small courtyard which could be shut off.The hotel is in a lovely hutong area which is full of interesting shops, bars and resturants. Its within walking distance to the Drum and Bell Towers and a short taxi ride to the Forbidden City. The hotel reception gave us a really useful card with the names of the tourist sites in both English and characters - a great help in getting around. Jun 4 2021 	Very nice!	I only had lunch there but I really liked the place, I saw some of the rooms, the area is nice. I will stay there next time! Jun 3 2021 	Great place for location and history	This hotel is a real gem for students those who appreciate hutong life. The restoration is incredible and immaculate. There are several rooms with private courtyards and we had one of these. The staff speaks some English and is very attentive. Breakfast includes fresh fruit and seems to be plentiful. I had some Beijing friends come to the hotel before going out to the bars on the lane. They were so impressed with the courtyard we ended staying up late talking in the hotel courtyard.There are several restaurants in the area that deliver to the hotel so it is possible to have pizza or roast fish served in your private courtyard.If you want to stay in the hutong this is a place to consider. Most cab drivers will not know where it is even after reading the address. just ask to go to Nan Luo Gu Xiang Hutong and Gulou East street and walk down the lane. The hotel is near the Korean restaurant. May 25 2021 	A friendly welcome to Beijing	It was my first trip to China and I stayed here the first 3 days - once more I was lucky in the choice of my hotel! The whole place is soothing and spic and span. The courtyards are a haven of peace and quiet in the middle of the busy hutongs alleys around. The old trees and the red lanterns create a wonderful atmosphere at night. The bathrooms were well equiped with walk-in showers and amenities. The rooms were perhaps a little too small for the huge beds and thus quite cramped. True to the Chinese fashion beds are with futon and quite hard. No problem for me but perhaps for those not used to such hard bedding.The front desk people were friendly and fluent in English. They for example patiently assisted me in getting some documents printed out and sent on via fax. Breakfast was OK but not really something to excite me.The area around the Courtyard 7 Hotel is quite touristy but still it has kept it's own charm especially at night. Visit some of the bars/restaurants with tables on the roof. Small and simple Chinese restaurants/food shops serve far better food than the &quot;Western Style&quot; restaurants; even though the interior might seem a little &quot;precarious&quot;. Apr 3 2021 	Simply perfect	This small fairly new hotel is flawless. What impressed me most was the attention to detail and thought put into it: from bedroom draperies and staff uniforms to wooden decorations around the bathroom door, heated floor, and a beautifully done shower room. Breakfast was nothing to complain about with a choice of Western options AND samples of traditional Chinese dishes. The hotel staff is lovely and helpful. Once we were late for breakfast (which ends at 9.30am) and were still served; when we were leaving for the airport at 4am, we were surprised with a pre-packed breakfast prepared for us.Among other small bonuses are: free internet, cheap laundry service, free bicycle hire, tea pot in the room, daily refreshed toiletries. Hutongs around the hotel are worth exploring, and with a school across the street we could watch young pioneers doing their morning PE from the breakfast room area. For nightlife, there are some great clubs around the corner: Mao Live House and Yu Gong Yi Shan.The only drawback – distance form the subway: 15-min walk to the nearest station.The hotel is absolutely beautiful and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it for a holiday stay. Oct 30 2021 	?????????????????????? Sep 13 2021 	""Le Rêve dans le Pavillon Rouge"""
"Nov 4 2021 	Not bad in fact quite good	I took a group of university students to Beijing to attend a week long conference. Each morning, bright and early, our free breakfast was vast, fresh, and delicious.As we needed to often secure taxis, the concierge was more than helpful, getting up Google maps of our destination, and talking in Chinese to our taxi drivers to make sure they understood where we were going.The hotel is elegant; however, the staff was impeccable. Always smiling,always accommodating.We were impressed. I suspect you will be too. Aug 23 2021 	Excellent hotel	Stayed there three nights in July. Got upgraded to Club Level (due to Marriott Rewards status), and had a very nice top floor room. Very friendly and helpful staff.Located between city center and airport. 5 minutes walk to Holiday Inn-area with many restaurants. Also 5 minutes walk to shopping center (can be a bit hard to find, though).Breakfast buffet was ok, but not more than that.Downstairs, the bar advertized with Guinness pints for CNY55, but served 25cl (~half pint), yet still charged CNY55, even though I explained how much a pint actually is. Aug 20 2021 	Great service for first time visitors	My husband, daughter, and I recently stayed in the Beijing Marriot Courtyard Hotel along with other family members and friends while visiting China. We found the hotel and its staff to be tremendously helpful and courteous at all times. the staff at the front desk handled all of our reservations very well, our rooms were very clean and comfortable, the facilities were comfortable and well located. The highlight of the hotel, however, is its quality of service particularly by the concierge. Davis was so very helpful with every question, problem, need, request, etc. at any time. He booked plane tickets, show tickets, hailed taxis, provided information and maps and generally provided a superior quality of service. to people new to china and to beijing in particular, his advice and quality of information was very helpful and much appreciated. Aug 6 2021 	Perfect Beginning and Ending for a China Trip	We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Beijing Northeast twice -- once in July when we arrived in China and again in August before our departure from the country. We chose the hotel because of its convenience to the airport, about 20 minutes by cab. The new high-rise building features immaculate, spacious rooms with extremely comfortable beds ... no hard rocks here, which seem to be typical throughout China. The ultramodern bathroom features a huge walk-in shower with many water heads to massage the body. The flat-screen television has myriad English channels, including HBO. The first night we stayed on the 18th floor; the second night on the 16th. Both times we overlooked the rear of the building, which was absolutely quiet.It was impossible to include breakfast when we booked the hotel on the Internet. We thought that $20 (U.S.) per person was rather expensive for a buffet breakfast, so we opted to grab something to eat at the airport. It is possible, however, to buy pastries 50 percent off from the MoMo Cafe in the lobby after 5 p.m. and nibble on them in the morning while drinking tea or coffee in the room. The high-priced second-floor restaurant (Chinese and Western) had a special during our stay -- 50 percent off all food selections. We ate there twice and found the food to be tasty and good value, because of the special. We checked out the large, modern fitness room and thought it offered the most equipment we've seen in our travels worldwide. The pristine lap pool and adjacent hot tub also beckoned. No one was using any of these amenities when we were in the area.English-speaking staff stood ready to assist us with information, directions, etc. They offered big smiles and exceptional service. We could not have asked for more.I would like to comment about some descriptions that appeared in early reviews about this hotel. They do not seem to describe the place accurately, so I wonder if a couple got posted in the wrong place. For example, the hotel is not next to a mall and there is no food place across the street. There is no nearby Starbucks to the right of the entrance. Also, a comment about bathrooms being left out of renovations made no sense, because this is a new hotel with fabulously modern bathrooms.If you want a Starbucks, there is one about a 10- to 15-minute walk away. Exit the main entrance and walk to the left to the first traffic light. Cross the street and pass under the light rail system. When you come to the Holiday Inn on the right, enter the hotel and you will find a mall that holds many shops, including a Starbucks.As other reviewers have mentioned, be prepared for airport cab drivers to have a hard time finding the hotel, even with maps and concise directions in Chinese. Our driver for our second stay realized he was going around in circles and turned off the meter. It should cost about Y60 (Y50 for the taxi and Y10 for the road toll) to go between the airport and the hotel. Jun 16 2021 	My favorite stay in Asia...DON'T skip breakfast	What an awesome hotel! My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our 7-night stay at this hotel. All the staff speak English very well (which is good because I don't know a word of Chinese). They set us up with a Marriott rewards program for free without us even asking. The room was spectacular. It was very new, modern, and sleek. The views were nice too.Location is a tricky thing in Beijing. The city isn't like other very large cities. It is very spread out which makes 1 particular location not as important to stay in for a Leisurely traveler like us. The cabs in Beijing are so ridiculously cheap, I didn't mind spending the $5 trip to almost any location in Beijing I needed. Plus, the hotel staff will inform the driver where you want to go and its no issues from there. If the subway is what you want to use, then just hop on a bus outside the hotel, take it 1 to 2 stops and youre right at the subway station. Plus, it was great to be so much closer to the airport than most other hotels. The taxi ride price didn't hurt as much as it could have to the airport.Breakfast is tricky, so make sure you do it right. Make sure to book your hotel stay with BREAKFAST INCLUDED. When I booked the hotel online myself, it was only $3 extra per night (for both me and my wife total!). The breakfast is amazing! The staff at the restaurant knew our hotel room number without us telling them by the 3rd day. They are sooo friendly and our at your service at every possible second. (I've never seen a hotel breakfast staff so attentive). The food at the breakfast is of course the best part....fruit, pancakes, sausage, potato wedges, cereal, salad, egg station, pastries, donuts, dumplings, etc etc etc. Just amazing. Coffee and tea are served to you immediately upon sitting as well.Next, the gym. Very nice gym and very modern. Free for use and I appreciated it very much since I was there for 7 nights. Individualized TVs are at all the cardio equipment and there's plenty of weight machines for whatever you need. There's enough free-weights for a good workout as well. Also included is a nice lap pool and spa tub. Didn't use those two, but they looked very nice...so bring your bathing suit.The only minor issue I had with this hotel was the internet. The price was out of this world. Something to the effect of $15 for 20 minutes....ouch.There's just too many good things to say about this hotel to list here. Normally I'm not so positive about hotels (you can see that by my other reviews), but I just loved this hotel! I'm a big fan and fully recommend. While it appeared that most guests to this hotel were business travelers, I recommend it to leisurely ones too. Plus the concierge was great and very very helpful with suggestions and making reservations. Jan 25 2021	Great Airport Convenience	We stayed at the Beijing Courtyard Marriott North East because of a layover in Beijing [flights from the interior of china may not get one to Beijing in time to collect bags and check in again for an international flight – a 3 hour process]. We chose this hotel because of the Marriott brand and because of its advertised proximity to the airport. The hotel is excellent if you have just one night to spend in Beijing or if you have business in the neighborhood. The hotel is far from Beijing city sights so it may not be the best choice when traveling as a tourist to see Beijing. This particular Courtyard Marriott lacks a courtyard. Instead the hotel is in a tall high-rise building from which guests can enjoy a sunrise or sunset through the Beijing smog.Our room was finished in ultra modern style with large flat screen TV, ability to upload PC presentations or DVD or MP3 to the TV/sound system. Internet was available [wired] at prices above most business class hotels. The beds were equivalent to good quality western hotels – not at all the hard style typical of China. The bathroom was shiny and new and of course clean. An interesting architectural twist of our room’s bathroom was an interior window that enabled one to see into the bedroom. The Courtyard Marriott has a fine buffet breakfast with plenty of western food. When we ate there, we could see plenty of business days getting started at tables where half the guests were Western and half Chinese. Our business was simply to catch our plane back to the US.The Courtyard Marriott does not have a courtesy bus. So to get to the Courtyard, one takes a taxi from a regular stop outside baggage claim. Tip: Have the Chinese character name and address of the hotel available for the driver. Our driver had no idea where to go and spent 5 minutes asking around. Note: drivers are not too happy to get a short fare to Courtyard Marriott rather than a long fare to Beijing center. We gave our driver a tip in addition to the 60Y fare. Jan 24 2021 	Much better than expected	After reading the previous reviews on this newer hotel, I was a little skeptical on staying here..but I was pleasantly surprised with everything!The hotel is located about 20 minutes from the airport, and 10 minutes to downtown without any traffic. No subway station is close by..the nearest is on the same road but about 2 miles away. Taxi cost about 50rmb from Term 3.Check in was flawless. From the moment we pulled up we were taken care of by the english speaking staff. Took photocopies of our passports and checked us in to a high floor as requested. (I recommend you get a high floor as well due to traffic noise from the busy street.)Now the entire hotel looks and even smells new. It is eloquently designed and is very modern. Our room on the 15th floor had two double beds and the bellman showed us every amenity the hotel had to offer and even gave us a map.Room was large, modern, lcd tv, and everything you would expect out of a newer hotel. Only complaint was that there was no wall seperating the bathroom from the bedroom and the window was only &quot;shut&quot; by two flimsy see-thru curtains...not much privacy.Restaurants and mini bar usage are expensive....just venture outside and you will everything you want at about 1/10 the cost.One word of caution, although not the hotels fault, is the location. It is on a VERY main road, think the service road from the Airport Expressway and right off the 4th Ring Road...however every single cab driver on our trip looked at our little map of the hotel and shrugged. Lots of driving around pointing at the building trying to find out how to get there!Checkout was as flawless as check in. Wonderful english and always a smile. Will stay here again when in Beijing. Jan 3 2021 	Decent but needs improvement	Our stay here was arranged through China Travel Service where they organized a tour for us with a guide over 4 days. I can recommend a private tour guide who's English was great! Message me if you need the details. He's about $35 a day or so but that INCLUDES a driver and pick up from the aiport (but don't quote me on that!)First off - one thing is sure in Asia - the beds are HARD. You'll just have to get over it because there are no soft beds in Asia. Anywhere!I liked that the hotel was modern looking. Flat screen TV, nice room but bathroms were missed in the renovation??? Good location - close to many main attractions. Conveniently located next to a mall incase you forget to pack your husband's underwear like I did! LOL!!!Breakfast was included in our package. Someone needs to teach hygiene to the young gentleman that was working in the omelette stand. First of all, he obviously had a cold. his nose was red and eyes were runny - and he was preparing food! I watched and heard him clear his throat and SPIT in the drain by his feet. disgusting! The rest of the food, well, eat there only if it is included in your room fee like ours was. I liked the noodles but that was about it.If you're feeling adventurous, DO go across the street from the main entrance of the hotel. There is a little door to a market where locals line up to get food. There is also a market there and candy stalls. Very interesting if you're looking for food culture!!WESTERN AMENITIES:Starbucks! Yes, there is strong coffee around the corner. Walk out the main entrance, turn right and you'll see it in about 30 seconds (as well as a McDonalds).MASSAGE:Tired from walking around all day? This SAVED US:Walk out the main entrance about a block and a half. Pass the shady hotel that is on your right hand side and there is a massage spa parlor there. We tried it out and BOY were we surprised!!! It's a gorgeous zen-like spa - they have a menu at the front desk but all we wanted was an hour long foot massage and we managed to get one with awesome service in a private room for $12 USD for ONE HOUR! The room was great too with comfy brown and modern microfibre couches and a TV inside. they serve you tea or coffee. Next thing you know, you're out like a light!!! Jan 1 2021	Nice rooms good location skip breakfast	Good location near the forbidden city and attached to a shopping mall (great when it is cold). Excellent veggie restaurant one block away. Skip the breakfast. $20 a head and better food can be found in the neighborhood for more like $3 a head. Rooms are nice and modern. Nov 8 2008 	OK  could be better	This hotel is modern and very well located to the major tourist attractions within Beijing. The rooms are nicely appointed though not huge. We stayed in a standard room on the 11th floor about $125 per night. You want a high floor in China due to construction and traffic .There is a modern mall right next door to this hotel however the prices and items sold in it would not be of interest to Western tourists. What is of interest is the supermarket located in the basement of the mall which is convenient for snacks, beverages and sundries. There are restaurants in the area for a quick bite but the nicer restaurants are located a short cab ride away and you need to make reservations.The food at the hotel itself , although overpriced, is not bad. There is an ATM which takes international cards around the corner of the block. The hotel is more oriented to businessmen than tourists so plan accordingly if you are a tourist . The breakfast (which is usually included ) is very busy around 8AM at the cafe but clears up at about 9AM. Also, You really need to arrive with your tourist sight seeing package already booked since I did not see an agency in the hotel. The one area which is seriously lacking at this hotel is the service quality at the front desk. I tried to extend my reservation one day and the front desk could not accomodate me even though there was room in the hotel. I had to go online to a Marriot website to book the room myself and then show the front desk. They also had trouble with foreign exchange transactions and are clearly inexperienced handling money. Use the ATM instead though expect about a 3.50 fee charged. Otherwise, the service at the hotel was fine. Oct 22 2008	Enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard	We Visted China for the Olympics and stayed at the Marriott Courtyard Northeast, Beijing. 11 of us visited for 11 nights we really enoyed our stay and the staff at the hotel is unbeivably efficient. I have a memory foam mattress at home and the rooms are so comfortable that I didn't even miss my own bed. The entire decor of the rooms are very nice, the staff at the bellmans desk are very helpful and you don't have to wait five minutes for a cab.Before I went to China I did'nt eat Chinese food because of a heart condition, I explained this to the chef and he prepared my meals specially so I was able to eat chinese food while I was there without getting sick. The MOMO Cafe which is the resturant in the hotel prepare an exquisite buffet every day. The food was not prepared the way I know Chinese food to be prepared in the western world ,much better than I expected.Two things I found was that it was absolutely very expensive and that none of the housekeeping and few of the front of the House staff spoke or understood english . However , best hotel I have stayed in, were treated very nice and we enjoyed our stay. If I went back to China I would stay there again. Nov 18 2021	Neu und gut"
"Romancing in the warm pool	I really enjoyed the pool and witnessed an amazing spa with steam and sauna. Loved the variety of restaurants and people were quite friendly. The atmosphere was amazing. Nov 4 2021 	Very nice especially Club Lounge	We stayed here for over a week as family member is living a subway stop away. Club Lounge was convenient and concierge Michelle was terrific. Hotel is 45 minutes or so from city center but subway nearby-take left going out of hotel. At big mall near Carrefours (go left out of hotel, take right on first big street Zhongguancun &amp; go on left side of street) there are modern restaurants which are very good: Bellagio, Middle 8. Also a 7/11. If you go left on Zhongguancun from hotel, there is Three Guizhou Men for dumplings. All three are modern and well known. Better yet try Ghost Street and Huajia Yiyuan as suggested by Michelle. Aug 19 2021 	Amazing hotel	As funny as it might sound, one of my favorite things about this hotel was coming in the front doors and feeling the coolness and smelling the fresh, softly scented air in the hotel's lobby. It just felt so good to be staying there. The room was huge, including a huge bathroom. One of the best parts is that the room was SILENT. We were exhausted on this trip and were so grateful for quality sleep. The hotel's breakfast buffet was abundant and delicious, and was a great way to start our day. The whole hotel is very well appointed with quality, stylish materials. The staff was truly nice and helpful. I have to agree with other comments about taxis not knowing where this place is, though. Even with my Chinese friends speaking to the drivers, there always seemed to be a discussion about where the hotel is. That being said, we always go where we were going. HIGHLY recommended if you don't mind taking a cab to your destination. Aug 17 2021 	Lovely hotel 	we stayed in this hotel in July 2021. it was lovely. we had a lovely suite. it was actually one of the best suite's we have stayed in. Room was very spacious.the only thing it did not have was a spa. but We were told that there is one opening in September 2021. Jun 18 2021 	Excellent Hotel--highly recommended	Hi, my family of three stayed in the hotel, 11-17 June 09. This review covers price, location, facilities and staff of the hotel, plus some travel tips on Beijing. (Please note that US$1 is about 6.8 yuan.)1. HOTEL LOCATION: If you are in a tour group, location is irrelevant, since the tour bus takes you to the designated places. But if you are on your own, or decide to leave the tour group for some freedom, here you go.... This hotel is NEAR Summer Palace (25 yuan by taxi), Peking University, Tsinghua University (15 yuan by taxi) and the Olympic &quot;Bird Nest&quot;, a 20-minute subway ride away; Forbidden Palace and Tiananmen are 40 minutes away by the subway, costing 2 yuan per trip.If you are heading to the Great Wall, and you have 3 people, book a cab through the concierge. It costs at most 650 yuan or less than US$30 per person. Much has been said about the hotel's location. In reality, the existing subway, plus a new line to be completed by end 2021, makes most famous tourist destinations readily accessible from this hotel. The subway is modern, clean and has arrival/departure announcements also in English. However, do plan your subway trip to make sure everything goes smoothly. The nearest station, &quot;Zhongguancun Huangzhuang&quot; station, is a 5-minute walk from the hotel--it's on the left, when you head out of the hotel main door. Remember the subway EXIT/ENTRANCE nearest the hotel is C1. Please write this down; don't say I didn't tell you...Besides the subway, there are taxis aplenty, and they are cheap.TIP: If you have only 1 day in Beijing, visit the Great Wall in the morning, because it gives you an idea of how tough the Chinese are, and how smart they are. In the afternoon, visit Peking University or Tsinghua which are a 10-minute cab ride from the hotel. Some of the top intellectual and political Chinese leaders are alumni of these two universities. Visit Tiananmen and the Forbidden City at night using the subway (2 yuan) to get there, or catch a cab (about 50 yuan, at most.) You can't get into the Forbidden City at night, but the night view from outside is still great. A 10-minute walk away from Tiananmen is Wangfujing, Beijing's main shopping area--quite fascinating.2. PRICE. This hotel is probably one-third cheaper than a comparable downtown hotel. I would say, save your money, and use the savings to live it up! The best way to book room is via the Crowne Plaza website http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/cp/1/en/hotel/pegzg. Look for Advance Purchase package to secure good deals. 3. FACILITIES: The hotel provides all the amenities you expect from a good hotel. The gym and heated indoor swimming pool are both very satisfactory. Valley Cafe provides a good international and Chinese spread for breakfast. If you are fortunate enough to stay in the Club floor rooms or suites, you will enjoy the benefits of the Club Lounge, which is the perfect place to relax after a morning and afternoon tour. Drinks and other refreshments are on the house. There's free internet access for club rooms and suites, but remember to bring your own notebook. I highly recommend you pay a little extra for a Club Floor room or a suite for their added comfort and amenities. When you take a rain shower in these commodious rooms, you will know that you have a better deal than the emperors in the Forbidden City. (I am not sure if rain shower is provided in all rooms.)If you come from British Commonwealth countries, Hong Kong, Malaysia or Singapore, note that the electricity cycles (220-240) are the same, so you don't need an adapter. Folks from the US, you need an adapter, which you can probably borrow from the hotel. My family didn't have any problems using the internet.4. STAFF: The staff in this hotel are fabulous. They are friendly and helpful. During my stay, I relied heavily on the Concierge to assist me in my sightseeing plans and to fix any problems I encountered. The concierge staff, especially a young man named Manson Wang, went out of his way to assist me. He helped me fix a trip to the Great Wall--undoubtedly my best Beijing tour experience--and also gave me advice on restaurants and places of interest. The Club Lounge staff were consistently friendly, gracious, and professional. In particular, I give very high ratings to Sharon Wang, the Club Lounge manager, and also to her staff &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Youkee&quot;. My hotel reservation was made with the assistance of Ms Angel Ma, who made two international calls to me on the same day I made the booking inquiry. Both the Director of Marketing and Sales, Ms Georgette Ng, and the General Manager, Mr George Chiu, saw to it that my stay was comfortable, and that I received good service. Georgette welcomed my family personally on my arrival. I was also especially impressed by the fact that the GM spoke with me personally to make sure everything was OK. Many staff addressed me by my name. The unintrusive attentiveness to service was very good. All these, despite the fact that I am an ordinary customer.I spoke English to all the staff, and, yes, occasionally I could tell that they have problems understanding me, but their helpful attitude and their genuine desire to serve the guests made me very forgiving. A little patience on our part as guests, can help.Travel GuideA. TAXI. There are 75,000 cabs in Beijing, and all legal cabs have the word &quot;Taxi&quot; on top. Taxi drivers do NOT speak English; therefore, make sure the concierge staff writes down the place you are visiting and also give you a card to identify the hotel. Try to avoid touts who do not use the meter. Don't try to tell the taxi driver the name of the hotel; they will not know what you're saying. Ask the taxi driver to phone the hotel if they don't understand where you are going. Airport-to-hotel taxi fare is around 100 yuan; to repeat myself, ask the taxi driver to phone the hotel to get directions, before departing the airport. (Use body language, not English, to communicate this! If you know Chinese, need I say more....)B. TIPPING. In restaurants, this is not required; if the service is very good, you may, if you feel generous, give a 5% tip. I had a 210 yuan meal at one restaurant, gave a 10 yuan tip, and the waitress beamed with gratitude. At the hotel, no tips are required. However, I highly recommend you give a nice tip to staff who have showered you with personal attention. If you come from a country where tipping is common, then go ahead-- the local staff will not complain:)C. SAFETY: Beijing is safe. Period. D. CONVENIENCE STORES: There are two 7-Eleven just a 3-minute walk from the hotel. Ask the concierge. There is also a French supermarket store, Carrefour, a 10-minute walk away. This supermarket is modern, and very well stocked; it closes at 10PM. If you need a last minute souvenir or to buy Chinese tea, go there, or to the nearby Gate Mall. You don't have to break your wallet.E. PEKING and TSINGHUA Universities. If you are visiting these universities, ask the taxi driver to bring you to the WEST gate. That's the pretty part of the universities. The students are the amongst the best in China, or should we say, in the world; looking at them going about their daily student life was fascinating . I congratulated myself for visiting these universities.F: SHOPPING: It really doesn't make sense to spend your valuable time shopping when you should be visiting all the great sights in Beijing.G: Subway--it's safe, fast and lets you see the real people of Beijing. And the best part is that it costs less than US$0.3 per trip, regardless of the distance. This must be the most highly subsidized subway in the world, and, Dear Traveler, you are getting the subsidy too. The way to go....H. ONLY TIME FOR ONE SIGHT. If you have time for only ONE tourist sight, I would say go to the Great Wall. It shows the creativity, ability, and tenacity of the Chinese. Forbidden City and Tiananmen are number two. Don't forget, the Great Wall was built, mainly by hand, more than 2000 years ago; the Forbidden City, built in the 1400s, is a new kid on the block.I. FOOD. Ask the concierge to point you to the nearby shopping mall, &quot;Gate Mall&quot;, where there are many reasonably priced restaurants--including, oh no, KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonald's. OK, there's Starbucks. Hey, this is China....I did visit three magazine-recommended restaurants: Ganges(Indian), which is good and reasonably priced; Hatsune, a Japanese restaurant, which is expensive, and moderately good; and &quot;No name&quot; Chinese restaurant, which is in an interesting setting, expensive, and moderately good.J. MONEY. You rarely hear &quot;Yuan&quot; being said. You hear mostly &quot;Kuai&quot;, which means &quot;Yuan&quot;!K. Pronunciation. Foreigners will have difficulty with the &quot;X&quot; and the &quot;Q&quot; in the transliteration of Chinese names. Well, pronounce &quot;X&quot; like &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; like &quot;Ch&quot;. So &quot;Xin&quot; becomes &quot;Sin&quot; and &quot;Qing&quot; becomes &quot;Ching&quot;. Not perfect, but close enough for you to be understood. L. CROWNE PLAZA ZHONGGUANCUN---Yes.Have a pleasant stay in Beijing! Jun 1 2021 	Fantastic Hotel and Staff!	My wife and I stayed in this hotel from May 29th to June 1st, 2021. We were very impressed with everything in the hotel. It's brand-new and the staff were fantastic, extremely friendly and really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to see we were well cared for. We were able to get a great &quot;special&quot; rate on the hotel website. We only paid RMB 603/night and we had a great room. It was very large, the bathroom was huge, and the bed was fabulous.The hotel is located close to Qinghua University and the Qinghua Science Park, where we were doing some training over the weekend, so it is in a very convenient location if you need to be near the Science Park. The food in the main floor restaurant, where we ate one dinner and three buffet breakfasts, was okay, although we would not say it was fantastic. However, the service in the restaurant was super, especially a young female server named Ethel was super friendly. She remembered our names and called us by them each morning when she saw us in the restaurant. Actually, as I have already mentioned, all of the staff were just super. We can't say enough about this hotel, we would absolutely stay there again when in Beijing for business. Dec 31 2008 	fabulous hotel	hotel seemed quite new, taxi driver dont know the location,but all in all its a fantastic stay,all staff really nice,our room was large and comfortable and very clean,the food is really good ,I had business lunch and dimsum in chinese restaurant called rouge,its quite something different , very good value for money. Dec 31 2008 	very good valeu for money	I had a good and warm welcome upon my arrival , room comfortable enough space .  I had also a good relaxing time at the pool surprisinlgy warm water .Mixs italian tepan grill restaurant is a new concept as i was explained , the food prepared was really good &quot; all cooked in front of you&quot; with tremendous care for small details , the chocoalte cake and ice cream called gelato with mocha cafe was a fantastic end ( compliment by the chef )Breakfast in valley cafe was good , definetly is an hotel that i would reccomend to others .Hope soon to be back . Nov 6 2008 	Enjoyed the stay	I spent a week in the Crowne Plaza Zhongguancun. I found the rooms to be very comfortable, quiet, and overall a very positive experience. None of the taxis I took knew where it was, and I believe this is the first review of this property on TripAdvisor - I learned when I arrived that it had only been open for 1 month! They were still working on a few of the floors, and neither the pool or spa were open. The food was quite good - I only experienced the (abundant) breakfast buffet and roomservice, but I understand there are several restaurants. Service in general was a bit spotty, not just in the restaurant, but all around, as the staff seemed quite new, and English was a little weak for a number of the employees. That said, they sure tried hard!The neighborhood immediately around the hotel doesn't seem to have much to offer, so I was glad I had the comfort and fast internet connection in the hotel as a distraction!I would recommend staying here for anyone with business in this part of Beijing. However, if you business needs are across town, be forewarned that traffic can be atrocious!"
"Handy for the airport	I have stayed at this airport a couple of times, selecting it for its proximity to the airport. The first time I stayed was shortly after the Olympic Games. The hotel was practically empty and the service was attentive, friendly but occasionally haphazard. On my next visit I had just arrived from North Korea - which probably enhanced my appreciation of the hotel! The bar, on both my stays, was virtually empty but offered good international sports coverage on TV. The shuttle service to the airport worked well. Word of warning: taxi drivers have difficulty finding the hotel, even if you show them the address in Chinese. One evening I had to use my - very! - limited Chinese to help the driver find the hotel. Nov 10 2021 	Excellent for the airport not for the city...	Similar thoughts to others. Great for the airport but theres nothing around the hotel and it would be a decent taxi fare to anywhere in the city. Entrance of the hotel is very smart, lobby is very open with a glass ceiling. No one else was checking in or out so we had fast service unlike other comments I noted from people, my experience was good and the staff were friendly. Room. Excellent and large, as this was our last night in China I had booked a suite. It was large, very! seperate lounge with toilet. There was internet access but you had to pay, the first hotel all holiday that wasnt free, a bit dissapointing given this was a suite and something the hotel should look at in my opinion. The room also included access to the club lounge which was very nice. Free drinks and nibbles for 2 hours at night. A good selction of foods and various drinks available. Very quiet while we were there. Level of English from the staff was good, not as good as some places but enough to get by.We also ate in the cafe which did bar type meals, quality was good, price was a bit high but not too over the top. Breakfast was very good and the usually options of western and asian. We used the shuttle bus to the airport which you need to book with the concierge. It was free and prompt. Overall an excellent hotel but I would only recommend it for liesure if its your 1st or last night stay. I wouldnt want to be based here as theres nothing around the hotel to see and you are a long way from the centre, see my review of the Park Plaza for a better located hotel! The hotel is very smart though and was very quite while we were there, I expect if there is a conference nearby it will be packed so you might want to check before. Oct 24 2021 	nice but only if you have patient and time	This hotel is located directly at the new exhibition center (5 min walking).It's a newer hotel with many nice rooms and good breakfast.But this hotel is not normal crown standard. The service seams to be overstrained:1. We have made a reservation one week before. We also got a receipt by fax. But when we arrived at 10pm, after a long business day and travel, there was no room. It takes about 45min and long discussions to get a room. That's worse!2. For check out you need plenty of time. For us it takes about 40 minutes. The reason is, that this is a huge hotel, but they have more security staff than receptionist. There are only 3 receptionist at the desc and they are overextended. It takes about 20 minutes to get a bill.  I don't know why. They already have got a reservation with company name. They have my passport from check-in. But for checkout, they have to write everything in the computer (and very slowly).3. During breakfast it is better to get the coffee by your own, because there is less staff. Also you need some more table for the old dishes.The hotel is nice, but you need a lot of time for everything. I don't know why they have so view staff. They need more employees and better organisation/management.It's too expensive for so low standard. Oct 14 2021 	Strange Room But Otherwise Nice--And Good Location	We stayed here for one night en route to another destination. Its primary advantage is that it is close to the airport. The airport shuttle worked well for us. The hotel staff were friendly, and the overall quality of the hotel is good. If you are looking for a place to stay that will give you easy access to the major sites of Beijing, this is not the right place, but for access to the airport it is great. The only thing that really put us off (but it put us off quite a lot) was the strange bathroom. I don't know if all rooms are this way, but ours had a large window from the bathroom into the bedroom--basically, the whole wall was a window. This is not a plus in my book, though somebody obviously thought it was. There were blinds that you could close over the window, which was fine unless either the blinds did not close tightly, or a piece of one of the slats was missing. In our case, the blinds had both features, which meant that there was not very good privacy in the bathroom. Maybe I'm a privacy freak, but come on. Other than that, the room was fine, and the hotel served its purpose. I'd still probably recommend it--but hey, fix those blinds! Oct 13 2021 	Great Hotel	Great hotel the rooms were very good and the staff were very efficient and helpful. Location to the airport is good but there is not much near the hotel if you are staying for any length of time this could be an issue. Sep 19 2021 	Good Value for the money	We stayed at the hotel one night before taking off to Europe. The room was nice and clean. Breakfast and service was ok, nothing extra but very decent. There is nothing to see or in the surroundings.The hotel is good value for the money if you have to stay near the airport. we paid 400 RMD for a King Sized bedroom. Sep 18 2021 	Great location for an exhibition hotel; terrible location for sightseeing	Stayed here for 6 nights in September for an exhibition at the NCIEC. Location is close to the exhibition centre, but still not really walking distance, especially since our event used the north entrance. There are also not a great deal of amenities in the area, plus walking anywhere aroud there is risky (from a traffic perspective). It is clear that the area is still being developed, so maybe local amenities and pedestrian friendly access will improve over time. Many attendees did some sightseeing before, after, or during the exhibition. It's a long cab ride to central Beijing: anywhere from 40 minutes to well over an hour, depending on traffic. If being a tourist is your main reason for being in Beijing, stay elsewhere. If you're coming for the Exhibition Centre, or need a hotel relatively close to the airport, then this is a good one. (Attendees staying at other, more central hotels had to leave an hour earlier than we did in the morning just to get to the Exhibition Centre in time.)The staff were all extremely polite and usually quite effective. However, they were also fairly slow, at least by North American standards. Drinks in the lounge or restaurant definitely took their time in coming. English proficiency was a problem for some, but many others seemed to have a good grasp of the language. Food in the Crowne Cafe was pretty good, with quite a large variety of Asian and western foods, especially for the buffet breakfast. Had a standard room which met all my requirements, but wasn't anything over and above what I'd expect from a hotel like this (in room safe, nice bathroom, internet...) although it did still smell fairly new. My only real complaint about the room itself was the shower... Water leaked through the shower door and onto the floor. Others indicated the same thing occurred in their rooms as well. I thought the fitness centre was rather small, but in retrospect, in the times that I used it, I never did see people having to wait to use equipment. There is a sauna and steam room as well, but both were cold when I was there, and I didn't feel like waiting for them to warm up. The equipment is very good quality and appears well maintained. Bring your headphones and you can watch an individual TV on the cardio equipment. On the way back home, a colleague and I used the hotel's shuttle to the airport. No problems at all. It left when they said it would and took us right to Terminal 3 (after fighting some traffic). Sep 3 2021 	Very kind staffs	I chose this hotel because I had to transit at Beijing and the next flight was 7:30 a.m.I had an afternoon to spend in Beijing and the staffs were kind enough to give me a consult on sightseeing. All of the staffs were kind and friendly, and they spoke good English.The rate was reasonable, rooms were clean and very comfortable.Although there was nothing near the hotel, I think it's a really good place to stay if transit is your main purpose of the stay in Beijing. Aug 18 2021 	Top class hotel	The hotel was fantastic. Clean, quiet, staff very helpfull and courteous. Food was good. Plenty of bars and lounges to relax in. Rooms spacious and well equipped. Not much around the hotel if you need a corner shop. When you come out of the airport do not go to the hotel reservations desk for help finding the courtesy bus as they will tell you it is not running at that time and charge you alot for one of their cars. Check with hotel where to be picked up in advance. Aug 11 2021	Nice one-night stopover for tour group	I read some of the reviews and I am not surprised by the gentleman who had the poor massage experience. We had read that hotels, even 5-star ones similar to the Crowne Plaza, have people on staff willing to go the &quot;extra mile&quot; for customers who may not want it. Clearly they wanted to shame him into getting something he did not want. Fortunately, our experience was excellent, with excellent service and spacious comfortable rooms. This is truly a 5-star hotel, though it is located in an industrial area. You would NOT choose this hotel to stay in for any length of time, as you cannot really walk about outside and explore at night in a poor industrial area where people's shacks are alongside their repair garage businesses. We would only recommend this as a stopover hotel. Luckily we had a tour bus and there were no transportation or communication issues for us, but I can see where there would be for people who are not sheparded around with a Chinese guide as we were. If you want to stay in Beijing for any length of time, there is a &quot;five star row&quot; of hotels downtown. Jul 27 2021 	Disappointing business hotel.	Stayed here for business for a week. Location handy for the exhibition centre and airport nearby. We arrived after a 12-hour trip from Europe, hoping to catch the bus shuttle from the airport. Unfortunately it has left, and we didn't feel like waitíng (it is an hourly service)-we decided to take a cab instead- What an odyssey that was- even though I explained to the taxi driver where the hotel was - I speak Chinese- and I was extra polite - He [--] us about and pretended not to know where the hotel was and drove us around for 40 mins. Seemed he was not happy about having waited 3 hours for a pick-up at the hotel only to get a couple of passengers who only need a 15-min ride. Well - his chances of a tip evaporated.My boss was arriving the following day and I didn't want him to go though the same ordeal- so we asked the hotel staff to arrange this- I had to explain carefully in Chinese what to do - their English was not up to it.Having said that the room service and standard of food was pretty good. Jul 22 2021 	nice place and convenient to the airport just don't walk back from the mall	the service was exceptional, the rooms just fine, swimming pool nice altho they made you wear a shower cap we visited the euromall - great restaurants - recommend the blue frog! but don't walk back - you need a taxi there is no footpath. We booked the airport shuttle the next day and it was all very convenient. Really recommended for its proximity to the airport but not if you are staying in Beijing Jul 14 2021 	Service needs improvement	We stayed here for two nights (weekend) at the end of a business trip through China. This is a very nice hotel with comfortable rooms and it is located close to Beijing Capital Airport. However, the problem with this hotel is that the service provided by the personnel is below standard. Here are some examples: 1. Using the airport shuttle was a disaster. We had booked the shuttle at 9:30pm to bring us from the airport to the hotel. As no shuttle arrived, we called the hotel at 9:35 pm and although they mentioned that the van was on its way, it did arrive at 9:55 pm (and it is only ~ 15 minutes drive). The other day we had similar problems and hence my conclusion is that the hotel staff is not able to organize the shuttle airport pick-up properly. 2. The level of english spoken by the hotel staff is very poor. When calling the hotel about the shuttle, I could not communicate even the simplest issues (such as where is the pickup point of the shuttle?) with the front desk people or the concierge.  3. When checking out, we were charged 3 times the daily maximum internet usage (3 x RMB 120). I mentioned immediately that we had been in the hotel less than 48 hours. It took at least 10 minutes to convince the front desk people to finally admit the error, to correct it and to apologize. In summary, this is a beautiful and comfortable hotel but I would not recommend it to anyone. I cannot remember being so annoyed in a hotel about the behavior of the hotel staff over the last few years (and I travel a lot!). Hence, staying in this hotel and particularly using the hotel shuttle was a very unpleasant experience and induced a lot of unnecessary stress. May 16 2021 	Great Find	Incredible Hotel! Beautiful lobby and great rooms. The only downside is the distance from downtown - 90-100 yuan taxi ride. But, as a stopover during travel, it is very near the airport. This is a newer hotel and the staff was friendly and helped with every need. They do charge for internet access. The restaurants were very good and the staff was very attentive (even at the breakfast buffet). They offer a free shuttle to and from the airport and have a very good fitness center and spa. The hotel was very safe and quiet. An excellent place to relax before or after the flight to the US. Apr 30 2021 	Nice hotel but strange experience with the spa	I was transiting from Mongolia to Frankfurt and stayed just 1 day. It is true that the hotel is in quite an industrial location, but for a transit stay it's a good location, not far from the Airport. The staff was friendly, the airport shuttle worked well and delivered me to the Airport as scheduled. Rooms are also fine. The only problem in them is lightening. I did not manage to understand how to switch on or off various lamps. They were switching on or off all together, but not separately.However, I had a very strange (I would say, displeasing) experience with the spa. In the room I saw the advertisement that there are offers of foot massage, Chinese massage and oit massage for 180, 280 and 380 RMB respectively. I phoned the spa and asked foot massage and Chinese massage. The spa manager persuaded me to take foot massage and Chinese oil massage. The lady came into my room at 19.30 and has shown me from the menue another type of massage for RMB 520. I asked her in English to stick to the original plan, but later I discovered that she nevertheless followed the one for 520. But that's ok, can be attributed to linguistic miscommunication. Overall, she was just 21, but a good specialist in her field, Her massage looked very professional to me. However, at the end she disagreed to charge the room and insisted on cash. I had Euro only, so instead of 575 RMB (520 + service) I gave EUR 75. And that's when strange things began. She called her manager and the manager sent to my room a prostitute-looking lady who was allowed into my room by the 1st masseuse, not by me. She inspected the Euro notes, and started offering sex services - 'another kind of massage'. Imagine - after the massage I was on my bed dressed in underwear only and all this started happening in front of me!!! She was dressed in a blue uniform and even had a list of prices and service descriptions... I said 'no'. She asked 'why'. I said 'I don't have money, in order to kick her out'. She said 'You can charge credit card'. I said no. She started demonstrating her brest etc etc etc. Then when it was clear that I don't want her services, she again called spa manager and again without my permission allowed into my room one more prostitute looking lady. I shouted at them 'leave or I will call secuirity' and they left. But I had to raise from the bed and to dress in front of them, looking at me, before I did that. I admit that the hotel management may not be aware of how outrageous the spa workers became. Now I calmed down, but on that day I was extremely outraged, trust me. Throughout 10 hours journey to Franfkurt I was thinking only about that... It's unimaginable - in a 4 star facility such a thing happened. Mar 28 2021 	Nice Looking Hotel - Terrible Service	We specifically booked this hotel because of its close proximity to the Beijing Capital Airport. All of the websites also stated that the hotel offers an airport shuttle. The airport shuttle is, however, woefully unreliable. We made a reservation 6 hours prior to pick up (they required 1 hour notice). We waited 60 minutes before a representative from the hotel met us. After being told that the shuttle was on its way but delayed due to to traffic, we waited an additional 30 minutes before finally giving up and paying for a taxi. Mind you, on the way to the hotel we did not see any traffic. When we arrived at the hotel 15 minutes later the shuttle was still in front of the hotel. When we inquired about the situation, the conceirge informed us that it was our responsiblity to find the shuttle at the airport - not the other way around! We spoke to another guest (who is a frequent business traveler) about the shuttle and he told us that he just simply takes a cab because of the hotel's inability and incapacity to coordinate the logistics of the shuttle. In fact, on the morning of our departure flight, the bell boy loaded up our luggage into the shuttle. The shuttle thereafter left for the airport WITHOUT US. Unacceptable. Eventually, the hotel had a private van take us to the airport where we met up with our luggage. What a mess. The service at the hotel was terrible and we will never stay here again. We wanted to stay close to the airport for our last night in China to minimize stress the night before we returned to the U.S., and our stay here instead heightened our stress level. Stay away. Feb 9 2021 	Very nice but in the middle of nowhere	I needed a place to stay overnight while in transit from a city in China's interior (from which I had flown that afternoon), on my way back to the U.S. (to which I would fly the next morning). I chose this hotel for its location very close to the Beijing Airport . . . less than 10 minutes' away. I paid 612 RMB including breakfast.Taxi fare from the Beijing Airport to the hotel was only 22 RMB. I always dread getting into a taxi at an airport for a short-distance ride (i.e., a very low fare for a driver who may have been in a queue for hours hoping for a high fare to the center of the city), but this driver did not seem to care . . . maybe they have a provision where they can cut to the front of the line when they go back to the airport if they had a short ride. The taxi driver got a little lost on the way over, but fortunately I had the hotel's phone number with me so showed it to him so he could phone and as it turned out we were only 2 minutes away from the point of the phone call.The hotel is very nice and modern; very clean, comfortable room with high quality bedding and luxurious bathroom. I was there during the Chinese New Year holiday (in Jan 2021) and as such the hotel was eerily empty. I suspect this is primarily a business hotel and no business is done during the CNY holiday; few people travel on leisure to cold Beijing in January, and if they did, few vacationers would opt to stay in the middle of an industrialized area way out by the airport.The staff was very friendly . . . the fitness center was quite nice - large with a big glass exterior window, with free weights, about 8 weight machines, about 3-4 tread mills, a couple of ellptical machines and a couple of stair climbers. Exercise machines had individual TVs and built-in fans. The fitness center also had a large pool (though I did not use it).I'm not a spa kind of guy, but they did have a special of 60-minute foot massage for only 99 RMB, so I tried it and it was very nice.Only two downsides to this hotel, neither of which is a big deal:1. Its remote location in the midst of an industrial park type of area; there are no shops or restaurants nearby or much of anything to see or look at should you want to have an interesting leisurely stroll. So, if you are averse to mini-bars as a source for a can of diet Coke or a candy bar, be forewarned you can't just walk down the street to a convenience store.2. The English of the staff is not great; the message light on my phone was blinking . . . the instruction was to push the button to retrieve messages . . . so I pushed the button which rang the switchboard and they could not figure out what I was wanting . . . eventually they picked up my saying the word &quot;message&quot; and they interpreted it as &quot;massage&quot; so they transferred me to the spa &amp; salon. So I went downstairs to speak to the front desk and they thought I was trying to tell them that my phone was broken. Uggh!!! I later discerned that my wife had called. But I had to put up with a blinking message lights on all 3 room phones for the rest of my stay (Overnight, I covered up the lights with paper).The hotel does offer a free shuttle bus on the hour to the airport, so I used this. I was the only one on the bus.TV had usual assortment of English channels that you find in Asia . . . e.g., CNN, CNBC Asia, HBO. Jan 30 2021 	Not there yet	This Hotel is very convenient to the Airport and the Internation exhibition center. This was actually my second stay - the first was prior to the official opening.The hotel does have all the amenities that you would expect for a new property but as others have mentioned it is an extremely new staff and they just haven't had the training that you would expect in a Crowne Plaza. If you have business in the Shun Yi area by all means stay there the rooms are clean and the food is not bad. If you are looking to see the sights of Beijing - spring for a Hotel downtown so you can walk around Jan 30 2021 	Very poor service for high price and poor location	This hotel has all the mod cons and the rooms cannot be faulted but it isn't very close to the airport and the taxi drivers have no idea where it is and the hotel service element is not there.The management must be Chinese because they don't understand Western values and its inacceptable. If i am being charged Western prices then i expect Western service.I was overcharged 20 yuan for something so i pointed this out to the member of staff. She couldn't do anything about this because she had no authority...remember i have spent nearly 1000 yuan to stay here so what is 20 yuan (less than $3) so she had to call the hotel manager and the hotel manager refused to remove the $3 charge! Regardless if i am wrong or right, if a customer spending $150 is unhappy with a $3 charge then you immediately remove it. I could have just paid it but it was the principle of it. Avoid this place unless you don't mind getting fleeced. Oct 6 2008 	Great new airport hotel	The Crowne Plaza Beijing Intl Airport Hotel openned in July of 2008. The up side is that the hotel is brand new and really gorgeous. The down side is that some staff members are struggling with english. That said, the staff is very gracious and welcoming, even providing me with tea while I checked in. There are several restaurants and a lobby bar, gym, business center, broad band in rooms (120cny/day), etc - all the usual amenities for a hotel of this class. The room was quite comfortable, with high quality linens, tv with multiple english channels including CNN and HBO, bath with both marble shower and tub, bottled water of course because even here the water is not potable. There is a free shuttle to the airport on the hour. The ride takes 20 minutes. It is only 25 cny for a taxi. This is a good choice if you have an early flight or are worried about traffic delays from central Beijing. Sep 21 2021 	Sehr gutes Business-Hotel in Randlage"
"Nov 17 2021 	Dated and feels worn	I've stayed at this place over the years and liked in the past, This is the first visit in about 4 years and this time, the property feels dated. It needs a good renovation. It's functional but less than what you'd expect from a Crowne Plaza. There is a small mall nearby and you can get some restaurants at the next block, but unless you take a taxi or have someone drive you, it's not really a good location (unless you are visiting the Olympic Green, which is within easy walking distance)The breakfast buffet is OK and the day that I ate there, it was packed and the service was poor. It took 3 or 4 reminders and more than 10 minutes for them to bring new bowls out. They took the plates away quick enough but refill of coffee was slow. It still bothers me that people can smoke in the lobby. Some of the other hotels seem to not have that problem. Nov 16 2021 	Cold and comfortable what you'd expect from a 4/5 star business hotel	I stayed here towards the end of September for 4 nights. It's everything I'd expected from this class of a hotel. Comfortable, but impersonal hotel. The rooms are quite spacious and very comfortable. I had a corporate rate which included internet use, so I didn't feel the pinch of the pay-per-use internet users which I read in other reviews.The lobby is very large but had the stench of cigarettes since smoking is allowed there. Quite a number of very nice looking restaurants in the lobby but I didn't try any of them. My room was facing the courtyard (and 4th Ring road, I think), so it was a little bit noisy as they were having their Oktoberfest promotion in the tents on the ground floor. The loud music was bothering me slightly, but that's also because I'm a light sleeper and like things absolutely silent.Next door to the hotel is a small mall with a supermarket, some specialty shops as well as a food court. The food court was pretty good with very affordable prices and a variety of local food. I enjoyed eating there a number of times. It was good that I didn't have to eat in the hotel restaurants all the time, with the food court right next door available for light and simple meals.Across the road, about 10-15 minutes walk is also the Olympic park where the Birds Nest stadium and Watercube swimming arena is. It was quite a treat to be able to just walk there and see these amazing architectural marvels.The area is generally quite safe and I spent one night walking around. Some spots were quite dark but I didn't feel threatened at any time. Taxis are also readily available at the hotel.Overall, it was one of those forgettable stays when traveling for business, which is not necessarily a bad thing because the memorable ones (for business travel) are usually the ones where something bad happened! Would I stay here again? Yes, because there are no surprises and everything is as expected. Nov 4 2021 	average!	Hotel room very spaceious and nice decor, clean and well maintained. there were few things I would like to point out. firstly, for some reason, every night from 7pm there was a terrible smell comes from the drain and we tried to close the bathroom door and light a candle but it doesn't help. Secondly, there never a spoon on the table to use, and every day we have to asked the waitress or waiter for spoon and it took more than 5 minutes for a spoon to arrived, some re-organising at the breakfast tables needed. It was stated that the hotel has its indoor heated swimming pool, but it was always freezing cold water, never heated. Steam room only steam for few minutes and have to wait for over 10 minutes for steam to come on, Sauna also freezing cold. They really need to have a better system for avoiding hair going into the drains at the shower at fitness centre, as it was a pool of dirty water at your feets while having a shower, not good at all. Aug 27 2021	Beijing Crown Plaza OK stay expensive Internet	Our large group of 30 people for this company paid trip went to Beijing for 5 days, this is the hotel our travel agency put us in. The hotel itself is clean, and very nicely done. I don't know the price we got, since we got this as a packaged deal. The place is a bit far from the main city center, 30 minutes or so none traffic, but it is about 5-10 minutes walk from the 2021 Olympic Park. The place is very quiet as well, since most places around closes after 10pm. There are some small stores and restaurants around but closes after 10pm as well. Overall, I am satisified with the stay. However, if you do need internet, this trip will be expensive for you. There is NO free internet in the rooms, so you will have to pay for depending on the time you needed. There is also a business center in the 2nd floor with both English or Chinese computers that you can use as well. They can also rent out laptop/copier/fax etc if you need to. From my understanding, they do speak some English if you speak slow. Oh, the pool area also closes around 10pm, but at 9:30pm, they will not let you in anymore to use it. While we were there, very very few people used the pool, but it was very clean and quiet. The hotel gym is also very nice and clean if you decided to use it. They do have some yoga/pilate supplies if you want to use as well. Their breakfast was ok, not the best, especially when they have lots of people then they are not able bring out much variety of food. Also, we asked them to fill our water bottle, it took them about 5 minutes just to do so, so you may want to buy your water elsewhere instead. They do give 1 free bottle of water per person each day left in your room. Finally, their water is very hard water, so it made washing my hair not so pleasant experience. The last time I stayed in a Shanghai hotel I did not have this problem. Jul 20 2021 	Good hotel out of the way though	I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the nearby conference center. I was there for nearly a full week.Good things - * Room was in good shape, all fixtures worked properly* Comfortable bed with 4 pillows to choose from* Good working desk set-up* Helpful service in the lobby. * Good breakfast buffet* Nearby restaurants, grocery store* Good Peking Duck place within walking distance, ask the concierge* Refrigerator in room* Room service quick and good qualityThings that could have been better -* Internet access was a bit on the pricey side* Rate they listed was not the same as my confirmation, had to show them my printed confirmation to get this fixed* Location a bit out of the way for major tourist sites (with the exception of the Olympic village sights)If I were doing a general tourist itinerary, I would stay in a more central location. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the hotel was, and had a good stay. Jun 18 2021 	a good weekend spend at this hotel !	I spent the whole weekend in this hotel with my husband and two teenage children. I have attend conference before here. This time, I find the hotel is not only good for business but also a good choose for family. We enjoyed the spacious rooms, breakfast, swimming pool. the envirement of the Yellowstone restaurant is fatastic, the BBQ dinner it offered is very ungofetble. And all the staff are very friendly! the hotel very near the Bird's Nest and Cubes, we just walk to there. Mar 12 2021 	Overall good	I stayed here 10 days for business. Compared to other Crowne Plazas the service was maybe not just up to scratch. My main complaint is that Internet access is expensive in the rooms (£12 for every 24 hours) and WLAN in the cafes/bars of the hotel is not so comfortable, and the cost of drinks you are expected to buy is high. You can sit in the lobby and access WLAN but there are not many seats. On the positive side, Internet access is made so easy.Note that 15% service charge is added on to every part of the hotel bill.During my stay the gym/pool was uder renovation, so as from March 2021 this facility should be up and running again, and pretty good. A new small shopping mall is open under the North Times Tower - only 50 metres from the main door. Here you can visit Zoe's bar who provide very nice coffee and cakes at fair prices with free WLAN access.The concierge were helpful but overall the problem is a language one.The location of the hotel is perfect from the point of view of the Birds Nest stadium and the Water Cube which you can visit about 50 RMBs each.Shopping needs a nerve with haggling and the Clothing Market can be recommended, but remember all products are probably 'seconds'. Use the subway (1.5km from hotel) and get anywhere for 2 RMBs a stretch. (Airport express is 25RMBs.)Trips are organised by the hotel. 470 RMBs to visit the Great Wall, which is a must, even if probably overpriced. Oct 16 2008 	Nice but with problems...	We spent 6 nights at this hotel, and were not too impressed with it. First of all, we were given two twin beds, and the staff was unable to find a king/queen bed room for us, even though we stayed for a 6 nights, which is a pretty long stay. They had rooms available with a queen bed, but at a higher rate, and were unwilling to give us (since we were unwilling to pay extra!). Second, unless you're into the Olympic village, which is right next to the hotel, the location is not convenient, the hotel is pretty far out, there's not much around it, and you need to take a taxi or the subway (which is 15 minutes away) to go to the attractions. Third, I needed to get train tickets to go to Shanghai, and most hotels can buy tickets for you for a small fee, well, this upscale, expensive hotel, has a travel center that would arrange only airplane tickets (at a crazy price) with a staffer who didn't speak English, no train tickets. So they ended up sending me to the post office to get my train tickets which was complicated given that I don't speak Chinese. Considering that the post office is close to the hotel, and that they have plenty of staff, and that all hotels provide train tickets, it's appalling that this pretentious hotel wouldn't help guests with such a common request, simply ridiculous! Fourth, the rate was way too high for what we got: 1,800RMB/night with only one breakfast. Given the location, and service provided. Fifth, there were some problems with the rate they initially quoted us, and with a breakfast we were overcharged for, and when we were checking out it took one hour to solve these simple issues. The nice things about this hotel are the clean, comfortable rooms, some staff speaks pretty good English, and most of all a very nice (albeit expensive, 170rmb per person!) breakfast. But overall, I wouldn't recommend it for tourists, too far out, too expensive for what you get, no help for train tickets. Sep 20 2008 	Great Hotel till........	I have been a regular for Crowne Plaza Wuzhou for the last 2 years. It has offered great service and facility for bussiness. Till I encounter the incident below.My recent stay from Sep 5th to Sep 10th has been tainted by a staff at the breakfast cafe. The staff that was preparing the omellete/chinese pancake was rather rude to be in a five star hotel like Crowne Plaza. I ordered my chinese pancake for 30 minutes it was not served, and during the interval 3 reminders was given to him. The staff did not even offered an appology. Hope the hotel management can look into the black horse that tainted a great hotel Jul 16 2008 	An excellent Hotel	Stayed here for a congress at the nearby conference centre. The hotel was excellent and the staff friendly, helpful and competent. Rooms were spotless with room service 3 times a day. Breakfast was a huge buffet with cooks on hand to make scrambled eggs or whatever you wished . Breakfast consisted of Chinese, English and European food with lots of fruit etc. The coffee could have been better but otherwise excellent. I would definately stay here again. Jun 30 2008 	Nice hotel great gym.	I stayed at this hotel for a recent meeting, which was held in the hotel itself. It's an excellent facility, and I highly recommend it. The rooms are nice, as you'd expect at this price point. The breakfast buffet is ample, and covers about five different cuisines! The hotel gym/pool is great. As a swimmer, I was impressed that the pool was long enough (probably about 50 feet) to do laps, and square enough to do flip turns on both ends.The hotel is on the 4th ring road, very close to the olympic venues. If you want to get into Beijing center (eg forbidden city) it's about a 30 yuan cab ride that took us 20-45 minutes depending on traffic.If you do not speak Mandarin, I'd recommend that you get the chinese characters for the hotel name/address printed out on paper before you arrive at the airport. Not all the taxi drivers at the airport could read the English name/address that I had printed out from the hotel website.All in all though, this is a great choice, particularly if you need to be north of Beijing during your trip. May 9 2008 	Two Weeks...was pretty nice	I had a business trip to the Technology Park (Motorola, Nortel, Ericsson) and had a two week stay at the Crown. Overall, I would have to say the experience was excellent. The staff was excellent. The breakfast buffet was amazing and the location was decent for a stay to Beijing. Tourism wise, most of your destinations that are outside of Beijing are towards the North. Its a bit of a walk to the subway (prob a mile) but there are plenty of Taxis available too. They have a shuttle for folks heading out to the tech park though too. Thats a nice touch! Kudos for that.Its next to the Olympic park so thats pretty neat. Laundry is REALLY expensive so pack accordingly. There are plenty of places to eat close to the hotel too.Drinks are expensive....but here is a little hint. Right next to the elevators is a &quot;staff only&quot; entrance. There is a Coke machine thats super cheap right by the door. Shhh.Overall, it was an excellent experience. Then again, Im easy to please and it was on the company dime. Mar 22 2008 	TIred	Stayed for 2 nights at the club level of Crowne Plaza Wuzhou. The hotel is adjacent to the BICC, which was the main purpose of our visit to Beijing. Hotel looked impressive from the outside. Staff generally courteous, helpful and many can speak English. Lobby alright except for the smell of cigarette smoke. Only 3 lifts available during our visit as the other 3 were undergoing renovation. Club lounge does not serve food or snacks, only has limited variety of drinks available. Room was spacious. However thermostat was not working well. Even though it was cold outside (7C), the room was stuffy without much ventilation so we ended up having to open the windows to let the cool breeze in. Room safe available, bath amenities provided, apples available in the room and in hallway. Generally not raving about the hotel. Would be better to stay in another hotel for the price we paid. Major construction undergoing on adjacent lot, so expect noise at night, which we heard despite staying on the 15th floor (hotel max 17 levels). Mar 2 2008	Great Location	The Crowne Plaza is right opposite the Olympic Stadium in Wuzhou. The hotel is very clean, modern and comfortable. The staff are as helpful as possible but there are quite often language barrier problems. The hotel has several restuarants all reasonably priced and very nice. Hotel staff assisted with bookings to visit Great Wall, Tianamen Square, Forbidden City etc either via taxi or with tour guide. There are several good restuarants, supermarket and shopping area about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The pool and gym area also very good. Jan 12 2008 	Excellent hotel for Olympic guests a bit far from center of city	The Crowne Plaza Wuzhou is a bit further away from central Beijing, but it is situated right next to most of the Olympic sports venues and is not far from the fashionable Chaoyang district. The hotel has an impressive look and feel to it, and the lobby and lobby bar are superb. Staff is friendly and speaks very good english. The hotel is spotlessly clean, and looks very new. The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated, giving the feel of luxury. The view from my room at least was very nice indeed. Dec 30 2007	Recommended	This is a very nice hotel indeed. Very high standard, nice rooms, and a surprisingly large heated swimming pool.Just a five minute walk from the hotel there is a small shopping area, with a few restaurants.Definitely recommended for Beijing.Dew. Oct 26 2007 	Pleasantly surprised	I went to Beijing for a conference and this hotel was right next to the BICC. It's in the Olympic village area, but not suitable for people doing business downtown. I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the hotel - spotless, young, polite staff with a lot of initiative, excellent restaurant etc. My 'Deluxe' room was huge with the bathroom bigger than a hotel room in Tokyo. Everything worked and I was impressed by how clean it was. Being a Chinese national, I must say I am proud of the amazing progress of my country and its people. Bravo, Beijing, I hope you won't let us down in 2008! Oct 15 2007 	Great hotel for Olympics	The Crown Plaza Wuzhou is an excellent 5star hotel. Clean, spacious well appointed rooms with helpful English speaking staff. The breakfast buffet had everything you could wish for, both western and chinese, including freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices made to order, which made a great start to the morning. The Brazilian restaurant was excellent and made a welcome change to chinese food.We stayed here while attending a conference as it is adjacent to the Conference Centre, but it is about a 45minute taxi ride to the center of Beijing. However it is across the road from the Olympic stadium and with the opening of the new metro lines next year it will be a perfect place to stay. Jul 31 2007 	Perfect hotel for short trip	This hotel was really a star in comparing to other nearing hotels. It is 5-star hotel and have really good service and rooms. Rooms are quite not fully luxurious, but above the average. Rooms were always clean, good smells, beds comfortable, and everything worked. The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate for three (two adults and one child). Breakfast was really excellent - with foods from almost every continents. The hotel's location is its main drawback, being some 30 til 45 minutes of driving with taxi from the center, where are all touristic locations are. This will change next year (in 2008) after they will finish subway (metro), which will be located right on the corner of the hotel. In that case this hotel will be best bed for families. Only weather and air pollution is in July in Beijing really bad. Tourist should go to Beijing only in October or at the beginning of November and avoid comming in summer months.I will always recommend the hotel to all. Mar 27 2007 	Enjoyed our stay	We stayed at this hotel in January 2007. My husband was in Beijing on business travel and stayed here for three weeks. We found the hotel to be very nice, clean, and the service to be excellent during our stay. Please be aware that this hotel is not located in downtown Beijing where all the tourist sites are, so be prepared to take a taxi if you stay here. You won't be able to walk to the sites from the hotel. However, taxis are constantly dropping off people at the hotel, so getting a taxi to take you downtown is not a problem and the price is not expensive. One thing I'd like to mention is that this hotel is within walking distance of the Olympic Stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics and appears to be very close to where all the olympic activities in Beijing will be held. If you are planning to visit for the Olympics, I believe this hotel will be in very close proximity to the events. We definitely enjoyed our stay here. It seemed to be a favorite amongst business travelers. The hotel restaurants and room service were very good. The breakfast buffet catered to everyone with international cuisines from american, european, and asian. The pool and gym facilities were very nice too. We would definitely stay here again if we had to return to Beijing. Jan 24 2007	Excellent Dining Experience	Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The rooms very frankly tired and in need of refurbishment, however very clean. Beds were firm and very comfortable. Options are for a king bed or 2 large king singles and as we were there with our 6 year old child a roll in bed was offered and worked well. I would consider the rooms overheated but we were able to get the window opened for fresh air. Without doubt dining at &quot;cafe Asia&quot; was outstanding and run by an Australian Executive chef catering to all tastes. The cost was very reasonable (148 rmb for dinner buffet) per person and the child free. We ate all our meals in Cafe Asia as it was so diverse, exciting and fresh that you could not do better outside. I would definately stay here again as what the rooms lacked in glamour was more than compensated by the dining experience. Aug 24 2006	A real five star Hotel	I stayed there for about one week at the end of June for the attendance of a conference. This is probably the best five star hotel I have ever been.Staff were most polite and helpful (as one would expect from Chinese culture?). Just an example, I asked for a plug adaptor from Chinese to European. They came immediatly bringing a variety (!!!) of equipment for every posible scenario. Room service was also very fast and good. The room was very large and clean, and contained everything one can possibly need. Breakfast also included everything a reasonable person can ask for. There are three restaurants in the hotel (at least, I found three). I used only the one next to the Palm lobby(?). They have an excellent buffet for dinner which includes great variety and very good quality in both wester and easter cuisine. Staff in the restaurant are also very polite and efficient (some times their English is not very good, but we have to be understanding). The two other restaurants have cantonese (that is of southern China) and meat dishes, but I did not try them as the buffet completely covered me and my friends. The area in which the hotel is located is rather rich and upcoming and there are shops and a large supermarket less than 10' walk from the hotel. The olympic stadium that will host the 2008 Olympic games is very near the hotel. The hotel is between 20 and 40 minutes (depending on the time of the day) from Tiananmen square. Given how cheap taxis are in China, it is in a very good location. Jul 13 2006	Problems with the staff	Stayed at this hotel using rewards nights with hotels priority club points and hotel voucher from travel agent. Staff on VIP floor had difficulties comprehending simple questions in english. Had to deal with assistant managers in order to get reservations clarified. Stayed there for eleven nights and staff did not resolve hotel voucher reservation problem until the day of check out. Had to spend several hours of my time requesting the staff to clarify the problem. Same problem and attitude dealing with staff at front desk in the Lobby level. Had difficulty exchanging traveller's cheques or Canadian/american currency at the front desk. Ended up having to walk to nearby bank to exchange travellers cheques. Better to just take out amount needed from ATM machine in the lobby.The hotel was very comfortable otherwise. The rest of the staff in the restaurant, fitness room, pool, housekeeping, concierge provided excellent service. Hotel and rooms very clean. Carpets in the rooms and hallways could use a washing. Approximately 30 minutes outside of downtown core. Cost 35 to 40 RMB to travel by taxi to most places. Book the &quot;Club&quot; rooms. Rate includes breakfast upstairs in the Club Lounge or downstairs restaurant. Club rate also includes cocktails in the afternoon and use of internet services. May 26 2006	Perfect if you have business around there	(Sorry about my english) Due to bookingerror at the CP Qingdao I spent 1 night an the CP Park view. I can say that you are treated like a VIP in this hotel. Big (club) room, perfect breakfast, very nice personel. My internet problems were solved within a moment. Location is very outside the center of Beijing therefore i changed to the CP in the center with no problems. Club manager was perfect!!! I can recommend it for business! Mar 31 2006 	great hotel for business travellers and couples	I travel to Beijing often and have stayed at several hotels over the years, but this one is great! Attentive service, clean, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and a good set of restaurants. lots of really good restaurants close by as well for more local flavor (especially hot pots and peking duck). Concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful. terrific beds and pillows and great bath robes. good value for my money Dec 20 2005 	great brazilian restaurant!	In November I had to spend a couple of weeks on a business trip in Asia. I also went to Beijing. My company booked me into the Crowne Plaza Park View. Altogether I had a really good stay-experience. The hotel is pretty new and the facilities are what you would expect from a five star hotel. A couple of asian restaurant, big pool, etc. What I liked best about the hotel was its brazilian restaurant though. I was longing for some meat after all this asian food and that is what I got. The waiter comes to your table and slices down as much meat, sausage, etc. as you want. I thought it was a pretty cheap all you can eat deal as well. Recommended if you are into meat! Aug 16 2021	???????????? Apr 24 2008	Precio para las Olimpiadas"
"Excellent - would stay here again	Aside from location, this hotel is superb. I was very impressed with the receptionist, Mr Tim Tian, at check-in. We checked in at an unconventional time in the morning and most hotels would not be able to accommodate us at that hour. Mr Tian must have seen how tired we were and let us check in earlier then usual. The room is spacious/clean and bed was very comfortable. The dessert I had from room service was lacking - guess I shouldn't have such high expectations. Buffet breakfast was great - excellent selection and strong coffee.Would be better value for money if internet was wireless and free. They currently charge RMB 120 for 24 hours. The hotel is very much out of the way, but Parkson is opening next door and I'm sure the area will be much more happening soon.Would have given a 5-star rating for service, but their concierge needs improvement. The storage is so far away, it takes them forever to retrieve stored luggage. I guess for the same reason, bus boys are often walking to or in the storage area and is absent from the concierge counter. Sep 6 2021 	Almost Perfect	The hotel is relatively new, room is spacious, staff very obliging. Buffet was great with a lot of choices. The only thing did not earn this hotel full marks is its location, almost in the middle of building sites, near the major ring road. quite isolated for us who like to wonder around the hotel to soak in the local admosphere and use the public transport. The underground is quite hidden near the hotel. It took a bit of searching to find the entry. However, if you like taxi here and there, then the location is going to be fine. Aug 30 2021	One of the best hotels I have stayed in.	This is definitely a great hotel. It is very luxurious, and the staff are there to cater for any whim at the drop of a hat. The rooms are large, the beds very comfortable, and the bathroom was really good too with plenty of room, complimentary bathrobes and slippers etc.The reason this hotel was so good in my view was the food. Fabulous buffet breakfast with everything and anything you could possible want. The restaurant in the evenings was also buffet, but very cleverly had 7 or 8 sections with food from different parts of the world, Italian, Indian, etc. so every palate was catered for, if for example you are not a lover of Chinese food. Overall, the hotel is excellent. The location was OK, but as we were on a guided trip the location was not an issue, as we were picked up and dropped off every day. Jul 15 2021 	Amazing!	Amazing hotel, was very impressed by the rooms. The bed was very comfortable and was just as comfortable as my own bed back home. Had a wonderful night's rest here. The buffet breakfast is out of this world too, good selection of both western and chinese cuisines.Front reception staff and concierge and bell boys spoke english.Would definately stay again, but the hotel location is a little bit out of the way and not too much to see and do within walking distance of the hotel.However, this hotel is excellent and would recommend it!! May 14 2021 	New elegant place	Very nice hotel. Its new and fresh. Rooms are pretty big and have a trendy design. I really liked the bathrooms which had separate shower and tub. All in natural stone and glass. And a cool window above the tub. The breakfast was really great during the weekdays, however not so well maintaned on the weekend. Seems like they stopped refilling cheese, juices, fruits even if it was still more than one hour before closing the breakfast. This is not a downtown hotel but location is Ok, not so bad as some reviewers have written, even though there is contruction going on everywhere around the hotel. But this is typical for Beijing. There are some restaurants within 10 minutes walking distance (one of these is a really good local restaurant serving the typical Peking Duck). The hotel concierge service is GREAT. Very helpful with everything. The front desk staff was also very service minded and flexible. The hotel has a nice spa with swimming pool and saunas. Finally, as other reviewers have stated - most taxi drivers have a hard time finding the hotel. Make sure you have a note with hotel phone number, name and address in chinese letters to show the driver. May 11 2021 	Great stay	My family and I spent 8 days total at the Crowne Plaza Sun Palace Hotel in May, 2021 over two different periods. Our basic premise for choosing the hotel was 1)it allowed for more than 1 kid in the room; 2)it seemed like a new, clean and 4-5* hotel; and 3)great price/value for the hotel.We were not disappointed one bit - in fact we came to think of our hotel as our &quot;temporary home&quot; and were really able to relax and refresh from our long days out sightseeing.The best thing about the hotel was definitely the service. From top to bottom everybody was extremely nice and helpful and friendly. Our two kids (aged 3 and 1) were immediately given lots of attention. The staff from the front desk to the concierge to the bell staff to the hotel management called us by name the entire trip. The concierge really tried hard to help us out by getting train tickets ahead of our stay, which another hotel in another city refused to do for us.The rooms were brand new and comfortable. Nicely appointed and tastefully done. The hotel itself is still a bit of a work-in-process. There is an adjoining complex that houses ballrooms, event facilities, restaurants and a spa. Two of the restaurants (both Chinese) are open, while the Italian restaurant is yet to be opened.The knock we read about on the hotel is that it was out of the way. And yes it is and no it isn't. It's not close to the center of Beijing, and by the center I mean Forbidden City. The hotel is on the third ring, and you can tell that in another five years the landscape will look a lot different from where it is today. Lots of construction going on. Nevertheless, we trucked the family to the neighboring subway station (2-3 minute walk) and were in town rather quickly (i.e. one transfer). We were surprised by a few really good restaurants in the area that were within walking distance. It's not the kind of hotel where you're going to leave in the morning, come back for lunch and then leave again in the afternoon. Pretty much when we left, we were gone from morning until evening and we came back for the night.There is a pool, which was great for the kids. While the kiddie pool and hot tub looked to be undergoing some renovation we were able to sneak a corner of the lap pool for ourselves to swim with the young kids.We tried two of the restaurants and they were fairly expensive and on par with most western restaurants. What would have cost us $10 at a local restaurant would cost us $50 at the hotel. To be expected. The food was good. There is a good Sunday buffet with lots of Asian fare (Chinese, Japanese, Indian) and a chocolate fountain to boot. Evening live music in the lobby. Most everyone spoke English.Taxis were waiting to take us into town or where ever we wanted to go from the hotel. We had only one issue with a cab flat our refusing to take us to our hotel from a place near the Zoo. We attribute this mostly to the Golden Week mad house and not the actual location of the hotel. The hotel had a easy English and Chinese map with directions to give to any cab.All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel if there are people who are looking for a great hotel at a great value. I think once this hotel is 100% finished and operational, combined with the neighborhood being fully developed and you're probably looking at rates being twice as high at least. Apr 5 2021 	Superb Hotel .WOW !!!!	Stayed here for a week and can't say enough about it, The food here is the very best the buffet diiners and breakfasts are out of this world. Our room was huge and spotless , great beds to sleep on after a hard days sightseeing. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. We shall be back.... Mar 7 2021 	Amazing Family Value for Northwest Beijing	We picked this hotel for its location, close to our son's boarding school and subway lines. We love China, but it sure was nice to be in this amazingly clean new hotel with its large beautiful clean pool and fitness center. Compared to other hotels in the area it is an amazing value, and it has the best pool we've experienced in China. Clean, comfortable rooms with comfortable beds. The high quality buffet breakfast has plenty of fresh fruits, omelets, pastries... It's a short walk to the #2 and #10 subway line so you can ride anywhere you need to go. We did have to pay extra for internet, and it was so new it wasn't on gps yet so hard to find. We are already booked to go back! Mar 2 2021 	Good short stay	Spend three nights at this hotel; from January 13-January 17, 2021. Upon arrival we were greeted by the bellhop, and the check in was a breeze. The room is nicely arranged with all the modern convience; the sitting stone stool in the shower is a big plus. My wife and I did utilize the gym and the indoor pool at the hotel; the free weights and treadmill keep us from gaining too much weight while indulging ourselves with good Chinese food. We had our breakfast every morning at the lobby restaurant; it is included with our room. The breakfast is good, you have your choice of American/Japanese/Chinese. However, I thought the dinner buffet was bit overpriced and the food wasn't that good. We never had the chance to dine at the other two restaurants at the establishment (Yunan cusine and Cantonese Seafood); perhaps next time around. There are plenty of restaurants near by the hotel, a short cab ride would get you there. The only negative part of this particular hotel is that it is brand new, and 3 out of 5 cab drivers required us to give them specific direction to get to the hotel. Overall, we liked this hotel: 1. the price $100 per night 2. the service 3. it is new. Feb 21 2021 	Great place but inconvenient location	Stayed there nearly 10 days while looking for an apartment. The price was very good and the hotel and rooms quite nice. Definitely 5-star decoration.However the location of the hotel is not convenient. It is close to nothing except some construction sites. You cannot go out in the evening for a walk, there is nothing to see, no restaurant, no shops, nothing. There is no taxi queue at the hotel so they have someone get you one from the street. The hotel is on a one-way street along the expressway. So when you get a taxi and wish to to to the city center or on Ring Road 3, the taxi is going in opposite direction and results in a detour of about 4km.On the other hand the subway (line10) is 10-15 walking distance and the best way to get around as if you take a taxi back to your hotel and even show the driver the hotel business card he will have no clue where this is. most of the time I had to help the driver with my limited mandarin.In any case, if you don't mind the location and are willing to take the subway, this ios great value. Nov 2 2008	Would Stay Again	We recently spent 2 nights here last week. We were pleasantly surprised with the size of the room and amenities. There is a very good breakfast buffet (by Chinese standards) that includes many pastries, an Indian section, Chinese section, Japanese section, juice, fruit, salads, hot foods with baked beans, broiled tomatoes, mushrooms, meats and to-order eggs. Also a waffle/pancake section. We never had as good a breakfast for the next 9 days. We stayed on the 12th floor. The glass shower door leaks out on the floor if it gets too much water on it. This was reported throughout our friends rooms. The views from our side of the hotel covered many of the national bird of china. The Crane. As in Construction. Oct 13 2008 	Yunnan comes to Beijing	A new (opened August 2008) hotel in Beijing's North East. Its got a Yunnan theme and a business/high end focus. At times there seems to be more staff waiting to serve than guests but this should hopefully improve as it becomes more widely known.Rooms are comfortable with a large bathroom. (Rainshower head and separate bath). Reported a couple of minor maintenance issues and they were fixed efficiently and graciously within 8 hours. Surrounded by construction activity, it looks a little isolated. (cannot hear construction tho, and wont last long given Beijings phenominal transformation rate).Easy to access from the third ring road if you're headed to the west but the one way road system makes it hard to reach if you are travelling the third ring road in an easterly direction. 5-10 minute walk to a subway station (Shaoyaoju). I got a electronic swipe card and travelled easily around the city. Subway has good graphics and English support for figuring out where to get on and off. Taxi rank that quickly gets you a cab if you want door to door service.Food and beverage on the dear side.Friendly staff with plenty of English speakers.(Didn't test other languages, sorry!)

"Oct 12 2021 	An average hotel that gets everything done well	I was in Beijing recently for business and i gotta saythat i was very pleased with the folks at Days Inn Joiest, Beijing. Although there was a lack of communication (i don't speak mandarin, they speak very little english) they tried their very best to help and accommodate us. Jan 20 2021 	A Complete Disappointment	To start I would never stay in this hotel again!Our tour agency guaranteed us that this was a four-star hotel and that was the furthest from the truth! Upon entering you had to endure the reeking smell of smoke. Interestingly enough there were no smoking signs plastered all over the place, but the waitress was kind enough to provide people with ashtrays. The overall quality of the hotel was very poor and not newly renovated like stated by our tour guide. Once in our room, we were greeted with peeling wallpaper, hair and dirt on the floor, a corroded faucet, and a nasty, small shower. The room was really small and very unclean. We were on a tour with three other people and they all had problems with their rooms. They were dirty, the heat didn't work in one room, and others smelled of smoke. When we complained, we were offered other rooms. They were slightly larger, but the same quality. There was even a hole in the bedspread in our &quot;better&quot; room.The only redeeming factor about this hotel was that the hotel staff was nice. They weren't always that helpful, but at least they were polite. Overall, I would never stay at this hotel again. It totally ruined our trip! Sep 24 2018 	Horrible reeked of cigarette smoke	Our tour accidently booked us in this hotel instead of the Days Inn Hotel and Suites on Hua Wei. On first entering the hotel, I was overwelmed with the smell of cigarette smoke. The lobby was drab and dirty. We were forced to spend one night here. We asked for a non smoking room and the desk person said we did have a non smoking room, but the room had an ash tray. The ventalation system was horrible and all night long we were stifled with cigarette smoke from other rooms. We opened the window. However, all night long metal workers were loading trucks under our window. We hardly slept at all. We were miserable. The staff was barely helpful when an alarm kept going off when we closed our door. Would never reccomend this hotel. Jul 25 2018 	Disgusting	My husband and I paid too much money to stay at this supposed 4 star hotel. It is a sub-par 2 star and that is only because they have a lobby and a door man. When I am done writing this review, I am going to give an earful to our 'travel agent'.The hotel is filthy. We stayed on the third floor and all of the carpets in the hall are stained badly, maybe from serious water damage. We decided to take the stairs to the morning buffet on the fourth floor and what a shock: years /decades of dirt and dust, piles of old furniture and garbage, not to mention the stairs were never finished and were just creaking wood and bare dirty cement walls.Our bathroom was never cleaned properly. Each day we'd return to our room to see gross stranger's hair and debris behind the bathroom door. We asked for our shower drain to be cleaned and it never was. Every shower we took the shower overflowed (no bathtub).Please don't stay here. I'm sure you can find much better accommodation elsewhere for a decent price. May 29 2018	hallway insufficient lightings and not enough ventilation; non english speaking	i and my family stayed here for 3 consecutive nights. it was our very first visit to beijing last april 2018. first thing i noticed when we first checked in was there werent enough staffs in the lobby. didnt see any bell boys to assist with our baggages. hallways were very dark as lightings were very insufficient. and not much ventilation too. cant expect too much since this was an inn and not a hotel. hope management can make improvements especially 2018 olympic is 2 months away. Apr 22 2018 	I will go again!	I booked this hotel while staying in the &quot;Super 8 GuoMao&quot;, it was a good change. The hotel is pretty new, about 2 years old. Rooms are clean and modern. Reception staff spoke English reasonably well and were friendly and helpful. For this hotel you get a good discount if you buy their VIP card first. The booked single room was perfectly ok (in theory), but a little small, so I settled on a &quot;Queen&quot;. I was given a room really far away from the lift on the 3/F. Everything was perfect, but then at about am5:00 some machine noise started from above.Next night I was given another room, near the lift. No machine noise, but you have people walking by talking loudly all night. Next time I would probably take more time to choose a room.Pro:Nice buildingNice rooms, modern and clean, nice bathrooms tooGreat buffet breakfastNear subway (10 Minutes to CiQiKou Station, Line 5)Friendly staffClose to shopping area (ChongWenMen DaJie)Tiananmen and Wangfujing in (long, but less 1 hour) walk distanceCon:Some rooms may have machine noise problems (from the conference center above??)It's in a rather newly build commercial area with little typical Beijing restaurant options.It should also be noted that there are several bus lines in front of the hotel. All east going buses will bring you to CiQiKou subway, avoiding the 10 Minutes walk. Bus 23 brings you right in front of GuoMao Carrefour supermarket. Will stay definitely again next time. Dec 19 2017 	Loved Beijing	We found this hotel excellent, clean efficient, everything you could ask for in a Hotel Oct 2 2017 	Just getting started?	Hotel was relatively new when I was there (I think). There was some construction in and around the hotel. The facilities were great and clean. Prices were relatively cheap and the location was pretty good, however customer service was pretty awful.Food was good. Buffet had Hagen Daaz ice cream (served by an attendent... I guess his time was worth less than the ice cream). Wine and beer included (all you can drink).When we were checking out, they couldn't find a laundry bag and tried to charge us for it. We had some laundry done and they forgot to return the bag. They asked us to OPEN UP OUR LUGGAGE while they inspected for the bag. Personally, I think this is unacceptable. Sep 17 2017 	good for price	We stayed at days inn in August 07 for 3 nights. We booked through the hotels website which seemed to be the cheapest rate. The only problem we had was that we had booked a non - smoking room and they put us in a smoking room. When we asked to be moved they did so although their idea of a non smoking room was to remove the ashtray! Make sure when booking in at reception to state clearly what type of room you want.The staff were very helpful even though it was difficult at times as not many spoke much english. Rooms/hotel were clean and tidy. The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice.Overall valve for money was good, the only slight down side was that there were not many restaurants nearby and it was a 15 - 20 minutes walk to main sites. Jul 16 2017	Just consider this......	First of all, even tho Expedia sent us a confirmation # and an itinerary number, when we reached the hotel they had no record of our reservation. We just returned home and we tried to speak to someone at Expedia and got an operator in the Philippines after 15 minutes on hold and a disconnect; then another 15 minutes on hold to be told, &quot;we'll bring it up at our next meeting.&quot; Oh, yeah. Anyway.....As for the hotel..... As they say, &quot;location, location, location&quot;. This hotel looks nice and is quite modern. Love the clean white duvet covering on the silk comforter, the flat screen TV on the wall - even tho the CNN connection was very sporatic and BBC had picture and no sound, the shower had lots of hot water tho the glass enclosure had some sort of leak and it made the bathroom floor all wet. The funny thing about the place was that it didn't feel Chinese even a little bit. If you woke up in the room you could have been in Tucson!! As for the location, it isn't near much. Not even an underground station. It is on a busy business street so at night it is pretty desolate and not conducive to walking anywhere. You have to catch a cab to go any place and the Beijing cabbies have become very selective on where they are willing to take you. We were refused rides 4 out of 5 times we hailed one. This was our 3rd trip to Bejing and things have changed. I guess it was partially our fault because the hotel looks like a business hotel and we should have known better. Tho the description of the location being 1 km from the Forbidden City is a bit of a stretch. The congestion in the center of Beijing is unbelievable! Going to an appt. less than 5 miles away took us over 1:45 minutes and that included a cab, then running, then another cab then walking the balance of the way. Next time we'll select a hotel in a more walkable area or at least near an underground station. Each night we felt like we were captive in the hotel - no where to walk or too much trouble to try and find a cab.You decide. Apr 6 2017 	Great Hotel!	We (a group of 173 people/teenagers from America) have just returned from a 5 day stay at the Joiest Days Inn In Beijing and had an incredibly wonderful time! The staff was very friendly and helpful with answering any questions and exchanging everyones money. The rooms were very nice and spacious for a single or double occupancy. All rooms have flat screen HD TVs and a handful of English speaking channels (including HBO). The bathrooms were nice with the exception of the glass divider between the bathroom and the main room....you could see the person in the shower pretty well! The rooms were always cleaned and fresh towels were provided every day. There's even a little Mini-Golf course on the 2nd floor. The breakfast buffet was to die for!! They had everything and anything a tourist could want! Overall, this is one of the BEST hotels in Beijing China! Thank you. Dec 28 2006 	A Satisfied Stay	Our group of 14 relatives have just returned from Beijing Nanshan Ski Tour. We stayed 3 nights at this hotel in downtown Beijing and found the rooms fully to our satisfaction. However luggage delivery to our rooms were a little slow. Moreover on the last day, hotel staff forgot to pickup luggage from outside our rooms as pre-arranged. Apr 22 2006	Great Value for Money Hotel	Stayed at the Days Inn Joiest Hotel reluctantly at first since I could not find any reviews at all. But my travel agent insisted it's a nice hotel, newly opened and at a very good rate for budget travellers. I found the hotel to be a good one for its price. The lobby is quite similar to a hospital lobby though but the rooms are spacious and comes with new gadgets including a plasma tv in all the rooms and the bathroom gadgets are all new including a massage3 shower and a hand held shower. The buffet breakfast at the 4th floor has a wide variety of western, Chinese and Japanese foods. The staff here at the restaurant and even at the reception has very limited knowledge of the English language like any other budget hotels in China."
"Top notch Western Hotel in China	We recently spent four nights at this hotel and were impressed by several things. First, the rooms are definitely 5-star and well maintained. Second the complimentary breakfast was the most broad selection of menu choices we'd ever experienced. Both hot and cold menu options, both western and traditional Chinese breakfast fare. Service by concierge and bell staff was excellent. We would highly recommend for a westerner who wants the comforts of home in the midst of China. Nov 26 2021 	Superb stay!	Even though we arrived at the hotel long before check in time, we were taken to our room straight away. From the moment we first entered the hotel until our departure nine days later, all of the staff were fantastic. All very courteous. True service with a smile. They made us feel very welcome.Our room was situated on the 11th floor. A very stylish and comfy double room. Sui Yuan restaurant on the 3rd floor is worth a visit, especially for the peking duck with pancakes. It was to die for and at such a good price (8 GBP for a whole duck!). We were with three people and had a lot of duck left, because it was huge.The waitress was very pro active and offered to have two other dishes made of the duck. They were also excellent.Drinks at the bar on the ground floor are nice after a long day of sightseeing (they do a good Singapore sling).I don't fully agree with some of the other reviewers about the location of the hotel being a minus. As Beijing is a massive city, getting around basically takes time from any part in town. It doesn't really matter where you are, in rush hour ( 7-9 am and 5-7 pm) any ride will take long. Other than this, none of the temples and places of interest are in one part of town anyway. So no matter where you are in between the 1st and 2nd ring road, you'll have to travel! I thought this was quite pleasant too. Taxis are cheap and with traveling around the different areas you get to see a lot. Ask the concierge to write down the places you want to visit on a card in Chinese. This definitely saves a lot of heartache as a lot of taxi drivers don't speak English.Xi'dan area is a very trendy area with lots of big shopping malls and bars/restaurants. This area is approx 5 minutes by taxi from the hotel. At night this is a popular hang out for Chinese youngsters. Worth a visit at night.The Park Hyatt is a must for a meal on the 66th floor at China Grill or a drink in the bar on the 65th floor. The food is a real treat and the view is out of this world! All in all we had a superb stay at the Doubletree Hilton Beijing and would absolutely go again. Nov 17 2021 	Comfortable	Fantastic hotel that is managed by Hilton . Excellent breakfast ( I shared some pictures ).Kind and excellent staff . The pool water was cold in Autumn !! No body couldn't swim in that.Comfortable rooms and beds ( Really good beds ).Wireless internet in lobby.There is a big supermarket and a good CONFECTIONERY near hotel . Finding Muslim foods near the hotel is a hassle but you can buy vegetable pizza from Pappa Jonse restaurant. The nearest Subway station is not close to the hotel but you can walk to there and it takes about half an hour(ChangChun Jie station) or take a taxi to there. You can travel with 2 RMB to any station like Beijing Zoo.( There is a fantastic and cheap shopping center in front of Beijing zoo ( on top of Bus stations ) )I recommend Hilton hotels in Beijing to my friends.Sincerely Nov 2 2021 	very pleased very nice 5 stars	i booked 3 nights with my hilton points, was given a very nice 1 bedroom suite with acces to executive lounge, free great breakfast, evening hors d'oeuvres, drinks and wireless internet,i love it so now im staying 2 more nights in the same suite for less than 100$ with taxes, special deal at the front desk.im not pleased with internet 100 yuan, 15$ and location...10 mins taxi from nearest subway and it is very hard to get a taxi around subway stations or in the streets and had to wait up to 30 mins each time...very fustration in long winter months.everybody is very very nice and professional, i will come back for sure if i get the same deal, less then 100$ for 1 bedroom suite with acces to executive lounge. Oct 24 2021 	Excellent Management	Upon arriving to this hotel, the room accomodations were not up to proper standards. Though the hotel was booked, the on-duty manager, Kenny, went far above and beyond the call of duty and not only fixed the problem, but did so with great professionalism, proficiency, and attentiveness. I and my colleagues are now very pleased with Kenny's efforts and the response of his staff, and we would highly recommend this hotel to other travelers. Oct 19 2021 	Amazing service and awesome staff	I must say that they have a fantastic team! Very helpful, friendly, a true service with a smile and professional (from Concierge to Front Office, Restaurant, Room Service and Housekeeping). Not a single complaint from me and my friend. This being my first trip to Beijing, I was clueless...Ray and the rest of his concierge team assist us with travel tips and transportation arrangement. Staying in Doubletree by Hilton Beijing felt like a home away from home. Oct 12 2021 	Everything's good except for the location	I booked this hotel via Expedia during their 2-for-1 promo. This hotel is quite new, probably built just in time for the Olympics last year. All in all, this hotel is grand and beautiful. The exterior and the interior are both very western and modern. Rooms are on the small side, judged by US standards, but very functional. By the way, loved the long sectional sofa/coach/chaise along the floor-to-ceiling window. The amenities are adequate of the Hilton standard. Restaurants serve good breakfast buffet and decent meals. Tip: there is another breakfast buffet location up on the business floors, if you want to escape the hectic crowd in the main hall - but choices of food items are limited at this location. All in all, quite satisfied with the services and the price I paid. One thing - although this hotel is located just outside the 2nd Ring Road on a main avenue, it is actually not close to any major sites or a subway station. Sometimes, taxis are hard to find. And often, you end up sitting in the traffic for a long time to get somewhere. Oct 9 2021 	5 star luxury at a 3 star price	As its a relatively new hotel, all facilities are fresh and new. A grand entrance hall awaits you where your bags are taken to your room after check in. All staff were particularly friendly and welcoming. On the ground floor there is a sublime warm and cozy bar, adjacent to the restaurant / breakfast room. The rooms are modern and spacious, with the finest decor and facilities. The hotel also features a 3rd floor outdoor roof garden, swimming pool and health spa. A 4 star rating doesnt really do it enough justice. Sep 9 2021	nothing was too much trouble - friendly clean and beautiful	Lovely hotel with beautiful rooms. Staff friendly and helpful - nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast wonderful, as there was a large Chinese food counter and also a well stocked Western breakfast counter. Noticing that I was breakfasting alone, a friendly girl attendant brought me a newspaper to read and that was typical of the kind of service you got there. The air-con control was difficult to work out but when I phoned reception, someone came within a few minutes and sorted it with a smile..The fitness suite and pool were spotlessly clean, attractive and fresh.The hotel reception coped admirably and were not fazed by the arrival of 140 of us - even giving us padlocks for our luggage when we left for an overnight train journey.It's not central but the location is pleasant and - yes - taxis are cheap. Aug 17 2021 	Book an Executive Floor Room and enjoy the view and SUPERB services t the Executive Lounge.	Excellent services from Front Desk, Concierge, Car Attendants, Executive Lounge staffs are SUPERB...Nearby Subway Station is just a Taxi ride away (about 10-15 CNY)! Aug 2 2021 	I enjoyed being there!	Excellent Breakfast, Charming personnel, Real Exchange Rate with no extra fees but not more than US $ 300! Jul 18 2021 	Very good service and hotel decoration	This is the best hotel in Xuan Wu District, Beijing. Hotel is very new and staff is very warm and friendly. Wonderful faclities, swimming pool on the rooftop garden very good feeling after a hard day work. I will definite come back to this hotel on my next trip. Jul 12 2021 	Doubletree-Beijing - Great Room Front Desk Conceirge and Service	My wife and I recently took our 13 year old Grandson to Beijing. We booked early with the Doubletree and worked via phone and email with their Conceirge team to help plan our stay. They were terrific. They arranged guide services, tours, and evening events before our arrival. When asked, they made adjustments to the plans and were simply a joy to work with. And the breakfast buffets had Grandson Will's eyes popping. The food was terrific, interesting, and plentiful. The service crew was also very good. Our 2 bedroom suite was spacious and very comfortable.We really did get 5-Star treatment throughout our stay. Thanks Doubletree-Beijing!! Jul 7 2021 	Great Hotel helpful staff but ......	We stayed at the Doubletree for 4 nights on the last leg of our trip to HK and China. It is a great hotel, very modern and our room was excellent; it is quite quirky to have the glass wall in the bathroom, as can be seen from the photos posted by other members. The breakfasts were everything you would expect from a hotel of this class and we also enjoyed the meals we had in the restaurant, which we also thought were very reasonably priced. There was nothing actually that we could find fault with about the hotel, ..... apart from it's location. For us, it was a little too far from the centre of Beijing. Because of the location we were the first 'pick up' for our tours (usually at 7.00am) and then the coach would spend up to 2 hours picking up from other hotels. At the end of each day we were the last couple to get dropped off - normally around 6.00pm. No criticism here, and each tour was completely fantastic, but it did mean that we really felt that we couldn't face travelling back into the centre of the city at night. It sometimes felt like quite an ordeal facing the very heavy traffic. This was the only small complaint that we had and this is the only reason that I wouldn't recommend the hotel to a friend. We organised a tour of the Hutongs through the concierge and our guide for this was delightful and I'd like to recommend her to anyone out there planning to visit Beijing. Her name is Skye and she would be happy to arrange tours to the Hutongs, the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, Temple of Heaven etc etc. If anyone wants an excellent guide, or any tours organised, in Beijing, feel free to contact me and I will let you have her email address. Jul 5 2021 	Good service Comfortable room Nice rooftop garden	I've been this Doubletree for 5 days, which located in long historical district of downtown Beijing, It has friendly service, good restaurants, comfortable rooms, so many wonderful art works, and especially a pretty good rooftop garden including an in-door swimming pool near the seperate spa rooms and gym. That's totally an unforgetable experience in Beijing. Jun 28 2021 	Terrible location 	We stayed at the Doubletree for 5 nights while visiting Beijing. The hotel turned out to be a disappointment. Its location is not near any of the major Beijing attractions. There are bus stops near by but with the heavy traffic congestion in Beijing, it takes about an hour by car to get to Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven or Olympic Village. Metro is the best bid but metro stop is not near by. You'll have to take a taxi or bus to get to the metro stop. Beijing Taxi is just like in NY City or any other major city, you better have a idea of the distance and cost. The Concierge desk is just too busy trying to get us to go on a package tour every time we ask for directions. We asked for a City map at the concierge but this hotel had no map what so ever. We were given a faded copy of metro map in black &amp; white. We asked for directions to Mutianyu Great Wall and was told that there were only two ways to get there 1. Join a tour for $320 Chinese yuan (about $50 US) per person or 2. Hire a Hotel car for $600 Yuan (about $95 US). I found out from the Information Desk at the Forbidden City to take the dedicated Bus line #6 to Mutianyu Great Wall for $50 yuan (about $8 US) round trip. Another disappointment, our room was not serviced after the first night. We got back to the room at 10 pm to find the room not cleaned or made up. We were just too tire to be bothered. I told the front desk next morning and thereafter was fine but no wash cloth. The swimming pool was not open during our stay.There is restaurant onsite but pricy. You can go to the restaurants across the street for a great meal for 1/3 of the cost. Don't be afraid to mingle with the locals, we found great food and value than the hotel would tell us. The room rate does not include breakfast or internet access. There is additional $120 yuan (about $20 US) for 24 hours internet connection which is very high. Overall, the hotel is new, the room size is same as that of a typical hotel in the US, quiet and comfortable. The location is not desirable, not convenient or near any attractions. The concierge service is poor and hard to get any information. We had great time in Beijing with many thanks from tips provided by locals and City Information Office. May 30 2021 	Great hotel - excellent rooms - real value for money	The Doubletree was opened for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008. Accordingly everything is still very new. Rooms are very spacious and extremly clean. And though the guests are mainly from Asian countries the breakfast buffet is great also for European travellers seeking an Continental Breakfast. Access by public transport is fine. Though a little bit remote, the next subway station is a 5-10 min. 15-20 CYN ride away. Close to the hotel you find a number of authentic low budget Chinese restaurants, if you don't want to eat in the hotel. I can fully recommend the Doubletree Beijing both for Business and Sightseeing in Beijing. May 22 2021 	Clean oasis in Beijing	It was a pleasure to come back to this hotel each evening. I stayed for three nights.The room was clean, modern and very comfortable. The service for breakfast was outstanding. The front desk staff were also excellent. The only minus was that you could hear some traffic through the windows. I would stay here again. May 18 2021 	Has potential	We stayed here for three nights as part of our 15 days customized china tour. It's fairly new so the rooms were clean and the decor very modern--there were some issues with my parent's bathroom door with the knobs falling apart and the toilet in our room not flushing well, but they fixed it quickly the next day. the heater doesn't work during spring time so had to turn off the central cooling system. the rooms were quiet--as they recently completed all construction. one complaint that I have is the service--but the service sector seems to be a problem throughout China as it lags desparately behind its economic growth (which is a pity as it makes China a very unattractive place for future visits). For a self-proclaimed five star hotel, the people at the check-in counter do not smile or greet their guests as they should -- I was standing at the counter for over five minutes waiting to change money, right in front of the lady receptionist who was looking down at whatever she was doing -- I was waiting for her to look up and say hello but she never did, so I had to speak up first and say &quot;excuse me, can you help me change money please&quot;? She then replied, &quot;okay, wait-a-minute please&quot;--like I wasn't waiting for SEVERAL Minutes already!.....I casually mentioned this to my tour guide however, and she reported this to her boss who called the hotel--the next day, I received a personal apology from the assistant manager who also provided fruits for us in our rooms. The man at the concierge was not very helpful either--he too never looked at us while he was talking and was very inpatient. My husband had broken his camera lens and we needed to find a replacement, but all he was able to do was point across the street and said to wait for the morning to go there. My husband went that night and saw absolutely no electronic stores, it was just a mall full of department stores! We went the next morning to ask another guy and at least he was smart enough to look through the internet for a place, although it was 2 hours away from the hotel. well, good thing our tour guide new of a cheap electronic center just FIVE minutes away from the hotel! Most of the workers (especially waiters) did not speak any English at all which made communication difficult (this is not expected for a &quot;hilton&quot; hotel). Overall, nice comfortable rooms but service can be variable depending on who you get stuck with--definitely room for improvement. Of note though, we did call 3 weeks after our stay to see if they can help us contact our tour guide, and a lady by the name of Louisa was very diligent in helping us acquire that number. One last thing, hotel is far from city center and traffic from one place to another is HORRIBLE! Apr 12 2021 	Chic and very modern with excellent staff	I stayed here with my wife, mother and sister-in-law for 3 nights. Overall, we were very impressed with how helpful everyone was and the overall layout and design of the hotel.Location: If you are wanting to sight-see, this hotel is somewhat out of the way of that. It is in the south-west of the city. We took the #7 bus to the subway, which took about 15 minutes. The subway is not within walking distance. The only two monuments that I could walk to where not that impressive.The staff speak excellent English and are very helpful. We booked the great wall tour through them. It is 400RMB/person for an all day tour as well as the Ming Tombs as your first stop. Our guide (Lu Lu) was great! Her english was excellent and she was very knowledgeable. They picked us up at 7am and we got back around 6 or 7. However, be forewarned that they also stop at a traditional chinese medicine place where you can pay 20RMB for a 10 minute foot massage and receive a quick pulse and tongue examination and diagnosis. The price is good, so we did it.  The doctor was actually pretty impressive as just by feeling my wife's pulse, he could tell that she had sinus problems. They of course then recommend some herbal treatment, which is kind of pricey. Being as we live in Changsha, Hunan as teachers, we will check out the prices here.The hotel was very modern and chic. Our guest room did not have a tub, but the shower was great. A nice overhead shower head with great water pressure. The 21st executive lounge is nice for relaxing and if you are an honors member, you can also check in there if you arrive while a huge tour group is downstairs in the lobby.The breakfast is nice.The coffee lounge was nice too. 40RMB or so for a mocha and/or latte/ cappicino, but the cups are large and it was very good.The Miso soup was excellent.The location is quiet, but as I said, you are a little ways away from both restaurants and sights. With the side that we were on, we bordered an executive building, so we could see right into their office, and I'm sure vice-versa. :) Apr 10 2021 	Great hotel friendly and helpful staff	Although on the west side of Beijing, the hotel was perfect for our three day visit. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The room was large and well maintained. The food in the two restaurants within the hotel was outstanding.Overall a great stay. Jan 23 2021 	Doubletree by Hilton Beijing	I was in many Hilton Hotels around the world but this is so so no good no bad. This hotel still under construction, 80% of this hotel is empty like the other hotels in Beijing. The ubication is far far away from the center and principal atractions, spend 50 yuans round trip and the traffic is terrible, worse than in New York or the 395 in Washington DC, busy busy traffic all day....i was in the suite for 10 days and was too noisy and cold, the quality of this hotel is not the best u can feel the cold and the noise of the traffic through the window there are an open window between the windows and that is why the room is cold and u feel the wind.Because of this problem my girlfriend get a flu for the next week really bad-well no the chicken flu eh!!-The hotel is nice looks like a 5 stars hotel have huge cold areas and the employees walking around like in Siberia.The restaurant is nice good food, good service, People speak english, tours in cash -bad-For the price i recomend another hotel in the center if u make numbers plus the taxi and tips and the time i recomend other hotel there are more than 2000 new hotels in Beijing and today for the crisis are empty...and the best are cheap, This hotel is good for business no for honey moon only for stay 3 days or less nothing around and most of the taxis dont know where is this hotel.Beware with the price looks cheap but the charges are so expensive.The happy hour is good, but i think the best is in the Hilton Bangkok.After this hotel we move to a new hotel in the center close to the New Trade Center Mall and was the best choice cheap warm and close to everything and the taxi only 10 yuans. Jan 6 2021 	Fantastic Hotel	I am a seasoned traveller. I stayed for 3 nights at this hotel with my daughter and wife. The hotel was new and I loved the decor. I have stayed in many hotels (some that were technically in a &quot;better&quot; class). However, this hotel gave me the best experience/feeling ever. The combination of a nice new hotel with the friendliest, most helpful staff I have ever come across made this stay memorable. I will all travellers to Beijing could experience this hotel. No, it is not the most central hotel. However, taxies are inexpensive. Bring a card from the hotel with the address and give it to the cab driver. This brought us directly to the hotel every time. I suggest brining a map from the hotel also. This seemed to work well. I would LOVE to go back to this hotel.My sentiments are shared by wife and 8 year old daughter. Nov 26 2008 	New Hotel but Far From CBD	New hotel. Service was nice and friendly. Excellent 5 star hotel. Only downside, as a prior reviewer mentioned, is that taxis don't know where the hotel is. They frequently take you to the Hilton instead of the Doubletree. This problem will resolve itself though as taxi drivers become more familiar with the hotel.The hotel itself is about half an hour from the Haidian district by taxi and in a residential district. There is a local shopping mall about a block away with a Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Yoshinoya (Japanese fast food chain featuring beef over rice), Xiabu Xiabu (Chinese hot pot chain), a supermarket and other stores. Also, a KTV nearby if you're up for it. Nov 7 2008 	Customer Service is second to none at Doubletree	My partner and I have just come back from a weeks holiday in Beijing. we stayed at the Doubletree. The hotel is very new and only opened 2 months ago, so everything is very clean, new and shiny. The rooms are very comfortable and quite spacious and you have a choice of a rainshower or power shower in the bathroom. The hotel is not centrally located within walking distance to Tianamen Square or the Forbidden City and shopping district Wangfujing like all the other 5 star western hotels but you would pay almost double for the same quality and comfort. It is very easy to get a taxi to the centre only 10 mins and costs around £1-2 pounds which is nothing. There are also buses just outside the hotel which will take you to the centre for the princely cost of 10p (1 yuan).The conceirge service is fantastic. They were very friendly and helpful and catered to our every need, from arranging our private tour and negotiating us a good price to running around the streets trying to find us a taxi during rush hour.There's an outdor pool which was closed as it was winter time and a very nice gym and spa, which makes a difference from the usual pokey hotel gyms and spa areas.Everyone in the hotel made you feel very welcome and I would certainly stay at the double again if I ever went back to Beijing! Aug 31 2008 	Loved the Doubletree	New Hotel. completed July 2008.We stayed there for the Olympics and had a wonderful experience.The staff were all very friendly and could not do enough for us.Meals in the all day restaurant were buffet style or al a carte and very good choices.The rooms were excellent, spaceous light and airy , Bathrooms modern light and very clean.Rooftop pool and gardenAlthough not in the centre of Beijing there are always taxis outside the hotel and they are very cheap, takes about 10 mins to the centre.Only drawback is taxis keep taking you back to the wrong Hilton, this may be because it is so new, hopefully the Hilton Group will sort this problem. Oct 9 2021 	Nice and kindly"
"Aug 13 2021	Great hotel	Stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China. Of all the hotels we stayed in this was our favourite. Very elegant hotel with huge rooms. Beds large and very comfortable. There was free internet access in the rooms. The restaurant buffet was excellent and catered for all tastes . It was very good value with dinner for around £8 , breakfast also great with lots of Asian dishes along with the usual bacon eggs etc. Dec 23 2018 	Very nice stay	The hotel stay was very good, breakfast was plentiful and had anything you could desire.Pros: * Hotel facilities * Room size * Breakfast * LocationShortcomings: * Internet access in the room doesn't come cheap and is wired (not wireless) Aug 19 2018 	Empark - Very Comfortable Amenities	I stayed at the Empark for the entire month of August while I was working at the Olympics. Upon arriving and through the entire stay, the staff was very attentive to my needs. The only issues I have is that the beds are extremely hard, free wireless is only available in the lobby - wired service is available in your room for a reasonable fee (hourly or by day) and laundry (which is done next door) is extremely expensive. Being in China I expected laundry service to be a lot cheaper than western hotels. In the basement of the hotel (floor B2) is a vegas-like mall. Restaurants, small boutiques, spas &amp; a gym/pool that is free for VIP guests of the hotel. I swam a few times at the pool and worked out at the gym. Although the hotel claims the gym is open 24hrs, it isn't staffed round the clock and it often appears closed. The Golden Resources Cafeteria in the hotel is a decent restaurant that offers a buffet for breakfast and dinner. My stay included breakfast and I was never disappointed. They offer a good selection of cereals, juices and fruits, as well as an assortment of hot entrees, breads &amp; sweet rolls. The coffee is good too! Taxis are fairly easy to come by at the hotel but keep in mind the hotel is located in the northwest part of the city and many of the historical attractions and shopping (Pearl &amp; Silk Market) are on the southeast part of town - expect a long cab ride. Fortunately taxi fares are inexpensive here.If you're coming to town for sightseeing, I think you would find this hotel too far out of the way (Summer Palace is the closest attraction). Aug 26 2017 	Great hotel...problematic communication	I stayed in Empark Grand Hotel for 4 nights (13-18/08), as I was participating in a conference held in the hotel.It was my first time staying in a 5 star hotel, so I was enthusiastic about the room and the hotel as a whole.It was very clean, quite impressive and well decorated. The food in the hotel's restaurant (lunch and breakfast) can be characterized as full. It had vegetarian menus, and seafood amongst others.The only problem I had was the communication part of my staying. The problem was that I was Greek, the reception manager was Chinese and we tryied to communicate in English, so we had to give much more effort than usual.In my lasta night there, I found out that there was a whole city underneath the hotel, but I didn't have time and courage to visit it.As a general, my staying there can be characterized as very pleasant. VagelisAthens, Greece Jul 18 2015	Perfectly Good Hotel	Stayed here for five nights in the spring. A very comfortable hotel with all the amenities I needed. Helpful staff who speak good English. For about $100 per night US (including breakfast, which was satisfactory but not great), it's a very good deal. I guess there's a whole underground 'city' somewhere on the grounds, but I never got around to it. The rooms are quiet, comfortable, well-appointed, and if you're used to a 3-to-4 star place in the states, it will suit you fine. The beds are HARD AS A ROCK, but I found that to be the case everywhere else I went in China, too. Seems that's just how they do beds over there.The location could be a problem for some. It is in the Northwest of the city, not in a walkable part of town. A taxi to the city center (Tiananmen Square area) takes about 20-30 minutes in (always) bad traffic. But then again, cabs in Beijing are very cheap...It's about a $7 fare. Cabs are readily available at the front of the hotel 24/7. Or just take a taxi to a nearby subway (for half that price) and take the train (for something like 25 cents)."
"Aug 4 2018 	Very good business hotel	Very good location on 3rd ring road. Near a nice mall with supermarket and Starbucks, and other food court type options. Room was very comfortable with all usual amenities/services of 4-5 star hotel. Must ask for nonsmoking hall since my second stay during trip was on smoking hall/room. The room was ok but walking down the hall with others who smoked and left the doors open was quite unpleasant.Restaurant was good for western and chinese foods. Breakfast was really good for all the options available.Lobby was attractive and staff was quite good. I found that the best service was from the asst mgr versus the young staff at front desk. They did all that is expected but English was only fair. Friendly to the max but communication is always a challenge.Cost was outstanding as booked by local customer, 580 rmb. May 8 2018 	Very Nice Hotel	Just got back from a 10 day stay in the Fujian Hotel in Beijing. Staff is excellent - front desk to housekeeping. I had a problem getting the WIFI to work and within 10 minutes they sent someone to my room to set it up. Free WIFI is the BEST!Room clean and pleasant,comfy bed, free fresh fruit provided every other day, mini bar with the usuals, free bottled water also provided- 2 in the am and another one at night. Full compliment of toiletries plus a razor, comb, sewing kit. TV with HBO and CNN for you non-Chinese speakers. Free Eng version of China Daily for the govt-issued news. Lots of sprucing up going on in April, I assume for the Olympic rush. Carpet in my room a bit worn, but I suspect it is on the renovation list. Small shop on ground floor for necessities. Breakfast buffet with all the Chinese and Western food you can want. I was charmed by the effort of everyone to greet me -an obvious westerner - in English, responding to my halting Ni hao with &quot;Good evening Madam&quot;. Dec 31 2017 	Excellent hotel at this price	Fujian Hotel is one of the best hotel I stayed in China. I have stayed there several times each year for the last several year. The price is currently around RMB 580. The staff is excellent and willing to accomadate your need. The internet connection has been improved a lot and is very fast now. In comparison with other hotels at this price I stayed in Beijing and Shanghai, this is the best. The breakfast is mixed with Chinese and western styles and is very good. The location of this hotel is very convinient, next to the third highway circle, 20-30 min from airport and easy to go to anywhere in Beijing. Jun 30 2017 	a week in Fujian	Hotel is a nice hotel. Difficutly finding people that speak English, but they do a good effort and are very hospitable and polite. The room service food is not at all what you'd expect coming from europe. Had a plate of salmon, but it came delivered half frozen. The main drawback to the hotel is that the Beijing international fair is a 20-25 minute cab ride and that the toilet is in the middle of the bathroom. Aside from that, the hotel is a very pleasnt stay. Hope you're not to much into watching TV caue you only have CNN and HBO in english. Mar 21 2016 	About what you'd expect	This hotel was booked for me by a client and I had no idea what to expect. However, it is just fine.A Chinese friend describes it as 'a new hotel'. Guests are a mix of Chinese and westerners. I guess the standard is similar to what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel in, say, Paris or Edinburgh and better than some I've stayed in in those cities. Good sized rooms - about what you'd get in the US.So not the stellar experience you'd get at the Marriott in Shanghai, but perfectly fine - and cheap.The staff were friendly but the standard of English was rather patchy - that's to be expected in Beijing at this time, though. Frankly, having turned up in China knowing five words of Mandarin and seven Chinese characters I didn't expect to be understood first time. So, for instance, I had trouble explaining that I wanted to iron my shirts (not wash them). Once that was sorted, room service was pretty speedy.The beds are very hard, but not uncomfortable. Pillows are man-made and rather spongy.Internet is free - which is great.The TV only had CNN and HBO in English - I didn't notice any other languages other than 30 or so Chinese channels, a couple of which had English subtitles.Food was not great but not bad - my room service lamb curry was far from what I'd expect in the UK, with chunks of pineapple on top, but the meat was good quality. The portion size was Chinese, not American, but that's not a bad thing!One interesting point, the entrance to the hotel is at the back of the building. The entrance at the front leads to a bank who are obviously used to hapless westerners turning up looking for accommodation."
"Sep 28 2021 	adequate	As far as I've noticed, this hotel is aimed mainly at large groups who travel across China. So, from that point of view, it's a typical city business hotel with a good location, spacious rooms and lots of facilities but with a lack of attention to a single guest. All they do is check-in and check-out - one groups comes, another one goes. The only thing to fault is the breakfast. Not much of choice, very crowded and noisy. Location is just across the corner of main shopping and walking streets. The highway in front of the hotel is busy, but I didn't notice much noise from it. Rooms were spacious and clean, bed - comfortable. Sep 27 2021 	A good choice for staying in Beijing	Stayed in 2016: very good at that time, even better now. On Sep 2021 we stayed at Gloria four nights. The location is convenient, few minutes walk to the underground station. In fact we reached the hotel from the airport by underground. Very good staff at the desk, english speaking. We choose a deluxe room: it was very large, always clean and completely renovated. The breakfast was outstanding: a wide range of western and chinese food. Price: a good deal.Definitely a good choice. Aug 13 2021	Disappointing	We stayed here as part of a Jules Verne tour of China.Compared to the other hotels we stayed in this one was disappointing. Rooms ok but they didn't provide enough toilet paper or replace used shampoos. There was internet access in the bedrooms but it was very expensive. Carpets etc slighty stained . Wardrobe area small and only a couple of hangers. Some rooms had bath robes but ours didn't . We had requested a non smoking room and were given a room on the non smoking floor but it stank of smoke so we insisted on moving to another room.The buffet dinner in cafe style restaurant was very good value but breakfast was poor. Too small a restaurant for the number of rooms so it was a bit chaotic, no where to sit , no staff to clear tables and food running out . Gift shop sign said it opened at 7am so I had planned to buy a few last minute gifts on the morning we left but it didn't open on time and reception said it might be 10am before it opened . Drinks, coffees etc very expensive .It did have a leisure centre and indoor pool but it was compulsory to wear a swimming cap which they charged approx £3 each for . May 21 2021 	Better than expected	We stayed here for 3 nights following a cruise and the hotel was a pleasant surprise. Our room was large and well appointed, clearly refurbished recently. The location is quite convenient, close to an underground station and within an easy walk of shops and restaurants. The worst thing was probably the restaurant which was quite basic and I would suggest walking out to others, for example the Marriott over the road. Breakfast can be crowded if you time it wrong and I suggest either going quite early (say 7.00am) or about 8.30. Choice was satisfactory if not very exciting Dec 6 2018 	Convenient location	The hotel is located within walking distance to Beijing railway Station and underground station, which is very handy for sightseeing. The lobby and public areas look nice, however the room furniture was a bit old. Breakfast buffet is good, but I would prefer more variety.The concierge staff very nice and helpful with very good level of English. Overall good hotel. Dec 2 2018	Even Better than Last Year	In our review last year we expressed satisfaction with this hotel with our only reservation being that although clean, the hotel rooms were a little &quot;tired&quot; and could do with some TLC. I am pleased to report that on our return to the hotel again this year for a four day stay following a cruise across from Vancouver we were very pleased to see that the information given to us last year had been carried out. They said that rooms would be largely stripped and redecorated. I cannot vouch for every room having been finished but our room this year was second to none. Deep pile carpets, new furniture and the beds were certainly a vast improvement. Excellent.Staff and restaurants excellent.Beijing was again a delight to visit and the city was obviously carrying on the celebrations from the Olympic Games. The city was truly covered in flowers and was a sight to be remembered.So where was all the polluted air - I seen worse back home in England. Clear blue skies every day.We travelled out via Terminal 5 at Heathrow and we were quite impressed at the time - that is until we travelled home through Beijing's Terminal 3 which made poor old Terminal 5 look like a rather large greenhouse. At 20% larger than all Heathrows terminals put together it was awesome - and surprisingly no objections to all the photographs being taken by the population at large.We cannot wait to visit again.Philip and Sue. Oct 24 2018 	Could use a remodelling	Nothing to report. Good location. Could use some remodelling but it perfectly suited our needs. Jun 13 2018	Good Hotel	We stayed at the Gloria Plaza at the start of a three week tour of China with VJV.It is a large comfotable hotel which well justifies its four stars.The rooms are large, light and airy and the bathrooms are of similar standard.The breakfasts are excellent. We did not try the other meals.Location is central and very good. Staff friendly and helpful, as they were at all the other hotels in China.The drinks prices were the most expensive we encountered in China. Not only alcoholic beverages, but also soft drinks and water.Top Tip. There is a little kiosk right next to the hotel. Buy your drinks there. There is plenty of space in the room fridge. The beers and soft drinks were good and the Great Wall red wine drinkable. We decided not to chance the &quot;Johnny Workers Black Labial&quot; Apr 15 2018 	A Great Deal Great Location Solid Hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Gloria Plaza for nine nights during our recent trip to Beijing (April 2018). The hotel is well situated, near the Embassy area, shopping, Forbidden City, etc...We found it clean and the staff very friendly. The food in the resurant was fair, room amenities nice, and overall service quite good.The staff will, no doubt, be learning more English, but we found the existing level of English fine. The hotel has a nice fitness room (included in your room rate), and serveral restaurants. This is my third stay (my wife's second) at the Gloria Plaza...We highly recommend it as a safe, well-situated, moderately priced hotel with very good service (in our case, we also had a panoramic view of the city, + CNN.. My next time in Beijing, I am heading to the Gloria Plaza.PS My only negative is the carpeting..time for an update. Jan 15 2018 	The worse hotel in China I have ever stayed	Well, we stayed there only one night and I can say that is the worse hotel in China I have ever been (and I stayed at least in 10 of them).The only plus is its location but just acros the road you can find another one which is much better (even if that one is not the best either- beijing International Hotel).1. Staff is rude and does not show any respect for their guests - which is very unusual for China or at least Beijing.2. Rooms are ugly and poorly equipped comparing with other hotels.3. Reservation was made for two single beds and after all me and my friend was offered to share 1 bed, because they had no enough of rooms and since it was late night and it was cold we had no other option. (The other guy had the same problem and he also had his reservation done 1 month in advance). So, it was not unlucky day for us only in this hotel.So, if you look for few days vacation in nice hotel. Check something else but Gloria Plaza. I can recommend Temple of Heaven, Holiday Inn. For the same or almost the same value you will find there all you miss in this old, ugly roomed hotel. Aug 19 2017 	Lovely hotel in central location	We stayed at the Gloria Plaza Hotel for 5 nights booked through Cosmos Tourama. The holiday was absolutely fantastic!We were picked up from the airport by by our guide, Sally, who along with our driver was at our service throughout the trip. We certainly got the V.I.P. treatment.The hotel has a grand spacious entrance and a nice lounge area where you can have a coffee or a drink and watch people coming and going. There is also a small shop in the foyer which is handy for picking up a snack, a last minute present or in our case a really handy fold-away rucksack.The hotel is very central and you get a great view from the large picture windows of the busy city. We enjoyed watching the people travel on their bikes carrying their wares.Our room was large, nothing grand, but with no complaints either. It had a nice picture window and was clean and tidy.The hotel has a fitness studio, swimming pool and beauty saloon. You have to wear a swimming cap for the pool and can buy them there.Only wish we had more time to make more use of the lovely pool.Breakfast was superb - buffet with everything you could possibly want and more. Chefs on hand to make you waffles, omlete etc. We had a buffet meal one evening which was very good. Cost approx £35 which included a bottle of red wine. A lady playing the Grand Piano was a nice touch.Although our driver took us everywhere the location was central and the Friendship Store is just up the road for some shopping and there is a McDonalds just round the corner if you want to eat McDonalds in China!!We did all the tourist things in Beijing. We enjoyed the rickshaw ride through the Hotung (Old Town) where we visited a Kindergarten and had lunch with a Chinese family - the food was wonderful. If you like markets and barganing, then try the Silk Market. I found the people a bit too aggressive and if it wasn't for our tour guide would have paid £35 for a handbag which she managed to get down to £7. Was dubious about the 'Diesel' t-shirts we bought for our son but they have washed well.The tour guides are obligated to take you to the Jade factory, silk factory etc. We found them interesting but the sales people in the Jade factory were pushy. The tour guide gets commission on purchases but is also charged if you do not visit the factory.We also took a day trip by plane to Xian to see the Terracota Warriers which was well worth a visit. Again we were taken to the 'factories' with pushy sales people but quickly made our exit and at least the tour guide has carried out her obligations.We made the most of our 5 days, learned a lot, walked the wall - came home tired but happy. Jul 20 2017 	Great Location marginal Room	Definately a 2 star hotel. We stayed here on a Pacific Delight Tour. The location is fabulous, however the hotel needs some serious work. The rooms were clean, but the usual signs of decay and dirty grout were all over. Good Stuff: Location (5 mins walk to Silk Alley, my China Construction ATMs, and a Beijing 2018 Olympic store). Close to Tianamen Square and some other good locations. Price: The morning buffet. Close to McDonalds. Close to a corner market with some water and chips available.Bad Stuff: the Room was marginal. It was clean, but certainly not stellar. If this hotel were fixed up, it would be very high on my list. Jul 3 2017 	Must be better hotels in Beijing	We selected the hotel due to its location which is excellent.On arrival, we were allocated a very small room, which smelt badly of smoke. We complained and were moved to a better room on the 8th floor. However, it was still rather shabby and we had problems getting the key to work.The staff on the front desk were terrible, and – despite speaking adequate English - were officious and unhelpful. On our first day they refused to change a travellers cheque as they claimed that the signatures were not identical(!) This could have caused us a great problem if we had not had our ATM cards.The staff in the restaurant were also very unhelpful (one morning we had to ask 4 different people for a spoon!) Smoking is allowed in the restaurant (even at breakfast), and there is only one small ‘no smoking’ area, although ironically this is the furthest point away from the buffet! This means that there were several people smoking heavily, sitting only inches away from the breakfast buffet, which most Western people will find rather unpleasant.If you chose to have dinner in the restaurant, the food is bland, the service is poor and you will pay approximately double what you would pay in a nearby restaurant.The concierge was polite and helpful, and did recommend a good local restaurant.We enjoyed Beijing tremendously. Based on our experiences of the Chinese people in general (polite, helpful, eager to please etc.), I am sure there are better hotel options available.Nearby places to eat: •‘Emporer Duck’ on the main road (ask the concierge for details)•Pizza Hut (if you need a break from Chinese food … spotlessly clean, efficient service and very cheap) Apr 14 2017 	Good location facelifting required.	Stayed there five days in 2016 november. Bed&amp;Breakfast. Very convenient location - several subway stations from center, no problems to get there by taxi even when the traffic was busy. Got a very good view from our room - ancient tower with some old astronomy tools on top and old Beijing city wall. But the room needed radical repair - not terrible, but too out of date, especially the bathroom. Rooms clean but not very clean. Breakfast was OK, we had no problems. Restaurants and service - very good. Personnel - helpful. So the rooms finishing and appliances is not 4 stars, everything else - defintely is 4 stars quality. A good place to drop your luggage and do Beijing sightseeing. Mar 16 2017 	Exceeded our expections	Having read some the the reviews on this hotel, we were a bit concerned. However, our experience was nothing like the other reviewers. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and the public areas were clean and well-maintained. The breakfast buffet had something for all cultures and tastes. Granted the scrambled eggs and bacon were a little less done than our preference, but there were other options. We did not have a massage, regrettably, but another person in our tour group did and was very pleased, especially for the cost--about $25US. We walked in the area and felt safe. Beware of the local pedicab drivers--we had one who tried to charge us $200US!! While in Beijing, do NOT miss a tour of one of the hutongs--our favorite part of the trip, getting to meet locals, etc. Mar 3 2017	Awful	Unless this hotel has been demolished and rebuilt over the last couple of years when we visited, avoid. We stayed here for a couple of nights before a Princess cruise. Our room was disgusting - dirty,dark,worn furniture and stinking of smoke. We were shown to our room via a wedding reception ( sorry folks) , the hotel kitchen ( we didn't eat in the hotel) and the service lift. The public areas looked ok but the corridors and rooms were worn and dirty. also, the staff were not particluarly helpful and failed to conatct us when our tour guide arrived. ` They also made no effort to deal with our complaint re the room. Jan 27 2017	3 star hotel in need of a face -lift.	Stayed in Gloria Plaza Hotel for 5 nights this January, and even though it definetely is not a 4 star hotel, people should expect a pleasant stay in a 3 star hotel. The lobby is quite large , but the reception stuff even though not rude are not wellcoming. The rooms are quite spacious but worn out and in need of a renovation . Breakfast was okay , with an omellete and waffle station, but it seems like non smokers are not appreciated and people can smoke anywhere they want... The hotel pool and the sauna were a plus and the price catalogue for the spa services quite reasonable.The subway station is very near the hotel, but what with the taxis being sooooo cheap it really is a lot better to just ask the bell boys write on a paper the place you are interested in going in chinese ( cab drivers do not speak english AT ALL !!! ) , rather than waste your time with the metro.... Near the lobby there is a desk where you can book your excursions , but it is a lot more expensive rather than booking them at the airport upon arrival. All in all, we had a pleasant stay in Beijing and did not have any problems with the hotel even though I have to specify that in deed the hotel is a bit worn out and needs a renovation. Sep 29 2016	Awful in parts	Walk out of pleasant public areas into filthy corridors and scruffy bedrooms, sheets spotless but carpets filthy and covered with burns, grubby walls and furniture. Breakfast has potential to be good but could not cope with number of customers, only one bright spot - lovely supper&gt; Sep 27 2016	I'd look for a better hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Gloria Plaza Hotel for 5 nights between 9/21 - 9/26. The hotel location is great, which is probably the only good thing about this hotel. It is very close to a subway station, and Silk Street and other main tourist attractions are couple stops away.The lobby of the hotel is nice, and certainly gives you hope. The check in experience was certainly interesting. I don't know why, but it seems that chinese people culturally just simply don't respect the concept of a line. Before anybody flips out, I am chinese, but spent most of my life in the US. My husband is american. Anyways, there were clearly velvet ropes available in front of every person at the check in counter, but people would just walk up and talk to the check in person, and the check in person would do nothing to rectify that. Finally I just got fed up and told the intruder to get to the back of the line. The staff at the hotel is more or less not friendly. THere was no greeting, no &quot;welcome to our hotel&quot;, just asked me for my last name, form of payment, sign here, and handed me the key. I'm not sure if that's just their standard way of operating or it was a fluke since there was a huge tour group checking in. Anyhoo, 0 points for hospitality so far.Changing money with my traveler's checks was also a nightmare. Apparently the hotel staff has never seen a check that has two authorizing signatures, so that took a while to sort out. THe rooms were at best, livable. Definitely not 4 stars. Beds were hard, bathroom was moldy and gross, and the carpet was suspect. They do give you slippers, so definitely use those, as well as bathrobes. Bring an alarm clock, I'm not sure why they don't have one.Three days in a row my room keys did not work when I got back to my room with bags of stuff. I demanded an explanation, and I got the usual &quot;you must have your key near a credit card, cellphone etc.&quot; which is certainly not true since I had none of those on me. Mind you, this happened to both our keys, which was carried separately by me and my husband. Breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about. They had a mixture of western and eastern food. As well as an omelet station and waffle station. Get there before 8:30 if you can, to beat the tour group rushes. They don't do a very good job of refilling food.So overall, I doubt I'd stay there again.As a side note, due to the Chinese national day, 10/1, as well as the upcoming 2018 olympics, a lot of the main attractions within tourist sites are under renovations. Just ask when you buy tickets what's opened and what's closed, but even then you may not get a straight answer. When possible, buy an all inclusive ticket, or they'll nickel and dime you for every temple you want to check out. Apr 7 2016	Great Hotel	Just returned from a 5-night stay at the Gloria Plaza Hotel in Beijing with a group of 26 people. Everyone thought this hotel was fabulous. Location is the greatest feature of this hotel. Breakfast buffet was awesome, with made-to-order omlets. Rooms were clean and spacious, but looked a little worn or &quot;tired.&quot; Although bathroom was covered with white marble tile, it looked old. Grout was missing in some places, and faucets and shower head were old, but mirror was very large and semi wrap-around. A face-lift of the rooms would do wonders for this otherwise great hotel. Lobby and dining rooms were fabulous as they were recently refurbished. Staff was most courteous. Would definitely stay there again. Feb 25 2016	Helpful staff and good location	I stayed here and arrived very late at night. The staff couldn't change any money but were most helpful in tidying me over until the exchange desk opened in the morning.I wanted to visit some nearby shopping centres and asked to book a car. The staff advised that it would be cheaper $ 2.00 to take a taxi each way than book a car for $30.00.Hotel restaurants were good and rooms were clean and spacious.Local restaurants and convenience stores within a few minutes walk of the hotel although English is a bit of a problem but got by on sign language.All in all an excellent hotel and location. I have just booked to stay there again this year. Dec 15 2005	Great Breakfast Buffet; Dim Sum restaurant expensive	The strangest thing I noticed was that there were no alarm clocks in the rooms. I guess you could arrange a wakeup call. But with jet lag, it was hard to tell time without a clock.The dim sum restaurant on the ground floor is quite expensive, meaning paying like you're in PF Chang's. But if you'd go out, you could probably find cheaper places. They had 2 girls serving you hand and foot.September temp/weather was perfect, although we did have a rainy first day. Nov 11 2005	Great location	We enjoyed our stay here. My husband, two friends and I stayed here for a week. The buffet was extensive. The staff friendly and helpful, especially the bell services. After a full day with a cab driver whom we had decided was more a friend than a driver, a bell service person helped us communicate our gratitude. Aug 24 2005	Very good hotel	I would like to inform people who might be visiting Beijing China, and want to stay at Gloria Plaza hotel, that it's a very good hotel, with high standard.The rooms are clean, with private bath, TV, a/c, mini bar, and electric kettle.You have every day, complementary 2 bottles of water, free of charge, and the rooms are spacy and most important clean.The breakfast at the hotel is very rich, with variety of cuisine and taste.The people at the hotel were very friendly with us, and tried to help us as much as they could.The hotel is very near the Silk market. You can even walk there, if it is not too hot and humid, and there is also a Metro station opposite the hotel if you want to move around with tube. Jul 24 2005	Go elsewhere!	The rooms are horrible and not very clean. I found someone else's hair in my bathtub as well as in my bed sheets. There are cigarette burns on the carpet and the furniture is old, threadbare and smells musty. Service is minimal and English is not very well understood when I called to inform them that the bathtub drain doesn't work very well. It took an hour for the bellbop to bring up my luggage and another hour for room service when they had quoted 20 minutes and they got my order wrong plus gave me attitude when I called it in! The quality of the buffet breakfast is not very good and the bed is rock-hard and feel that I may as well sleep on the floor. For the price, I suppose I should feel that I'm getting a good deal- but I think I'd rather pay extra for a 5-star hotel like the Sheraton Great Wall Beijing since this 4-star Gloria Plaza Hotel certainly does not live up to its rating. This place is sub-standard and best compares to the worst motels in the USA. Sep 22 2004	A pleasant stay	I stayed at the Gloria Plaza in November of 2002.This is a large, western style hotel, in the southeast of Beijing. It is on a main East West Avenue, and I was able to walk to many of the places I wanted to visit, as well as restaurants and shops.The room was large, even by western standards, clean, EVERYTHING WORKED!!! (well, actually it was always a bit overheated for my taste)The staff and concierge were helpful, spoke English but were willing to bear with my Mandarin, and seemed genuinely interested in conversation with me.The breakfast buffet was great.Don't miss the Ming Dynasty Jesuit Observatory Tower accross the steet. Nov 22 2021 	?????????? Nov 6 2021 	????? Nov 4 2021 	Bell'hotel! Jul 5 2018	Hotel mit gutem Preis Leistungsverhältnis"
"Oct 18 2021 	Great location huge rooms free internet - simple as that	I stayed at Grand Millennium 6 nights and truly enjoyed it. The only problem is that no taxi driver knew where hotel is - you have to show them the map, just name is not enough. The location tough is fantastic, everything is very close. I arrived at 6 am and although the check in officialy starts from 2 pm, lovely receptionist check me in at no extra charge. The Hotel has huge lobby, very impressive but leaves you feeling very cold. The decor is very neutral and is lacking some personal touches.The room was very big, very confordable, clean...no complaint. Bathroom is spacious with separate bath and shower. You can use internet for free, even if you don't have your own laptop, you can use huge TV and keyborad in the room. Very pleased with that. I was based on the 6th floor hence the horrible view but I guess you can't have everything. I do advice you to take higher level rooms, surely they will have better views, even if its burnt builidng opposite Grand. The restaurant is very nice, food ok, and as someone alredays mentioned tea is very weird! I booked one day trip through the hotel (400 RNB) to the Great Wall of China and Ming Tomb - I really enjoued it. It was fantastic - mostly thank you people I met on the bus and the tour guide. She even took us to traditional tea ceremony in central Beijing which you mustn't miss. Oct 3 2021 	Horrible service... poor attitude	First, the room is ok (there is a mark on the carpet, and smells like they use perfume to cover the smell of smoke). Location good for business traveller going to Guo Mao area. Not that great for leisure traveller as it is far from all attractions. Value - ask about promotions before you book or pay. They told us it is RMB$1000/night. Only after 3 hrs, when we asked about promos, they unwillingly told us about the promo of RMB$600/night.Major problem is the attitude and service. My collegue speaks fluent mandarin so it is not language problem. We went to the front desk without reservation on the Mid Autumn festival evening after a day of working. We told them, with proofs, that we work for this company with corporate rate of $600/night. The front desk said we couldnt use the corp rate without written approval in specific form. So we asked what is the walk in rate, she said $900+charges ~= $1000. After about 5 minutes of trying, we gave up. We made many calls to different hotels and agents etc, without luck. Then after 3 hours (of calls, upset, and then working in their lobby), we went back to the front desk, this time after my coworker asked, she told us there IS a promotion for RMB$600/night for the National Day. What a shame on them and on this National Day promo. If they told us 3 hours ago, we would have checked in 3 hours earlier. If my collegue didnt ask, we would never know. What kind of 5 star hotel is this? to hide its promotions from desparate corporate traveller who frequent the hotel way too often. Aug 13 2021 	Awesome Facilities/Mediocre Service	Stayed here and the Grand Hotel which are 2 5-star hotels and completely different. The GM has awesome facilities. One of the nicest pools/workout facilities i've ever seen in a hotel. Great great rooms and washrooms, free internet through flatscreen tv's with a wireless keyboard and a great breakfast. But the service was lame and inconsistent. The concierge seemed clueless and the checkin wasn't that friendly. Also they had no control over people butting in lines and checkin and checkout and the prices for tours and assitance was at least 200RMB more than the Grand Hotel (seems excessive for almost the exact same tours) Must commend the doormen however, they were really good.Also the location is in the CBD (right beside the CCTV building), so it ends up being a little bland. But if you're just worried about faciliities, this hotel was top notch. Jul 1 2021 	Luxury in the heart of Beijing	Very spacious and luxurious rooms with huge bathrooms, found the location very convenient being next to the subway station and a few minutes taxi to the main tourist destinations. Restaurants offered a wide range of eastern and western delicacies. Great view of the CCTV building and interesting to look at the burnt down mandarin oriental hotel next to it. May 29 2021 	Posh new hotel in an increasing posh city	We stayed 4 nights at the Grand Millennium in December. My husband and I visited Beijing with his parents, and all 4 of us enjoyed our stay very much. We got a good deal as well, as many new hotels needed to boost business after the decline in visitors post-Olympics.The rooms were fairly big and the bed very comfortable. Choice of pillows available. Heating was good. Bathroom was big and well equipped with bath tub and separate shower. Staff was helpful and polite. Not much smiling though, very business like. No trouble communicating with the reception, not as easy with the restaurant staff but I could practice my Mandarin. Buffet breakfast was great except the English tea tastes a bit different. If you drink Chinese tea then it's fine. The location was perfect because it was in the heart of the financial centre, right next door to where our expat friend was living. Less than 30 min from the airport (except rush hour as the traffic in Beijing can be quite a nightmare) by taxi, which costs about 100 RMB. Since the financial district is the new trendy area, restaurants around here tend to be more expensive (100+ RMB pp) but also better quality. Try the restaurant inside the Ritan Park and the hotpot place across the road. We also tried some local dumpling places in the old city Hutongs (alleys), where the 4 of us were fed for a mere total of 15 RMB. This gives you an idea of the rich-poor gap in this city.Beijing in December was freezing (-10 oC by day) and we went everywhere in the city by taxi, which was so cheap. Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City etc all within a 30 RMB (15 min) ride. For the Olympic village we took the brand new subway line. So cheap. For the Great wall and summer palace (further out from the city), our friend arranged chauffeur service at 600 RMB for a whole day. The hotel would arrange that too, perhaps a bit more expensive. The bit of Great wall that we went to (Badaling) was very popular amongst tourist, hence with better facilities (gondolas for those who do not wish to walk, even a roller coaster for the downward trip). Our driver suggested that next time we can try the 'wild Great wall' sections - no hand rails, no staircase, no toilet, no souvenir shops, but he did not recommend that for our parents.All in all, Beijing is a city with something for everyone. From the spectacular forbidden city to the charming alleys still filled with the smell of coal, to the trendy art shops in the 798 art district. (798 used to be a weapon factory), we enjoyed our stay very much. You still see the 'flying swords' (spitting) once in while, usually by older men, but the general population are very friendly to tourists, thanks to the Olympics effect. And the Grand Millennium is a posh new hotel to explore the improving city. Mar 25 2021 	Excellent Hotel Will Return On My Next Visit	Room:What can I say! This room was new, large and luxurious! Spacious work desk (with free internet). Comfortable bed with reading light and Large LCD TV. Day bed was also provided beside the Window and gave a good view of the City. Toilet area was hugh and connected to the room (you could pull a sliding door for privacy). Separate 'Spa' Shower and WC area, also Bath Tub was located near window too.Breakfast:The breakfast room located at the ground was classy. The menu was delightful with plenty of choices. From American Breakfast of Fried Eggs, Sussages and Bacon to China Porridge to Rice Dishes to Japanese Roll to Dessert Tarts. Freshly brewed coffee was served every morning. Facilities:Excellent and large gym with excellent weights and aerobic equipment. But best of all was the 25m lap pool!Service staff:From counter staff, kitchen staff, waiting staff, front desk, bell-boys and Concerige. Excellent, Courteous and Attentive. Location:Nothing interesting nearby but there was a shopping mall within a short 5 mins walk World Trade Center was 10 mins walk and the famour Silk Plaza was around 15 mins walk. The Local Underground Transit Stop was located just outside the hotel but I did not use. Note that this hotel is just open and very new and I can detect a slight 'smell' in the hallways and pool, not so evident in the room (probably still need some airing). Nothing too offensive but definitely there. Also not all taxt will know this hotel, so do a print a copy of the Map. Mar 7 2021 	This hotel actually stinks	This supposedly 5 star hotel actually &quot;stinks&quot;. That is, there's something defective with its sewage pipes within ALL its room's washroom which makes close proximity to its toilets unbearable. On top of this, the rooms are so HOT in the winter time since there's no way of turning down the thermostat without turning off the rooms ventilation system and the windows can't be opened. And there's no air conditioning in the rooms during winter time. Which is common in Beijing hotels... I've stayed in many Beijing hotels for the past 3 years. I've actually stayed here back in Nov 2008 with the same problems but in a different room, floor and wing. At that time, I thought it was an isolated case. But, with my this current stay, the identical problems exists. I've complained on both occasions and both time, they've just sprayed freshener in the drainage and fiddled with the ventilation.. problem still persists. On top, this hotel is so new that most taxis won't know where it is so you'll have to give them specific directions.. even when I can speak Mandarin, its adds complexity on your trip. And finally, the service is pretty bad for a 5 star hotel. Had to change hotel because of the aforementioned problems in the middle of the night at 11pm and there was no doorman or bell boy in the front entrance. To add to the problem, there are very few taxis waiting in front.. mostly because few people know about this hotel.On the plus side, the hotel is new and all the rooms are nicely decorated. The hotel lobby is very grand. The breakfast buffet has a wide selection. And the price is pretty reasonable given its location and decoration. But, the smell of the washroom is a closer for me. Feb 12 2021 	Horrible service of this hotel!	Since i found this hotel from the website,and this hotel featured a lot of satisfaction i expect such as the view of the CCTV head-quarter and Mandarin Oriental hotel at the next, huge bathroom with larger bathtub.great location to access CBD which would suprise us for an enjoyable stay.But after then,we were completely disappointed not to be served by whole hotel staffs from concierge , housekeeping ,reception , bellboy or as well..here are our horrible experiences of staying this hotel from following lists:1: Once we got arrived to the hotel..the bellboy were not that friendly for our arrival ,no more smiles and sincere welcome at all.2: When we checked in to reception and required the staff to have the room which's located at the high floor and can see the view with CCTV tower and Mandarin oriental from hotel room..But the staff didn't seem understand what that meant which meant she's failed to understand what exactly required in english..and the staff have no much personality of his service attitude..no smile no warmth no team work spirit at all.3.After we checked in,and started putting the room key to activate the lift,the room key failed to activate the lift from time to time...it bothered us a lot until we came back to the reception to replace the new key.4:After we left from the elevator and walked on the way for our room...OMG..most of the decorations to the wall..floor and the ceiling was extremely boring which didn't make sense the decoration from lobby..biz centre..outside the hotel entrance.so far the carpet looked so uncomfortable that were not made by the quality material,and the room door didn't look like a hard wood which serves as a high prevention of fire hazard and sound proof,we can imagine that if there was a fire that we might get cooked.5.As the 5 stars accommondation which provides the presentable services for every guests,i was so disppointed not to be satisfied by the housekeeper,since we left out the room for sightseeing and called the housekeeping to send somebody to get out room cleaned and refreshed...once we came back to the room..omg ,the housekeeping didn't make the job done which meant they had gotten the room cleaned,but the bed seemed not be to done,they put the back pillows beside the king's size bed and didn't make it nice as well as since we came to the room,that's our the worst treatment that we ever experienced with.5,Before we checked out,i have enquired the concierge staff to show us the list which the terminal of the beijing internation airport we should be in..but they had no idea about the infortmation of the airlines where the planes land to,just gave us the airlines list without explaining the details on our inquiry.Finally,i think this hotel is absolutely not recommendbale for you to stay with for biz or leisure purposes,that's shame for the both managers managing this hotel for every customers....5-stars luxury hotel..haha ,what a shame,what a fiasco.That's all my comment of staying there.thanks for stopping by. Jan 30 2021 	New home in Beijing	Frequent visitor to Beijing ( six trips in 5 months), and I've now found my preferred hotel. Rooms are very good size, excellent bathrooms and the bed with selection of pillows is extremely comfortable. Most all the staff have good or very good English. Of particular note is the dining / breakfast room. I had perhaps one of the best simple fish/vegetables dishes ever. The Chinese food is also very good. Pool and gym facilities are first class and I even tried a basic massage in the spa - very good if a little pricey. Next return trip is February and I have no need to look anywhere else. Jan 1 2021 	A Truly Grand Hotel	This being our first time in Beijing, we had anticipated walking quite a bit touring the attractions and decided that it would be nice to come back to a nice comfortable hotel after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. On a tip from our travel agent we chose this hotel. The hotel is located in the Central Business District and about a 25 minute taxi ride from the airport. We stayed 4 days and 3 nights at this hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The decor of the lobby was modern and classy, and the staff were very helpful and accommodating right from the start. The rooms are well decorated with a flat screen tv, free internet connection, and a huge bathroom. The tub was large and ideal for soaking in a bubble bath at the end of the day. The separate shower had good space and dual shower heads. Also, the room was well stocked with some bathroom toiletries. Everything about the room was quite new and there were no signs of wear and tear at all. There was even a complimentary shoe polish service. Perhaps the one thing I would suggest would be for the hotel to get firmer mattresses for the beds and firmer pillows as well. The breakfast buffet was quite good compared to other hotel buffets that we have had with a good mixture of Asian and Western breakfast food. Perhaps because we were there in December but the breakfast dining room was never full. In fact there was one time when our party were the only guests dining in the room. The hotel is a business hotel however, we saw several families with young children there and it seems that the hotel caters well to a diverse clientèle. The exercise room is big with a juice bar, and several exercise machines. One thing that we regret was that the swimming pool was not opened due to construction. The pool's size was tremendous and it had to be one of the biggest indoor pools that I have seen in a hotel. We would certainly stay at this hotel again in future trips to Beijing if not only to be able to swim in the pool! Besides that, it boasts a good location where you can get practically anywhere by taxi or subway, and is in an area that is less touristy than other areas. Nov 18 2008 	Nice place to stay	This hotel locates outside the inner city (inner city is where the Forbidden Palace is located.), around the second ring road. However, there is a subway near by that you can take and is faster than using taxi because of heavy traffic in Beijing. But beware of high volume of bodies using the subway. There are about 16 million people living in Beijing, therefore, it can be tiring trying to fight and push your way through the train door. Since the hotel is quite new, I can smell the new paint and at times make me feel sick. The room itself is modern and very nice. Flat TV screen, free internet connection, nice bed and pillows, coffee/tea/Chinese tea are plus addition. The shower is fantastic with two shower heads jetting nice warm water. The staff is friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast and lunch are very good with varieties of Asian and Western choices. The hotel has a nice gym and a nice-looking swimming pool. Unfortunately, the pool was not ready to use during my visit.This is a nice place to stay and I can find silence and peace after wondering through a mass of people during my sight-seeing. Nov 17 2008 	Preposterous services overall	We held a corporate event at this hotel early Nov 2008 and received preposterous services overall. 99% of the Staffs at the hotel were unable to communicate in English, they were unfriendly and unwilling to provide assistance to guests. I will not recommend anyone to use this hotel for both business and leisure purposes. Nov 13 2008	A great experience	This is a new hotel only having opened just prior to the Olympics.The staff were fabulous, polite and very willing to help and accommodate your requests.It is located within a 1 minute walk from the subway station which is part of the new line for the Olympics. The subway enables you to travel around Beijing relatively easily and cheaply.The rooms are modern, comfortable and clean.The executive lounge is pleasant and staffed by a great team of people.The hotel has a good gym and a huge indoor swimming pool. The restaurants are good, although sometimes on occasions some of the buffet food was a little dry, but the variety is good.The bar has a jazz band which can be a little noisy and overwhelming in the evenings, but is still worth a visit.Overall this is an extremely good hotel and one worth staying at as a base for a trip to and around Beijing. Aug 26 2008 	A TRUE Grand Hotel	We booked last minute to come to the Olympic, never knew or heard of this Hotel before. What a positive surprise, from the time you step into this true Grand Hotel till you leave. Everyone is sooooo friendly there, the ground floor lobby is where all the action is, a super lounge with very attentive service and a Chinese culture band… not the cheese once one would expect no really nice a pleasant to listen to. There is a Chinese restaurant with super nice food and a large designer breakfast restaurant. The bar is a little wrong and we in our group thought this should be better a sports bar or jazz..Our room was very spacious and also very modern, the location is central with a subway station 2 minutes walk, right in front of the HotelWell we want to come back next year to Beijing to do some more touristy things and definitely will stay in this Hotel again."
"Apr 3 2021	Terrible hotel terrible staff	Stayed at Grand View Garden Hotel end of March with family. At first the hotel appeared to be clean but on inspection bathrooms were not cleansed properly, hair was evident from the previous customer. Breakfast was a lovely if you were allowed in breakfast area. With the excuse of a full breakfast area ( even though room would not be half filled). Every morning the hotel staff would send asian origin customers to an alternate breakfast area at the back of the hotel where it was cold, little choice of food and lack of staff and no cuttery avaliable. Western customers were allowed to enter the main breakfast area even though I was told prior to them that the room was full. When asked for an explanation, the hotel staff (Jenny) ignored me and pretended that she did not understand, waving her hand to gesture me to leave. Overall very dissappointed with this hotel and never stay there again. Nov 2 2018	A reasonable hotel	You might end up staying here if you book the 3 star tour with Wendy wu, The hotel does all the important stuff well - rooms are clean and food okay. It could be better with a little more attention to detail - the bathrooms are a little tatty and i spotted the odd loose telephone wire. I agree the Internet cost is high. I though that the business services secretary would have a better command of English than the chinese average but this did not prove to be the case - i am not sure how she would have coped with typing up a letter or two. Oct 29 2018	Average accommodation overpriced extras	Stayed 3 nights with a tour group. Was tour group standard. Rooms OK, Breakfast OK. Even though inside city moat, too far from anywhere.Ridiculously high prices in Hotel Bar (ie bottle of beer in bar was 15times local store price and 4 times local restaurant price)Also they wanted 1.8yuan PER MINUTE of internet access. Found local internet bar for 3yuan per hour. Sep 22 2018 	Paralympic Visit 2018	The hotel was everything we expected and more. I stayed at the hotel with my son for 10 days, supporting Hazel Simpson, paralympic athlete. One minor problem with the bathroom (small overnight flood), but this was dealt with immediately with no inconvenience to ourselves. Food (breakfast only for us) was everything we expected. Staff were always helpful and curtious. Barstaff always beautifully uniformed and professional. Soft furnishings in public areas were in good condition. Carpets appeared new throughout the hotel. General hotel cleanliness was excellent. Housekeeping and room cleaning was 100%. Room security - I accidently forgot to lock the Safe one day in a rush to get to The Birds Nest Stadium, - management reset and locked the Safe, and the room-maid &quot;camped out&quot; outside the room to tell us when we returned, - you could't have asked for more. Aug 26 2018 	grand view garden hotel Beijing	Stayed in this hotel with my husband and 2 children as the start of our china holiday tour,we had previously spent 3 nights in the holiday inn central. The Grand view was not a very nice place to stay not only was the carpet stained all over the hotel it was also very run down. The hotel room was dirty the bathroom had mold growing in the sealant and black hair on the shower wall, the mini bar was empty even though we had paid a deposit for it and it took 2 days for them to fill it ! We had booked an interconnecting room but instead we had rooms down the corridor from each other and they would not change them and could not speak english when we tried to sort it out. The hotel boasts a bowling alley but that was dismantled years ago and the night club is more like private rooms for karaoke ! The food at the hotel was average even the chinese food was average let alone the american. When we left we had bites around our ankles ( not very nice)Overall i would not stay here again, i would stay at the holiday inn central Beijing which was wonderful Dec 12 2017	A pleasant hotel but remote from main sites	Stayed in this hotel as part of a Wendy Wu tour. It was a very pleasant low rise hotel. The rooms were warm, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a bit worn and the shower rather feeble. Breakfast was very good as long as you got there fairly early. The hotel is a long way out from the city centre and not near a subway either. However, taxis are cheap. There is a supermarket nearby (out of hotel turn right and then turn left at the KFC and it is on the left.)There is a nice park next to the hotel with free entry for hotel residents.Internet is very expensive at the business centre 1.8 yuan a minute, but if you go down to the gym in the basement you can use the internet for free (it is slow though) and get a free gift too!!If like us you finish up your tour here and are flying home with BA, you can check in on-line and book your seats, you just can't print your boarding pass. This does'nt matter as they check you in at the airport. Oct 5 2017	Nice Hotel	A lovely hotel, very comfortable rooms - ours had an outlook of the courtyard and others in our group looked out into the gardens. Beds were the most comfortable of the trip. Breakfasts were very busy and staff were not able to keep up with the needs of the customers, the coffee machine broke down every day and we always had to go in search of cutlery and napkins. Food served was nice though and the 'egg chef' cooked a mean omlette. We were able to check in early which was a nice touch having just gotten off the train from Xi'an (11 hours) and able to freshen up and eat breakfast. Check out was a nightmare, very disorganised. Our tour guide received a phone call advising of all sorts of issues after check out such as missing keys and unpaid bills - everyone had paid and returned their keys the hotel just had no idea what was going on. Plus, the most disappointing thing was that there was no complimentary bottled water (as promised by the tour guide/operator) - we had to pay 8 yuan a bottle (special price). This was the only hotel on the tour where this occurred and it was supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Sep 12 2017	good hotel bad location	stayed here for 3 nights as part of our kuoni tour - gorges of the yangtze.we were met at the airport by our tour manager Hong (who was excellent) and transfered to the hotel within 90 mins.this hotel is in the middle of nowhere so if you are not on an escorted tour i would stay away as there are no attractions within walking distance.the rooms were of a good size and clean . the buffet breakfast and restaurants were very good although the bar let the place down.only 2 draught beers and the decor was dull and outdated.our excursions included tiananmen square,the forbidden city,great wall(mutianyu section),summer palace and the temple of heaven.we arrived at the wall at 10.00 and had 2 hours to ourselves. it was very hot but not overcrowded.i would not advise arriving at midday with babies as some people did. the cablecar saved the legs and time.the walk around tiananmen square was very thought provoking.there are a few buildings closed in the forbidden city (including the palace of supreme harmony) but as there are so many others this did not detract from the visit.the kung fu show at the red theatre is worth a look. the hotel staff were polite and helpful. overall an enjoyable stay in beijing. Aug 19 2017 	Perfectly adequate.	We stayed here as part of our Kuoni tour, China Highlights. Perfectly adequate hotel with a good breakfast. The breakfast rooms tend to be busy as everyone wants to leave at the same time but it's not a problem.The swimming pool is around the back and changing rooms are in desperate need of renovation but apart from that no complaints.Garden at the back is well worth a visit after breakfast.It is some distance from the attractions so if you are not on a tour this might be a problem for you but it was fine for us. Jun 23 2017 	Not bad	Clean, tidy hotel but stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Some 'gardens' out the back of the hotel (reached through the hotel, follow the signs), entrance for the public is up the road and they have to pay. A few drinking establishments located outside by the more adventurous in our group and also a couple of restaurants, not much else.Standard rooms adequate, miniscule bathroom with thin towels which did not get you dry but well enough equipped. We opened our curtains to find the biggest satellite dish in the Guiness Book of Records! Ghastly, no wonder the curtains were closed when we arrived in the middle of the day. Buffet breakfast was fine, taken in 1 of 2 rooms. A staff member will indicate which one you should use with a grunt and a toss of her head. Didn't eat anything else there so no idea of standard. Waitresses looked bored and tired though not impolite particularly, didn't take much notice of the customers just cleared the tables. Find own table, bit of a scrum and you share with anyone/everyone else. Take something to leave on the chair when you've bagged your seat or someone else will sit there while you're getting your brekky!On an organised tour so trips out were arranged already, if DiY I wouldn't stay here - uninteresting outside and location pretty much rubbish. All in all a fairly mediocre hotel, neither good nor bad, doesn't really stand in any area really. Jun 10 2017	Adequate Accommodation	We stayed at Grand View Garden Hotel in Beijing as part of our 14 days group tour of China in May from Alberta, Canada. We stayed on the 2nd floor and the renovated hotel rooms had met our travel expectations: clean room, clean bathroom, hot shower, and working air conditioning. The rooms were small and the lighting was dim. Hotel staff did not have good command of spoken English, but it did not create a big problem for us. ATM machine was available in the hotel lobby.The quality of the Western and Chinese buffet breakfast was average. Grand View Garden is a Chinese style hotel located in a typical Beijing neighbourhood on Nan Cai Yuan Street. There are shops and restaurants along the street. I don't believe there are any hotels in Beijing, a city of 16 millions people, that is within walking distance to tourist attractions. Traffic conjestion is a daily reality in any major Chinese city including Beijing. Taxi fare is cheap; the most we paid for a taxi ride in China was 26 RMB, which was less than $4.00 Canadian. Behind the hotel is the famous Chinese garden, Daguanyuan, based on the Chinese classic &quot;The Dream of the Red Mansion,&quot; and entrance fee for hotel guests is free. It was very relaxing to visit the garden in the morning watching groups of local Chinese doing their tai chi and exercise routine. This hotel is pretty good value for someone who wants to be a traveller in China. If you want to be a typical Western tourist, look for an American style hotel in Beijing. May 13 2017 	Good Hotel	Must have stayed in a different hotel from the last review. We were here as part of a Kuoni tour and we were delighted with this hotel. Our room had recently been refurbished and was lovely with even a drinking water tap. Very clean and comfortable and a good size The garden was fantastic - really peaceful when you think you are in the middle of Beijing. The breakfast was excellent with a bril choice of either western of chinese food Apr 28 2017 	Don't go there...	Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 4 days in the start of April, 2017. The hotel is nice-looking, but have some major flaws. First, the hotel is situated a long way from the - ANY attractions, and so therefore you will have to grab a cab, which is no problem. But in a city like Beijing with heavy traffic problems during rush hour, it will take you a long time to get just a few km away from Grand View Garden Hotel. Don't go here if you just NEED to have an english or western-like breakfast - the one at the hotel is absolutely terrible! And VERY, VERY expensive! I believe we payed 135 RMB for the two of us for 1 meal...! The food was cold, and probably not made today - only a few hundred metres north of the hotel is a little 'shop', selling some kind of pancake (chinese fastfood) out the window, which is very good. 2 RMB... Furthermore, we weren't lucky with our room, which had a GRAND view to a giant satellite dish - and the tone in the windows made the room where dark, I guess we would just have loved to wake up with the sun in our eyes. On the other hand, the bathroom was fine, fine and there was always hot water available for making your own tea.At last, the receptionists were indeed not very good at their job; not very helpful, not very good at english or worldwide finger alphabet, and, some of them, rather arrogant. We never got to try the hotels swimmingpool. Our advice: Do not choose this hotel if you're in Beijing on a tourists holiday, but it might be okay if you're there on business - still you will have to order breakfast from outside, though... Apr 15 2017 	Would not stay again	I was not impressed. A big difference from the BP International in Hong Kong. Front desk female was combative and rude to our travel agent; very few of the employees seemed happy to work there. Saw a couple of employee arguments during our stay.We arrived with 3 rooms, 2 of which smelled of smoke and mildew. We asked to be moved; got a promise that they would fix the smell, and sent a guy to spray the Chinese version of glade air freshener.We asked to have at least two of the rooms close together (for our kids to stay), and were told that they could not do this. So, our rooms were 1208, 1223, and 1265. Thanks.The meals were not good. There's a few different resturants; but they open up at least 2 for breakfast. I found the meals to be poor - the danishes were at least 2 days old; very stale. Juice despensers were leaky...all of it was unappetizing.We ate dinner once...and that was enough. For $20 bucks a head, we were treated to a buffet that included flat warm beer, cold egg drop soup, and other un-appetizing dishes. All while the help scowled at us and informed us that they were going to close so we'd better hurry up.They do have a shop with a tailor and some food and trinkets. We never tried the pool based on the condition of the resturant and rooms - my guess is that it wasn't very clean but we didn't have the time to find out. The one helpful person was the female night manager - helped us out with shopping locations.All in all, a poor location (takes about 30 minutes more to get anywhere since its south of the city), unclean hotel with unhappy staff. We would have moved out but our schedule was too busy to deal with the hassel. Feb 14 2017	No Complaints	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nighs hotel as part of a tour. We were happy with this hotel. The rooms were clean and the staff were friendly. And the garden was very relaxing which is hard to do in Beijing. The hotel has a definite Chinese feel so if you are looking for Hilton or Sheraton, keep looking. Nov 12 2006	Not a delux but a comfortable hotel	The hotel is not a surprise to us after reading all the reviews. We found it clean although there is a type of odor in the bathroom which we found not very pleasant. As one poster says, the room has a minimum of bedding/sheets; we found it a bit too hot with only the duvet available as blanket. The shower in the bathroom is comletely pathetic - with water just triggled down! Another thing that pissed us off is - our room was in the non-smoking floor (since we specifically asked for it), and yet a neighboring room had a guest smoking openly with his door wide open - so that the stinky smoke spilled all into the hallway. we figured we would not have got any results if we did complain, so we did not.What we found quite unique is the garden and the classical story behind it. It would have been much beautiful had we been there say, a month earlier. We were surprised to find that the Grand View garden is also rated as one of the top 40 tourist site in China. We do not mind going back (since the price is right) - except that we would check the shower first before accepting the room. Nov 6 2006	Affordable Luxury	The hotel is located south-west of the Forbidden Palace and on the 3rd inner ring road. Locatioins to most tourist attractions are within 10-30 minutes away by mini-buses (private).The facilities and staff friendliness is a very welcoming experience. Cleanliness is above average. Although the staffs don't speak fluent English (we know they are trying very hard), their warmth and smily faces is enough to tell what they're trying to say, although not all the time when you need a translator.I would go back to this place again in near future. I have not regretted living here as it has offered me a memorable experience. Oct 19 2006 	A lot more than an acceptable hotel	We stayed here on a tour for 3 nights. The first impression is good of the Chinese architecture style that the hotel has been built in. Once inside the lobby is impressive, with a large marble staircase up to function rooms, a piano which is played in the evening and another seating area. The check in was efficient, with two sections to check in and a separate area to change money with the exchange rates posted on the wall, we didn't change money here but they were happy to change a 100Y note to smaller notes. There are seats to relax in the lobby, which also has a shop selling Olympic merchandise, which leads through to more shops, selling arts and crafts and a convenience shop with food and drink.Off the lobby is a bar, further down the corridor are 3 restaurants, 1 Western, which was very good, unless a tour party had arrived it was never busy, only a handful of people, even if there was a tour in, it didn't bother the a la carte diners, most dishes seemed to be between 30-100 Yuan. The next restaurant was advertising Abalone and Sharks Fin soup, it seemed to be incredible expensive, but I may have misunderstood. The last restaurant I think was BBQ style with an area in the centre of the restaurant where the food was being cooked.Breakfast was the best we had in China, a good selection of cereals, milk, yoghurt, 4 fruit juices, breads, lovely small danish pastries, plenty of cooked items, bacon, sausage etc, there was a chef cooking eggs fresh each morning, obviously there was also chinese breakfast items. There are 3 rooms for breakfast, which double as the reataurants, these can get busy when everyone is trying to get out for the same time.The room was a good size, we had a twin with 2 double beds, which we comfortable, not hard like most chinese beds, nice linens on the beds, 2 easy chairs, table, TV with english language news channel, and a writing area. The bathroom was fine with a good selection of soaps etc. There was an in room safe, kettle and tea. The mini bar was empty, but was cold so you could keep your water cool, when we checked in we were asked if we wanted the minibar filled.The pool is accessed throught the BBQ style restaurant? I know strange, the pool its self was fine,a decent size, the water was cold, which seems to be the norm for China. Sadly the changing area was shocking, tiny, lockers broken, floor soaking wet, unbelievable really, also you will need a swimming cap which are on sale for 30Yuan, a bit steep as everything else in the country is cheap!The hotel is South West from the center of Beijing, it is not near the underground, we never had a problem hailing a taxi from outside of the hotel, it was less than 20Yuan to Tiananmen Sq and 28Yuan to the Back Sea Bar area. The hotel isn't exactly central, but wherever you stay you will no doubt need to take a taxi somewhere. Sorry didn't take any pictures of the rooms, kept meaning to take them when the room was tidy! and slept in on the last morning Aug 23 2006 	A clean hotel with a good range of facilities	After reading some of the reviews of this hotel I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Our room was clean, comfortable and well-provided with the expected facilities. Breakfast was good with a wide choice of foods for every taste. Staff were helpful and polite. There is a large park at the rear which was pleasant to walk around in the late afternoon or early morning. Jun 25 2006	Not too bad	Stayed here for 3 nights while taking an organized tour in China. Not a hotel I would choose myself.It probably was a luxery hotel in the 80's but it is now behind on renovation. Although everything you expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel is here, it is looking a bit old and outdated.Minibar was completely empty and after asking it was filled. The room was very difficult to find. The hotel looks like a big mase.Breakfast was horrible. Alhough it states that they serve continental and American breakfast, this is not something I would pay for myself.The staff in the hotel bar was not nice and not like seen in other places in China. Drinks were overpriced for Chinese hotel average.Breakfast bread tastes like it has no salt, orange juice is water with a flavour, you need to find your croissant with a magnifying glass, and the breakfast area is not big enough to accommodate that many tourists that need to eat their breakfast at the same time.Their are some chinese restaurants, a KFC, a big chinese supermarket and a pharmacy in the neighbourhood. But apart from that this is a boring place. None of Beiings tourist locations are nearby. So unless you like a boring place or are only here to sleep, skip this hotel. Jun 5 2006	Boring and a bit worn	This hotel is situated in the south western part of Beijing; far from everything. Contrary to many other hotels in China, this hotel has been built with very few floors, but very many rooms on each floor. It can be a bit hard to memorize the route to and from your room the first night or two.The room I had (2157) was large, but looked a bit &quot;worn&quot; - especially in the bathroom. Although the bath was clean and tidy, there was the odd brown spots here and there. The room was quiet. Very little outside noise from other guests.The hotel service was good and efficient, and the breakfast restaurant had a great selection of various kinds of food and drink, that should cater for most tastes. Even cold milk was available.The bar and the small hotel shop catered for most needs, when in the hotel. The hotel has ATM for Visa and MasterCard and others. Lobby is large. Internet was not tested. As in most chinese hotels, you can use both european and australasia connectors for 220V 50 Hz.Even if you're not looking for &quot;nightly excitement&quot;, the hotel is boring. Good quality boredom, alas...If you're looking for a hotel room only needed for sleeping, this is as good as any. Otherwise pick something else. Here you're not even taking a nightly stroll outside. There's &quot;nothing&quot; in the neighbourhood. May 4 2006	Not Impressed!	When i arrived and went to my room i was horrified! The smell of the room was horrible, we had the kitchens right below us, all of the furniture in the room i.e. the tables and chairs were on top of the bed, there was chewing gum stuck on the bathroom side, the window was so dirty you could hardly see out of it, and the view that i had was a huge satelite dish that covered the whole window, not so grand! I went straight down to reception and asked to be moved, and we were within an hour, the next room was ok, smelt a lot fresher and was overall a lot nicer. The breakfast was ok, apart from if you go down at a busy time you have to sit on a large round table and share with other people, didn't like that so much, and this hotel is every much out of the way, i felt like i was the only english person in beijing when i went for a walk down the road to the supermarket. Would rush back in a hurry! Apr 8 2006 	Ok except for the location	I spent 5 weeks at this hotel. While the room rate is more than acceptable at less than RMB 400 its location leaves much to be desired. You will have to take a taxi to go anywhere. And there is very little of interest in the nearby streets. There are more local people than foreign tourists staying at this hotel. The foreigners are mostly people travelling in groups.There is little as far as entertainment in the hotel except for the ubiquitous bowling alley. It was often deserted and I usually played by myself. At least the hotel was very quiet.And beware that the staff does not speak English. This hotel might not be ideal for tourists. Jan 8 2006	I would stay again	Stayed 7 days here while touring Beijing. Rooms were small, clean, and comfortable. The staff was very accomidating. Laundry was quick and cheap. The hotel has a bit of a tradional flair, which I liked. It may be a little out of the way, but I preferred that as well. Anyway, a taxi is cheap, and we spent most of our time getting around that way. The breakfast buffet was convenient but average, but at least they had good coffee. Had dinner only once in the hotel, and it was also average and relatively expensive. There are too many places to explore and eat than to eat in the hotel anyway. There was a small grungy cafe just down the street that had great food. They will throw live shrimp in your face before they cook them so be prepared. Jul 27 2005	Lovely Garden within hotel	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in June. The hotel has a choice of 3 restaurants which are expectedly more pricey but affordable than say restaurants outside. In the basements there are a disco, snooker table and bowling alley which I believe are free for staying guest. Rooms are adequate and comfortable and there is a safe in the room which is not firmly attached to the wall - so beware !!Within the hotel there is an access to garden which is amazingly beautiful but door from the hotel closes around 3pm. Non staying guests will only have access through the main gate of the garden which you have to pay entrance fee. Location of the hotel is on a side street with not much to see, apart from 1 or two restaurants. Its very old and dusty and not much to do unless you take a taxi. Hotel itself is ok but I would not recommend this hotel based on location( although the hotel is quite popular for holding special events). At the time we were there, there was a special conference for the China Olympics. Jul 13 2021 	??????????? Jul 12 2006	risque de poste restante"
"Nov 24 2021	Could be better	I agree with Kittyhead, the main interest is: It's close to Tienanmen Square &amp; the Forbidden City.My opinion about this hotel is a bit so-so, it's a good hotel, lot of services, nothing really bad but it could be more confortable and clean.People are nice, nothing to say about that. We were unlucky because first night was very noisy in the next room, but other nights were fines.Anyway, we were happy to found rooms here and it's close to shops, restaurants, etc.. Sep 4 2018 	Don't mind staying here again.	I booked the room via www.ctrip.com for CNY368, comes with complimentary internet access with no breakfast. I choose a superior business room with river view. LOCATION: 10 minutes walk from Beijing Pedestrian Road. Lots of convenience stores, restaurants, street food, massage/spa, night market, bars, pubs nearby. You have to walk a bit though. There is a 24 hours McDonalds right opposite the hotel. The building itself is also connected to a shopping complex. Sunway and taxis are easily available. ROOM: Newly renovated. It is simple yet give a modern kind of look. Toilet is clean. Towels are clean and basic amenities are provided. INTERNET: Complimentary WIFI. Connection speed is fast.Overall, it was quite a good stay. The hotel itself is an old building. With the renovated superior business room, I will stay here again for the location and complimentary WIFI. Oct 7 2017 	Filthy hotel with high prices	This hotel was filthy especially the carpets. I changed rooms 3 times trying to find a clean one but they were all equally disgusting ... Jun 28 2017 	Guangzhou - a great 4* hotel	We found this to be reasonable 4 star hotel with a great location. I did not find it nearly as run down as I have read in other reviews!Breakfast was average (mix of Chinese and Western). My Dad was thrilled that they have someone cooking your eggs as you like them in the morning.The rooms were clean and huge.We had a private tour guide for most of the trip so did not converse much with hotel staff. When we did their English was average. I understand that 3 star hotel's staff speak practically no English and that those at 5 star hotels are mostly fluent - so keep that in mind when booking your hotels!After a couple of nights in Beijing we went to Xi’an (staying at the Bell Tower, another great 4 star hotel) and on our departure from China we had an additional night in Beijing at the Novotel Xinqiao (which our guide informed us is of a nicer standard than the Novotel Peace for those tossing up the two) - and personally I would choose the Guangzhou again just because it has a great central location.I think considering we stayed here at Chinese New Year, the noise could have been a lot worse. I did think that it was very central and we were able to walk to Tianamen Square etc, and some intensive shopping is practically on your door step.I suggest you buy your own bottled water, you can do this just outside the hotel very cheaply. As someone else said, the water at this hotel is not complimentary and it is NOT safe to drink tap water.Really happy with my stay here and would go back again.. May 7 2017 	Great start to first time in Beijing	The hotel was booked as part of a package deal. We were in a double room for 3 nights. We didn't use all the hotel's facilities as we were out visiting sites most of the time. Buffet breakfasts were a great start to the days sight seeing. Not everyone spoke English but there was always someone who could - staff were very helpful.It is located in an area busy with people and shops nearby. Oct 8 2016 	not the romantic getaway we were looking for	My husband and I had been apart for 3 months and so I was very keen to have a nice relaxing hassle-free holiday, and despite asking my travel agent to find me an alternative hotel ( after reading everyone's comments on here), she insisted that this was a wonderful hotel etc etc etc, and that it would be perfect for us. Taking her word for it (foolishly!), I turned up at the hotel ahead of my husband who was coming in on a later flight. I was greeted by a very rude man at the main desk who insisted that I pay 500USD up front for the minibar. He was rude when I queried the charge, and laughed at me when I asked to speak to someone who could answer my questions.That was just the start of our problems:* I was given a basic twin room, instead of a double as i had booked.* The staff had VERY limited English and anything we ordered had to be re-ordered and hand signals used.* when my husband arrived later he was told that there was no-one boked into the hotel with my name* we were eventually given a room with a double bed (which was appreciated), but it overlooked a very busy mall-area which played loud music from 6.30am until late, had a sink that wouldn't drain and a safe that kept malfunctioning.* the room was a good size, but not cleaned adequately. It was not vacuumed once in the 7days we were there, and there was rubbish under the units and bed that were there from previous clients. There were stains on the carpet and the wallpaper was peeling.* the breakfast selection was fine, but the food was cold.There were positives though. * The hotel was centrally located and close to the subway. Only 1 stop to Tienamen square, 3 stops to Wangfujing shopping area, and about 6 stops to the Yongangli Silk Market.* several staff members were very helpful Jul 15 2016	Distinctly average	I stayed at the Guangzhou during March as part of a tour of China. First of all, anywhere you travel within China you will experience language difficulties if you don't speak Chinese! We had a tour guide and friends in Beijing who helped us out enormously with translations. Some of the reception staff at the Guangzhou did not speak much English although there were one or two staff members whose English was better, and when we had problems we had to wait for those staff to serve us so that we could make sure we were understood. The rooms were spacious, but I agree with some of the other reviews in that they are somewhat 'tired'. The carpet was stained in places and the room we were given (although a non-smoking room) smelt very strongly of cigarettes. We asked to see another room, but this room had the same cigarette odour too - so we stuck to the original room and left the window open all day which did improve things. The cleaners tried to help by spraying large amounts of scented air freshener in the room, but all this did was disguise the smell for a short time, and it did not eliminate it. The beds in hotel rooms in China are quite firm (apparently that's what the Chinese prefer), but we, as westerners, found them a bit too firm. The bathroom was pretty good and the hotel also provided dressing gowns, slippers and the usual complimentary toiletries. The breakfast selection was quite good and the porters and restaurant staff were efficient.Overall the hotel was good value. Jun 9 2016	Probably not the best hotel option in Beijing...	Obviously the #1 feature of Guangzhou Hotel is its prime location. As mentioned in the other reviews, it is close to the subway, Tianeman Square, Forbidden Palace, and all types of shopping. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom was clean but the carpet was stained and very run down (they included complimentary slippers which helped). The bed linens were also of low quality (or perhaps very old) and pilled. The rooms overall looked worn down and are in need of refurbishing.The included breakfasts are great with good quality food and a range of European/American/Chinese brekafast options.Now for the &quot;not so good&quot; things. This was the only hotel we stayed at in China (we stayed at 3 in total) that did not provide complimentary bottled water. We asked the staff if we could drink the water from the tap but since they spoke very little or no english they couldn't understand what we were asking. We ended up going to a grocery store and buying bottled water for ourselves. This hotel was also the most difficult to get internet access. There was (expensive 15 RMB for first 10 minutes and 0.5 RMB for every minute after) internet in the rooms but when we tried to connect to write some emails my computer (a Mac ibook) could not connect to the server. We looked into using the internet at the business center but found that even more expensive (2 RMB/minute)! After complaining through an interpreter we managed to get the room rates for the business center access but it wasn't easy. Internet access is a big deal for me so I would find another hotel with better internet access even if the location or quality was slightly worse. The lack of english really makes like difficult in a hotel. It is hard to get them to tell your taxi driver where to go. Usually there are some tour guides in the lobby in the mornings and I would recommend asking one of them to act as an interpreter if you are having difficulty.Overall I think Guangzhou is in need of a renovation and modernization. The location is nice but for the prices I see listed on other websites I think a better option could be found. Mar 2 2016	Decent Hotel	The hotel was well maintained. It is very near to the subway. The staff was very courteous, but nobody could speak English. Jan 9 2016	Nice hotel in Beijing	The Guangzhou is a great place to stay. It's convenient; it's a 15-20 minute walk to Tienanmen Square &amp; the Forbidden City and along the Xidan shopping area.The hotel is also very clean &amp; comfortable with great breakfasts. Highly recommended. Nov 8 2005	Good choice	My family and I stayed at the Guangzhou in October 2005. It lived up to its 4 star rating. It was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful. We would stay there again. Jan 8 2021 	?????"
"Sep 18 2017 	The best and the worst	A charming traditional courtyard hotel in a central location. The dark side is getting the choice of room right. The smaller rooms are relatively cheap - about 600RMB, but they are not for the faint hearted: smelly drains, basic shower onto the floor in the bathroom, window open and insecure or locked shut - no security grill, plaster dropping from the walls, little storage space (no wardrobe). We started with 3 beds in the room, but there was literally no room to walk! One of the staff has basic English, but if she is not on shift, it's sign language.After unpacking, and discovering the room's hidden problems, we asked to move another room. We were shown a delightful courtyard suite at a much higher rate - 1200RMB. We were told we could move the next day which we did, but we are pretty sure it was vacant at the time. So - all the preliminaries were rather unpleasant.Having got to the courtyard suite, we were extremely happy, as this was very well equipped, two large bedrooms, large sitting room, all with airconditioning and TV, a nice bathroom, and a water cooler. Outside each of 3 suites look onto a lovely courtyard with a delightful water feature. You feel as if you are staying as you might have hundreds of years ago, and you are so deep in the Hutong, there is almost no noise, and you are still close to many attractions. Overall a great place to stay.For others intending to come here, check the room before you pay, and before you move in so you can jump to plan B, if your first choice isn't what you want for the price.It seems little has changed from other reviewers a year ago. Apr 24 2017 	Basic with Great Location	Originally I tried to book at the Bamboo Garden Hotel, based on the great reviews in Trip Advisor, but it was full so the extremely helpful woman, Wendy, at the Bamboo Garden made a reservation for me at Hebei Hotel. Before arriving Wendy &amp; the people at Hebei were very helpful in assisting me to book a car/driver &amp; guide and a car from the airport. They were not very expensive &amp; I would suggest doing this as the hotel is not that easy to find.This is what they call a Courtyard Hotel &amp; is down a Hutong (narrow lane in a local neighborhood). When we turned off the main road into the Hutong, I got very nervous as this was more local than I had imagined. But when we pulled into the driveway we were pleasantly surprised. This is definitely NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel, it is basic and functional and in a great location. The desk staff speaks limited English, but were extremely helpful and freindly. The room (standard size) was small for 3 of us with the extra bed, but we didn't spend much time there so it didn't matter. The room could use a coat of paint &amp; the shower has no walls, it's just part of the bathroom. I would ask for a room away from the parking area and front desk, 2nd floor would be ideal. Being in a neighborhood you do not get traffic noise or construction noise (both things I'd been warned about in Beijing). We looked into one of the larger rooms (a suite I think) &amp; it was very nice &amp; huge and more recently renovated, so if you might want to upgrade to a better room.The streets around the hotel are narrow and local. It is an easy walk to the main street which is not a far walk from Jing Shan Park, Bei Hai Park or Hou Hai (lots of bars &amp; restaurants). It actually would not be too far to the back entrance of the Forbidden City. If you take a taxi, have them drop you off on the main street &amp; walk the Hutong into the hotel, as we got caught in traffic along the Hutong that held us up probably 20 minutes. The people along the Hutong are extremely friendly and helpful. We found all of Beijing to be this way.There is breakfast, but it is Chinese, although you can get eggs &amp; the oatmeal is made with coconut milk &amp; very thin. I would suggest getting a guide &amp; car to visit the Great Wall &amp; actually we ended up using one the entire 3 days we were there. It is not that expensive &amp; definitely helps you maximize your time. Traffic in Beijing is terrible &amp; the hotel is not near an underground station. Again, this is a basic hotel in a great location. You will get the feel of old Beijing &amp; how the local people live. It was charming, but simple. We enjoyed our stay very much. Oct 16 2016 	Great location neglected hotel	Just came back for a 3 day stay in the Hebei Guest House.The location is indeed very good! Tucked away in an old Hutong (old part with small meandering alleyways) and difficult to find, the surroundings are definetly charming and much more authentic than in any other 5 star chain hotel. Within walking distance you find the Forbidden City, TianAnMen Square, WangFuJin and the Houhai Bar area.The hotel has three buildings. The rooms in the two newer buildings have virtually no old charme and go for around 350 RMB and 650 RMB. In the back of the newer buildings are two lovely courtyards and several suite type of rooms are opening up to it. These rooms are significatly more expensive, the rack rate is about 1200 RMB and 2100 RMB, but I reckon there is some room for negotiations.We were a group of 5, and booked a triple and a double. When I made the reservation I was recomended to take the 650 RMB room, since it would be more spacious and sufficient and convenient for the triple. However when we were shown to our rooms, they were very small and in the triple a very uncomfortable cot had been squeezed between two single beds. After that unfortunately no space was left for 3 people to stand in the room not to mention to put the bags somewhere.About one meter in front of the windows was a several meters high concrete wall, so the rooms were very dark, disgustingly smelly and the plaster came down the walls. The room was dusty and grim, black undefinable stuff was stuck on the floor under the sink in the bathroom and the toilet was broken. When I asked to see another room they showed me some sort of suite with a bed with a golden/ light green headpiece which had a big grey stain where obviously people usually lay their head...The hotel could be very nice with it's location and old buildings, but it is not only overpriced but unfortunatley totaly neglected and has just not the right value for this kind of money. I had the impression the owner sees the opportunity to make a fast buck with all the tourists wanting to stay in an old fashioned Courtyard Hotel. The rooms urgently need to be cleaned properly, a facelift and some renovation. Broken things were just not fixed or only very provisonal and amateurish.The place does have a lot potential, a shame that it hasn't the right owner who appreciates it. Sep 16 2016 	Comfortable clean and great location	We booked two rooms for our party of 5. We wanted reasonably priced lodging that would give us an Asian feel, rather than a Western feel. We also wanted a location within walking distance of the Forbidden City and Tien. Square. The Hebei Guest House was clean and comfortable. The staff were polite and helpful. Although they spoke some English we had a fluent Chinese speaker in our party and so did not do any communicating in English. They are happy to arrange airport or other transportation for you, but the price is much higher than if you made your own arrangements with one of the abundant cab drivers on the street. The guest house is in a traditional hutung neighborhood which is enjoyable to walk through on the way back after a busy, noisy day in the city. I would stay there again and recommend it highly."
"Oct 14 2021 	I love the hotel	Now I'm living in this hotel nearly three weeks . I feel it is a good place if your take your leisure trip. It provides good service , delicious food, nice toom, especially the convenient traffic. If you are a tourist, there are many traffic tools you can choose to get to your destination. At last, I have to mention that my friends Grace recommends me the hotel. The hotel make my tour much more colourful .Here, Thanks her a lot. Oct 1 2021 	Our home in Beijing	We have stayed here each April for 2 weeks for the past 3 years , as we explore BeijingAlthough it is not close to the centre of Beijing, it is on the main road and also the subway (a trip on which we feel is part of the experience). It is also well placed , being on the 4th ring road, to the summer palace , and the great wall. The rooms are large and quiet and has free internet in the rooms along with a nice breakfast buffet that caters for all nationalities. (best to try and have this included in your package). The gym and pool are well appointed and kept very clean The staff are friendly and it well priced compared to the hotels in the city centre. Jul 22 2021 	Good Hotel in western Beijing	My friend recommended me this hotel, and I booked a room in which the hotel called Executive Floor. The main feature of this floor is a study; it is decorated with much age-old china and books to tell us what Chinese culture is look like; I love it. Generally speaking, the room is nice and the service is professional. The restaurant is pretty good, especially the buffet. It provided various delicious dishes and the price is affordable. What’s more, traffic is convenient. The hotel is nearby subway, and it’s easy to call taxi, and what I think the most convenient thing is the location. It is in the old residential district and there are many other restaurants and shops around it, so maybe you can find your flavor here and buy some articles for daily use, even kill time.I lived here just few days, but it is easy to be familiar with their staff. In this hotel, you will not feel like a foreigner or even a stranger, everyone here is friendly. According to my experience in Beijing, the hotel is your best choice if you stay in the Western Beijing. Dec 20 2018 	Best service in any hotel	This hotel is on the west side of Beijing. It is a little far from Downtown areas but a quick subway or $7 US taxi ride away. I have to say that the service in this hotel is the best I received anywhere. From the restaurant to the executive lounge to everything in the hotel they make you feel like a king. When you call for something a quick response is usually had in less than 2 minutes. This level of service could not be had in the US for almost any price. Plus, all the workers in this hotel are very professional and go above and beyond for guest.The rooms in this hotel are very nice. I would recommend paying for the executive floors. The rooms on the executive floor would be comparable to a 5 star hotel in the US. I do not think you could get a room this nice for $400 a night in New York. Plus, a buffet breakfast is included. Western and chinese food are offered and it is incredible the choices they have. Plus, the executive rooms allow 4 peices of laundry to be cleaned free of charge per day, and 6 soft drinks from the wet bar free of charge. You will have access to an amazing executive loung that offers free food at night and drinks. I was upgraded to the executive floor because of my platinum status. The regular rooms are nice, but a little old and not in comparison to the executive rooms.The main restaurant offers a nightly buffet for 128 RMB about $20 US. It is very elaborate and has Italian food and chinese food. It is vey good and the dishes change nightly. It includes local draft beer and coca cola. Over the 9 days my family stayed the staff got to know us. They are very friendly and will do everything to make you feel at home. Upon check out the General Manger came to greet my family.If you find yourself in westen beijing or do not mind a 20 minute ride to the center of the city stay here. It is half the price of the downtown hotels. remember to stay in an executive room and the extra 150 RMB $23 US or so a day is worth it. Aug 16 2018 	Buyer beware	I booked a room, later canceled it, yet charges were on my credit card statement. Holiday Inn informed me that because I booked the room online at a special rate I would not receive any refund. If you book a room here, make sure this is really where you want to stay. I switched to a different hotel because I found much better rates and accommodations though a locally owned and operated hotel. Jun 18 2018 	Ok Western hotel in China	Wanted to stay in Haidian since many of my clients are there so booked this hotel. However, it is some distance from Zhongguancun (sp) but in a typical quiet residential neighborhood. Also, some distance Forbidden City etc. although right off the main thoroughfare that leads to it. Breakfast buffet was ok. Since it is a Western hotel, didn't have problems typical of similarly rated Chinese hotels (e.g., hard bed (like sleeping on concrete), prostitution). So, if you want a Western hotel in Beijing but are willing to be a distance away from everything, it is a good hotel.The only thing that really disappointed me was the airport pick up. Had a client meeting within 2 hours of landing so wanted a quick pickup so I could drop off luggage and run to the meeting, but it took 20 minutes for the pickup to arrive. Would have been faster waiting in the taxi line (and a lot cheaper). Mar 19 2018 	Nice hotel but	I stayed here for 1 night March 15-16 for the the first American baseball games played in China. I choose this hotel because it's only a 10 minute walk from the new Olympic baseball stadium where the games were played. The new arena where the Olympic basketball games will be played is right next to the baseball stadium. The subway is also next to the baseball stadium making it also near the hotel.It's a very nice hotel with the front desk able to speak decent English. I choose a superior room for the separate shower, which also has an extra large bathroom and an electric pants press in the room. The bed is very comfortable. I booked the room on the Holiday Inn website and pre-purchaed my room and breakfast which saved me about $20. The breakfast is okay with a cooked to order omelet station. Nothing to brag about but the cost with the pre-booking was only about $8.BUT, the location is on the far west of Beijing. Sure it's near the subway. However, the subway was ALWAYS crowded whether it be afternoon or evening, Saturday or Sunday. The subway is only 26 cents one way though! A taxi from the airport took 1 hour and $18. Going back took only 45 minutes. The problem with relying with taxis is that the city traffic is so bad that it could take a while to get to this hotel from anywhere not taking the highway. I used the subways all the time except for the airport. To Tiananmen Square by subway took about 15-20 minutes. If you don't mind crowded but cheap subways, this hotel is half the cost of something more central. Jan 4 2018 	Nice hotel	Nice rooms, friendly staff. Close to the subway which is the fastest way to travel around Beijing. Go out the front, turn left go to the corner turn left again and it's just a few blocks down. Indoor pool is heated in winter so pack the swimsuit, breakfast is good but a little pricey...but it is a buffet with western food as well as Chinese and you can fill up for the day. Massage was cheap at the hotel and very good, though unlike in the US where you totally disrobe and get under a sheet they are not used to this and were a bit shocked. We really liked this hotel and the Chinese people were friendly and go out of their way to help if you need it. Not many people in China speak English but it wasn't a problem for us and most signage was in English too, even the subway makes stop announcements in English as well as Chinese. Overall hotel was great, and China was awsome! Must see's are the Wall, Summer Palace, Forbiden City, Teinamen Square, Temple of Heaven &amp; an acrobat show. The hotel can set up tours to any of these places and more, we used a tour for the wall &amp; acrobat show and explored the others on our own. Dec 10 2007	Very Nice Holiday Inn	Stayed in Holiday Inn Chang An West for three nights in Beijing. This particular hotel is a bit far off from the center. It is in the southwestern edge of the city and at least 30 minutes from popular areas such as Wangfujing and the Forbidden City. However, there is a subway station around 10 minutes walk from the hotel.To be honest, I was initially not expecting much from a Holiday Inn. However, I can probably say that this hotel is of four star quality. Though the interiors weren't any different from other places, this hotel gave off a pretty good ambiance. It could be because it was a relatively new hotel when I stayed there. The staff were helpful and gave me tips on where to go in the city. They knew how to speak good English. Maps of the city were also readily available in the counter.The rooms were very clean, well-appointed and most importantly, spacious. Standard amenities were included (toiletries, slippers, etc). High-speed internet was also available in the room, though it was certainly not free. I had to call for a technician to set-up my Apple laptop for internet use. Service was prompt and my laptop was ready for in no time. The breakfast buffet was okay. It was nothing special and the variety was pretty average. Aside from the usual Western fare (bacon, scrambled egg, etc), they also had some standard Chinese breakfast items such as congee, salted vegetables, etc.This is a good hotel overall. The only real downside is that it is a bit far from the center. Next time I am in Beijing, I would probably stay elsewhere simply because of convenience. Nevertheless, I still recommend the Holiday Inn Chang An for the traveler looking for good value but not really keen on a city center location. Sep 5 2007 	Nice Rooms	Stayed in Beijing for Business - had 3 rooms on the Executive Club floor. Service was good. Rooms were great - very large and clean. Bathroom was also very good. I had a seperate shower unit from the bathtub but that is not in every room. In room safe is handy. Executive Club offers 4 pieces free laundry per day which is nice for an extended stay. Free internet was good for business. Food was poor. Breakfast was good (custom made eggs) but lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurant was very poor. Very few Western or European dishes despite the restaurant being called Florence. Mainly Chinese food. Tried the satay in the bar but it was very tough. Red curry chicken in the Thai restaurant was good. Elevators slow in the morning but good bell hop service and access to cabs. Nov 6 2006 	Nice Holiday Inn	I just returned from a trip to China. First went to Beijing. There I met with a friend. We toke the airport bus to the hotel, and were dropped close to the hotel. We were in the Holiday Inn Chang An West and indeed it was a very good hotel. With swimmingpool and good massages for the body. But the temperature off the water is not so warm, 25-28 C.,so most of the time we had the whole pool for ourselves.But everything is wonderfully done and very clean.The breakfast was very tasty and western. The girls from the hotel where very helpfull and nice.The location of this hotel is on the west side of Beijing and with the metro, wich is 10 minutes walk from the hotel, you can get everywhere, cheap and quickly. If you get tired of huge Beijing you just take a taxi to the hotel for not so much money, or a bike.At the end of the street, where the hotel is situated, you have a whole street of restaurants, where you can eat cheap, good, clean and very interresting food.The hotel rooms were nice and clean, with a good shower and bad. Oct 24 2005	Holiday Inn Chan An	Just got back from Beijing for the first time really had a great time. My wife and Istayed at one of thenewr Holiday Inn's in Beijing and really loved the hotel. The rooms were fantastic with nice beds and very clean. Suprisingly they had quite a bit of room but only had 3 tv channels in english (discovery, cnn, and hbo). The location is good but if you are going to do organized tours don't be surprised if thye send a car for you to meet up with the bus at another hotel also your day will statr at 7am instead of 8am for most tours. Quite honestly though you can take the subway which is a ten minute walk and then another 10 to 15 minutes on the subway to reach the center of Bejing. From ther you can walk to Tian amen Square, Forbidden City, and Temple of Heaven. The subway will also get you to all the major shopping areas. There are a few thing that we weren't happy with. It is a long way from the airport and the ride is about 1 hour. Traffic in Beijing is pretty bad at al times. The hotel has 3 restraunts (Chinese, Italian, Thai) and we personally didn't eat at the Thai restraunt but wern't overly impressed with the other ones. We found no Italian food at the Italian restraunt and the Chines food was very greesy. Also a warning that a non-smoking section in China means that the table you are at has no smoking but not necessarily the ones around you. Thay do have a pool which I found not to be heated in October which I liked cause I like cold water but the two ladies I saw down there were pretty dissapointed. They also have a beauty salon but no one at speaks very good English so just order what services they offer and don't try to ask questions like my wife did cause it can get pretty frustrating.Overall though both my wife and I would highly reccomend the hotel and would stay there again if we ever went back. Oct 12 2021 	Very nice hotel"
"Nov 17 2021 	Hotel is OK...Service is Horrible	I brought my team from all over China to Beijing for a conference and we stayed at this hotel for two nights. When we arrived, we were informed that the hotel might not have hot water in the morning but our reservations were pre-paid so there was nothing we could really do about it! Then we discovered that the hotel’s main elevator bank wasn’t working so we had to use an alternative set of elevators that were located very far from our rooms. When I finally got to the room, it was really HOT. There were no windows I could open to cool off the room, there was no air conditioning that worked, and thus no way to cool down the room. When I asked for another room, they refused to move me until I threaten to leave the hotel. They finally gave in and found a room that wasn’t sweltering hot. All-in-all, if the hotel had things like hot water, well regulated temperatures in the rooms, and friendly service, it would be a decent hotel but I am not going back to give it another try. Nov 10 2021 	you get more than what you pay for	Booked this hotel after I had arrived at the airport and found out my flight home was cancelled. Furthermore, the next flight was not for 2 days so I was getting two extra nights and one extra day in China. Room was very spacious, clean, comfortable, and inexpensive. Close proximity to subway station and easy walking distance to Olympic Park. Oct 20 2021 	Great Value for Money	Hotel in good location with 10 minute walk to Olympic Park and five minute walk to subway. Out of city centre, but easy to get there by subway or taxi. Surrounded by wide new footpaths which are not too busy and provide a nice break from the chaos of the city centre.Entry is at the rare of the hotel via a small road, which is a little confusing at first.Several restaurants within easy walking distance.Breakfast was mediocre, although restaurant patio area nice.Internet fast and efficient.Room was nice and new, and a good size. Typical for HI Express.The only problem was that the air conditioning had been turned off (as of mid-October) and we found it a bit hot in our room.Service was good, but front desk was often very busy. Aug 22 2021 	Great base for a visit to Beijing	I stayed in a total of five hotels on my recent trip to China. The rooms in this hotel are without a doubt the largest. The showers are fantastic. I visited a total of ten days in this hotel. I loved the fact that there is a laundry room with washers and dryers. Also a section set aside for ironing your clothes. This is a great time and money saver especially when traveling with a family. Just throw your clothes in the washer and have a shower. Toss them in the dryer while you eat breakfast and you are ready to iron your clothes. So I recommend this hotel if you are staying for some time in Beijing. Another thing is the fact that they have a section where you can get a flight booked on the spot. I used this service and they were very good at helping me find a flight to Shanghai.This hotel is located within walking distance from the Olympic Bird's Nest and Water Cube. There is a subway located right around the corner from the hotel. I used the subway only once since taxis are very inexpensive. The fare from the hotel to the Forbidden City is five dollars US. The subway is about thirty cents US. The travel time on the subway is thirty five minutes which includes two transfers. The time with a taxi is about the same or more depending on the traffic. So as far as cost is concerned, you can stay at a similar hotel closer to central Beijing but you will pay so much more money. I recommend just setting aside the dollars for the taxi and save the money you would spend at another hotel. So location for me is still very good since you are in a more traditional Chinese area and not surrounded by tourists all day. Believe me, you will want a break from them since they are everywhere at the sites. Besides, the taxis are plentiful and the hotel can call one for you for an extra three yuan.There are five computers by the lobby that are available 24/7. All are super fast and never a problem. The breakfast is more traditional Chinese but you have a large selection. There is an outdoor section where you can have your breakfast. Very peaceful and beautiful with a pond. A perfect place for a relaxing drink after a day of seeing the sites. The hotel is extremely clean. Totally spotless. The rooms have very comfortable beds with wonderful sheets. A nice touch was a total of four pillows. Two regular pillows and one with a label &quot;hard&quot; and the other with the label &quot;soft.&quot; They even go as far as to make sure you are happy with a certain pillow. The rooms are spacious and include a love seat with a table and a full desk for your paper work. The front office manager, Jay Wu, is very helpful with local information and ensures that you are comfortable during your stay. A real professional. His staff is extremely friendly and do their best to assist with any questions. A few are still learning English but it is charming to see them get together in Chinese attempting to find the best solution and answer to a question. I have to say that these are really the nicest people you can meet and will do their upmost to ensure a pleasant stay. This hotel is really a hidden gem not only for the superior value for the money but also for the outstanding attitude and service provided by all of the employees. Very highly recommended!!! Jul 24 2021 	You get a lot for what you pay especially for a longer stay	An all-around excellent hotel with all the amentities needed for a longer stay--laundromat, complimentary internet and daily breakfast. Clean, spacious room and luxurious shower. The two downpoints are: breakfast and location. First, the daily breakfast was the same bland combinations of foods. Second, location--while you're close to the Olympic village, Bird's Nest, Water Cube, International Convention Center, you're far from the city's action and historical sites (minimum 15 minute ride). Moreover, 9 of 10 taxis did not know the location so you'll have to get a quick grasp of direction if you stay here. Note that it's near the McDonald's on Minzuyuan Road. It's a 5-minute-walk to the main road to hail a cab, or you can have the hotel call one for you for 3RMB extra. I also heard there's a subway station nearby but didn't have an opportunity to use it. Jun 10 2021 	Nice modern hotel and great value	This is a very new hotel 1 subway stop from the Olympic Stadium. My room was modern and typical of what you would find in a newly built HI Express in the US. It was good sized with a large LCD TV (only 2-3 English channels) and a large bathroom and a very large walk-in shower. (The water stopped totally for 20 min one morning - probably the city's fault and not the hotel's.) There was good closet space and a free in-room safe. The room overlooked a large atrium - the rooms which look outside are larger and cost more. There are 4 or 5 free computer terminals in the lobby. Breakfast was pretty much the same each day - it was basic Chinese food which may not appeal to Westerners. The hotel is 2 blocks from a modern subway station, but you have to walk down an alley which is completely dark at night - however, it is far safer than big cities in the US - Beijing is full of police and soldiers - this is a Communist country. Behind the hotel is the Chinatown shopping center (that really is the name in neon English letters) with a few fast food places and endless stalls selling all sorts of stuff. If you want to buy gifts, prices are much cheaper here than around Wangfujing or the other tourist sites - but you should still bargain. The front desk staff speaks adequate English. Most customers are Chinese tour groups, with a smattering of business types and Westerners. I booked for around $40 a night, which was great value considering how new the hotel is. Nothing special - but comfortable, dependable, clean, and safe. May 11 2021 	Great Price	Great Location, Excellent Price!! I went after the olympics and wanted to see the new buildings. it was perfect. walking distance to the Olympic venues. Somewhat of a drive anywhere else, but taxis are so cheap, it doesn't matter. breakfast and internet included (though breakfast was not too yummy). After staying in a fancier hotel (courtyard by marriot) this one is amazing for the price. Since its a new hotel, everything is super clean. I wish I would have stayed there the whole time; it would have saved me a lot of $$$$!!!! Apr 7 2021 	Not the place for a family	We ended up staying here for the Paralympics in September. A very mixed stay in terms of the hotel.First the good:1. Hotel seemed very new, the rooms were very clean and well maintained. 2. Compared to other hotels we looked at this one was cheaper and a great value for the money.3. Breakfast each morning in the lobby was great - Although it was the same each day, and after 10 days I was tired of it!4. subway stop right by the hotel5. free internet in the lobbyThe Bad:1. The front desk spoke little english, so was not able to help with getting around the city.2. It is located in a dark back alley, so it is hard to find. the picture you see from the website is not the main entrance, so it is misleading.3. There is not much around the hotel when we arrived. It looked like a mcdonalds was being built so that woudl be a bonus at this point.4. When we checked out the front desk would not call us a cab, so this was problematic getting to the airport.In short - I am not sure this is the place to stay if you do not speak the local language, or have a family. I was difficult to find things to eat by the hotel for the kids, though the mcdonalds that is being built would have been huge! Mar 5 2021 	Great value new hotel in good area by Birds Nest	I stayed in this hotel for a week in January and another week in March. This is a new hotel in the Holiday Inn group, which has numerous hotels in Beijing and elsewhere in China. The Express brand normally appeals to those on business - rooms are wll priced, they include a decent breakfast and broadband is free. This place attracts a lot of domestic bus tour groups. Staff here are excellent - quite a few English speakers. Hotel is about 2 blocks from subway, which is a real plus. Only downside is that the hotel building has a poor standard of construction. I've stayed in several rooms and the usual Chinese plumbing problems are everywhere. But overall this is a great value hotel and priced very well for Beijing. Dec 5 2008 	LIke an Ex I couldn't stay away from	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Minzuyuan for a total of about six weeks from September through October '08. The hotel has a few problems, but for the rate I got (between 300-400 RMB depending on how early I booked), it is a steal. This is an extremely nice, new, modern hotel. Free internet access (in your room if you have a laptop or in the lobby if you don't) and an actual laundry room (buy tokens at the front desk) were major pluses given my lengthy stay. On the downside, service could be a bit slow when the tour busses hit (which they often did), no attempt was made to keep people from smoking in the non-smoking dining area (Welcome to China!), a few times I had no hot water, once no heat. Given how long I stayed, however, I was bound to experience some problems.The area is a bit surreal. The hotel looks out on the Ethnic Minority People's Park, kind of a mini-Epcot to show how happy all of China's ethnic minorities are. Next to that is, I kid you not, a beautiful mosque that has been converted into an OUTLET MALL!There are several new Chinese fast food restaurants just behind the hotel and a new &quot;China Town&quot; (no kidding...I thought Beijing was a China town) with a first floor filled with shops selling traditional Chinese goods and a second more akin to the Silk Market. The hotel is near the Beitucheng Subway Station, at the intersection of Lines 10 and 8. That means it is not close to major tourist attractions, besides the Olympic venues which attract many Chinese tourists. Sep 14 2008 	Nice Hotel - handy local area	We stayed at this hotel during the Paralympics in Beijing. We were looking for a less expensive alternative to all of the &quot;official&quot; hotels endorsed by the local organizing committee, and this one was great.The hotel appears to have been newly built or re-decorated, as everything is sparkling clean and brand-new. The lobby and common areas of the hotel are beautiful, and staff are constantly cleaning to keep it that way. Our rate came with breakfast daily, and the food was pretty good. The daily offering was pretty much the same, with Asian and western breakfast basics such as toast, jam, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fried rice, congee, eggs, tea and coffee, and juice. Food is refreshed constantly, so we never had to wait for anything.Hotel staff is very polite, and try very hard to speak English, although some do better than others. The front desk staff all speak a bit of English, and one or two quite well.The rooms were well appointed, and the bathrooms are GREAT! It had the best shower I have ever experienced in a hotel - it was large (big enough for at least 2 people), and had a large, luxiourius spray. Soap, shampoo, toothbrush and paste, hairdryer are provided by the hotel. We found the beds a bit hard, but we got used to them after a while. The TV was a large flatscreen.The hotel was within easy walking distance to the Olympic Green (20 minutes), and there are lots of local restaurants, including take-out places. Overall, a great experience. I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it Jul 12 2021 	????????"
"Nov 6 2021 	Beyond Expectations	Upon our arrival we were please to find that Holiday Inn had met our request for an early check in of 7am! The rooms were way beyond our expectations - after a long day of sightseeing we could look forward to returning to the comfort of our room. The free wi-fi in the rooms and the computer terminals provided at common areas were a real bonus. Receptionist were helpful. Only possible downside is the location - not walking distance to a subway. However it is very conveninent and relatively cheap to catch a bus or cab. For the price paid and the quality of the rooms and service provided, I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Beijing! Oct 15 2021 	much nicer than expected	This was a lovely hotel. The rooms were large, comfortable, clean and well equipped. The bed was by far the most comfortable I experienced during our month in China. The hotel has great facilities that include computers with free internet access and a laundry room. Its a good 20 minute walk to the nearest metro but its not an unpleasant walk. There are a few restaurants and a big supermarket close by. My only criticism of this hotel is that the breakfast sometimes fell short of the other high standards. If you are an early bird then the food is hot and plentiful but for the last hour of service the staff have a tendancy to let the food go cold and stop replacing things. Sep 26 2021 	Good hotel	I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only things that I did not like is if you went to breakfast around 7:30am instead of 6:30am it made it vary difficult to find a seat to eat and the food goes quick so you would have to wait till they bring out new trays of food. I also found that the hotel was pretty far from most places and I found it pretty difficult to get taxis some nights. The nearest subway station was about 25-30 minutes away. Aug 25 2021 	Great value for money helpful staff	Stayed 3 nights in August 2021 (bad month to visit Beijing, its too hot!!). The hotel is either new or has undergone extensive renovations recently, so the rooms are in a really good condition. The free WiFi is fast and easy - both, my laptop and my phone connected without a hitch. They also have free internet terminals (I think there are 8 of them) for guests to use.The breakfast spread is OK, though not great. The one big problem is a strange smell in the rooms - apparently they have some sort of sanitation issue. However, since we hardly spent time in the room, thats was bearable. Also, the hotel is far from the touristy bits of town (Forbidden City, the lake area etc.), but taxis in Beijing are cheap. However, as we found out, getting a cab suring rush hour can be quite an experience (we waited 45 minutes and walked a few miles before we got one willing to take us back to the hotel one evening).The best part about the hotel is the staff, especially Mike the Operations Manager - flexible and anticipating guest requests and fulfilling them quickly. Even housekeeping did quite a good job. There was another friendly woman at the front desk, but I forget her name.On the whole, really good value for money, considering it is an Express by Holiday Inn. Aug 24 2021	Great Value for money	I've checked into the Holiday Inn Express - Temple of Heaven after staying in the Westin Beijing, Financial Street for 2 nights - and i didn't feel like i've been banished to some dodgy hotel (that's a good sign). Don't expect a bellboy to bring your luggage - do it yourself. That's why the hotel is able to give u the damn fantastic rates for the room nights WITH breakfast included. the Great Room is the in-house restaurant. I'v ordered a Sweet &amp; Sour pork rice &amp; a Kungpow Chicken Rice @ RMB$38 each. Pricey by Chinese standards, but it's a quick fix and is tasty. Comes with fruits and a bowl of soup. Yummy. Breakfast is not too bad. (I am not a fussy person). THe locality is in a suburb area - so its relatively safe. I don't feel like i have to watch my back when i am walking back. Also, there are rows of small eateries about a 7mins walk if you want to try the local food, along the walk to the Temple of Heaven. I've tried this restaurant, &quot;Hangzhou Eatery&quot; (With a red signboard) and it's run by a couple from Zhejiang province. Their speciality is their dumpling (served till around 8pm) and buns (only in the morning). Do try it. It's really yummy - and i've tried Crystal Jade, Din Tai Feng's before, and not that i haven't had the best..so this is good &amp; cheap. All in all, the Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven may be not that convenient or near a train station, but it's comfortable and it feels like going home.. Aug 19 2021 	budget hotel good value for money	It was a bit difficult to locate the hotel since some taxi drivers are unfamiliar with it. But make sure that you have the hotel write the address in Mandarin and mark the location in the map, this will be very helpful. Via taxi, it is 20 mins away from Wangfujang shopping street (because of the traffic) and 20-30 mins away from the Forbidden City. and 5-10 mins from the Temple of Heaven. The rooms are not that big but not cramped. It has all basic toiletries including slippers. No minibar/fridge though. The bed and pillows gave me a good night sleep. However, some construction seemed to be ongoing during the day so it would be a bit difficult to sleep in during the day. Staff are nice but there were only 2 people manning the reception desk, and no one to carry the bags. Breakfast was not so good but I guess this was expected for the price.Also, I was lucky enough to discover a local market nearby where you can buy fruits, vegetables at non-tourist prices (i.e. 1kg peaches for 1.5 yuan). Aug 17 2021 	Great value pleasant stay am going again	My first tip is have the address written in Chinese and explain where it is located. It is new and most taxi drivers are not familiar with the location although it is near the Temple of Heaven.Breakfast is buffet and has a big variety. Go early if there are groups staying there. Can change money at the desk. Make sure money is in excellent shape or it will be refused.The room is comfortable and internet access is free. Computers are in a couple of areas but I always carry mine for convenience. Explore the neighborhood if you have time, There is a hutong nearby that we enjoyed visiting. You can walk to Hongqaio market and there is a new market next to it that is good to visit. Hongqaio is good for pearls and knockoffs. For pearls of good quality go to Josephine on 4th floor. I have dealt with her for 8 years and she is very honest. Feel safe to have her mail things. There is a noodle place across the street from Hongqaio and it is a lot of fun.People at Holiday Inn express are young but very capable and attend to whatever you need. I liked this place better than the 5 stars I have stayed in there. No refrigerator in the room which was not a big deal for us. Rooms are quite. I am staying there again leaving for China tomorrow. Aug 17 2021 	Good Value	We stayed in this hotel from 7 August for about 7 nights. The room was clean and modern. It is really value for money. We booked the room at about RMB200++ per night inclusive of 2 breakfast when they were having the &quot;Asia On Sale&quot; Promotion. Although the hotel is a bit out of the city centre, however, the public transports are very conveniently access to most of the places and attractions. There is a bus stop near the hotel. You may take the bus no. 102 directly to the Zoo at RMB1.00 per trip. Besides that, you may also take bus no. 102 to the &quot;XuanWuMen&quot; station (subway line 2) which can bring you to most of the places that can access by the subway....If you are coming from the Beijing International Airport, you may take a shuttle bus from Airport terminal (which will cost you about RMB16 / pax) to Xidan and from there to take a taxi to the hotel will cost you about RMB20.If you are taking taxi all the time, please inform the driver that the hotel is in Nanwei Road in stead of the hotel name as most of the driver are not familiar with the hotel name. You may also tell them the name of the hotel but must inform them it is at Nanwei Road as the driver may bring you to the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven instead.Please do a lot of homework if you are intend to explore Beijing yourself by the cheapest way as the reception are not so helpful in giving direction and they will only ask you to take taxi. (Probably, they are not so familiar with the public transport system)Overall, it was a good experience. Jul 22 2021 	Great location for local sights but problems with the room and service	Could have been a lot better really - the service was just average with difficulty understanding English. We took 2 rooms as they couldn't accomodate all 4 of us in one room and our room was a bit smelly - terrible view of a building site and lots of rubbish and then our air con broke down the last night (but while we were asleep) so we woke up all hot and bothered. Having said all that - the location is great - very close to the Temple of Heaven and the Pearl market (if you take a rickshaw back make sure the price is negotiated up front - we did this and they still wanted 40 euro!?? yeah right!) and if you walk the opposite direction there is a yoshinora and a large park. Jul 20 2021 	Good value. Located in good proximity to bus line bank nearby restaurants	Very reasonable pre-paid rate.Arrived late into PEK, took taxi to hotel for 130Y (got Yuan from exchange in airport). Taxi no problem - I had everything in Chinese characters and had a google map just in case -The driver used both. The hotel desk clerk spoke English and was very efficient with check-in. I told her friends were arriving by train at 6am and asked if their rooms could be available when they got in - they were able to check-in early with no issue and she grouped our rooms together on the same floor. I did note there were several tour buses at the hotel. European groups: French and Italian. A very nice group.Breakfast Buffet 630a-10a was PLENTIFUL: juices, coffee, cereals, fruit, congee, salad, noodles (lo mein), rice, vegetables, bread, eggs and meat. Very nice staff. There are neighborhood restaurants, convenience stores and street vendors very close (walk). Room: Clean / Simple, typical US Holiday Inn Express with a slightly smaller room/bath. Beds are a bit hard, but the pillows and linens were nice quality. Hairdryer a nice feature. There is no alarm clock, bring your own or ask for a wake-up call. Plenty of outlets (chinese). 42&quot; flat screen English and Chinese channels should you have the time to watch. Good water pressure. Windows open if desired. Climate control worked well.Wake-up Calls and Taxi: They record these requests manually in a notebook - but they executed each time - quite nice. Had a taxi to the airport back and the driver arrived 30min early - we were ready for him. When we left - the desk clerk didn't spoke very, very little English - which was okay as we needed nothing other than to say we are checking out - he happily said &quot;OK.&quot;Internet: Free Internet, 6 workstations I think and WIFI.Vending machine in lobby. Jul 18 2021 	no fridge	great hotel , free buffet for breakfast, limited items for the restaurant, good staff, free computer for tourist, cosy room with satellite tv and cheap for beijing. great value. my only complaint is no mini fridge, strange ...... how could any modern hotel not have a mini fridge , its very hot in july and if u want a cold drink u need to got to the lobby to get a drink from the soda machine. hard to imagine what they were thinking when the built the place. be sure to take a hotel business card with the address for cabs. there is a IGA store down the street with any type of drink or grocery u need. restaurants are everywhere within a block or 2. the value is very good with this hotel Jul 15 2021 	Cant be better lol	That was my first time to live in the Holiday Inn Express Hotel. The room i was living in was clean and luxurious. I could also smell the natural scent from the lobby. The service was helpfull, so I really enjoyed the trip in Beijing. Everything was awesome, the people, the service, the environment and the food. I will go there again next time I visit Beijing. Jul 2 2021 	Good Value	We booked the hotel directly at the Holiday Inn website. While the location wasn’t the best, we still booked this hotel because of the buy 2 get 1 free promotion going on!Anyway, it’s only a short cab ride to Hepingmen or Qianmen subway stations, Tiananmen Square, etc. It's 700 meters from Temple of Heaven, we went there by cab as well. It's easy to hail a cab from the hotel and they are not expensive. The room was well appointed with a queen size bed and a sofa. Breakfast was free and adequate. There are 5 computers free for use at the 2nd floor by the breakfast area.We consider the hotel a good value for the price, even without the promotion. Jun 21 2021 	Good hotel a good 25min drive away from shopping	We stayed two very comfortable nights at this hotel on the south side of Beijing. Hotel was really nice and clean and reception staff was very helpful when checking in and when we needed a taxi.We had a room next to the elevators so we did hear sounds at night after closing the tv which was not so nice but not a bog problem.The biggest problem I had was the breakfast --&gt; it was horrible to us being scandinavian and used to smorgasbord style breakfast !Taxi from the hotel to the Silk Market was very cheap; only 25 yuan ! Free internet was a superb surprise ! May 29 2021 	Good deal but average hotel	Beijing has such a wide selection of hotels, it's hard to decide where to stay. This hotel offers 1 of the best deals as it's a HolidayInn Express, with free internet &amp; B'fast. Room is great but the reception staff is not efficient nor helpful. When I arrive, the girl standing at the reception didn't know how to check in for us! 5 mins later, another staff came by to help us out. This hotel is not near to any subway station but one can take a cab to WangFujing or the main train station for 20rmb. Temple of Heaven, TianQiao Acrobatics theatre and TianQian cultural theatre (where one can catch international troupes performing SwanLake, dances) are within walking distance. HongQiao Pearl market &amp; the famous RoastDuck Restaurant QuanJuDe Main branch are within 10 min cab ride. For the price, it's a great deal for groups who have their own transport to ferry them everywhere. For individuals, be prepared to pay for cab rides to get around.Alternative for individuals, consider Novotel XinQiao, slightly more expensive but no free b'fast. However the subway station is just right there with lots of other shops n' restaurants nearby. May 19 2021 	Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven was a good value and a good find.	We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Temple of Heaven and it was a newly constructed wester style hotel. It was very clean, had high speed internet at no extra charge, a walk in glass shower, and they provided us with a free hot western style breakfast every morning, also had chinese style food. The staff was very helpful and professional and the hotel had a room dedicated as a laundry facility with washers and driers, iron and ironing board, and washroom and a big screen tv. The dailey rates were also very reasonable. We liked the hotel very much and give it a very high recommendation. May 14 2021 	Wouls stay here again	My family, wife and 9. y.o. son, stayed here for a week, we'd stay again if we return to Beijing. The rooms were clean &amp; modern, only complaint was with the shower nozzle spraying water everywhere, no big deal. Staff was wonderful, free breakfast buffett was very good, get there either early or late to get a table, the room fills up with guests going on bus tours. Free internet on 7 different hotel computers. This is a quiet residential area, good for sleeping, taxis are easy to hail and only cost about $2US to go downtown to the Forbidden City, etc. Take a card or map from the hotel with Chinese characters for the name of the hotel to show taxi drivers for for your return trip, they don't speak English. Before you get in the taxi to go back, make sure they nod to show you they know where the hotel is, about 50% didn't. In fact, show them the Chinese characters for wherever you want to go.For a great cheap massage, cheaper even than downtown, exit the hotel, make a left and go the end of the street, 1 block. Turn right, go about 100 meters, there is a hair salon on the left. After walking around wonderful sites, parks and hutongs all day, a 1 hour foot massage for $7US is incredible! May 7 2021 	Clean New Rooms but so-so service	Stayed 3 nights. Surprised to see new/ modern/ clean rooms. Staff were not friendly except for one receptionist. Since this is Holiday Inn Express, we got free breakfast and free internet! Good value for money. Breakfast selection is good, except that the menu doesn't change much every day. You get the same food everyday except for one or two. Location is a bit far from downtown but taxis help make up for it. Place is exceptionally quiet which is a big plus! Walking to the hotel from Temple of Heaven takes about 10 minutes. Apr 23 2021 	Long way from the sights	Adequate hotel but be prepared to walk long distances or use taxis to get anywhere, no subway stations close by but a nice quiet residential street. Reception staff were poor. Rooms were good size and breakfast was very good with a mixture of chinese and western options, so good value altogether. Apr 18 2021 	clean comfortable reliable - a pleasant surprise	we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express, Temple of Heaven for 3 nights whilst visiting Beijing. Located in a quiet residential area, taxis were easy to get and Central Beijing was at most 20 minutes away (depending on traffic). The rooms were comfortable, clean, recently refurbished. Reception staff were generally helpful. Breakfast was fresh and more than adequate. I would definitely recommend this hotel - very good value for money. Apr 14 2021 	Not fancy but great value for the money	We found the service and staff at this hotel to be very good. The hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very clean and modern. High speed internet and a buffet breakfast were included in the price of the room. The breakfast buffet was good,though not a large selection of food. Laundry facilities are also available at the hotel and were very clean and reasonably priced. Although a little tucked away, the hotel is a cheap cab ride to just about anywhere you'd like to go. Mar 22 2021 	Pleasant 	I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express on Nanwei Road &amp; was pleasantly surprised. The staff here were so friendly &amp; very helpful. Despite the hotel being a little out of the way &amp; I'm use to walking lots in every city I visit, Beijing without a doubt is massive so take a taxi to most places or to the nearest metro. Both are cheap....The hotel is very competitively priced &amp; is a nice walk to the temple of heaven. It's only 35 minutes walk to Tiananmen Square. Rooms were clean, modern etc.....I can only see this hotel getting better &amp; better...I hope to return. Mar 18 2021 	Good value for money	This hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and very helpful. The menu selections were limited but there were local restaurants close by. The rooms were very clean and the facilities were adequate if you are like us who don't need a fancy hotel since we are out all day anyway. Feb 16 2021 	Great hotel	Before we left for China, I did a lot of research on hotels and attractions. The hotel choices in Beijing is staggering--so many choices! Many hotels seemed to have issues with cleanliness so when I finally made reservations, I decided to go with brand names I was familiar with and the choice for Beijing was this hotel.The hotel staff was very helpful. We arrived early in the morning after taking an overnight train from Xi'an. Our rooms (2) were both ready. We were scheduled to go to the Great Wall early the next morning and before we even checked in, we had arranged for breakfast and a bag lunch for the next day--and the wireless was working on my mobile device as well. We were also invited to get breakfast for that day. When we returned later that day, our train tickets for the next part of our journey were delivered during the day and were waiting for us at the desk.The rooms were both better than expected--very clean and well appointed. The bathroom was great. We had been in Tibet for two weeks and had very poor experiences in one hotel in particular so this was very welcome. The location was fine. It is a fair distance from the subway station but with the location near the Temple of Heaven, it was easy to give directions to the taxi drivers to find the hotel (our son speaks enough Mandarin to get by), and there were plenty of taxis in the area. The breakfast was very good with a mix of western and local choices. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here very much. Oct 6 2008 	New Clean Convenient	The holiday inn express is everything it promises. A new hotel, clean rooms, clean sheets, no nonsense service, dependable buffet breakfast ... you get what you pay for - a good choice if you want to avoid more expensive places in BJ.Its location however, is not very convenient if you plan on using public transport. The nearest subway needs a taxi (probably 15-20mins walk). Sep 18 2008	At the right price a good value choice	I also stayed at this property during the Olympics (it was also a good deal using Priorityclub points).The previous review is very accurate. But my perspective is slightly different. I'm giving it 4 stars based on VALUE. Assuming you can get a room here for about US$60, it's a good comparative choice. The hotel has what you NEED. About 7 free internet terminals (another luxury hotel in Beijing charged me a quarter a minute!), an excellent free breakfast with many Western options, and a self-serve laundry room (very rare in China, and very convenient). The rooms are modern and nice (although my bathroom had that occasional mild sewer smell). The map location shown on the Holiday Inn website is wrong (or at least was wrong last month). The hotel is about 5 blocks west of the west entrance to the Temple of Heaven. Not much of great interest to tourists in the immediate neighborhood (other than the Temple of Heaven). No easy subway access, but the location in convenient by taxi to the city center, and taxis are very cheap. If you don't mind relying on taxis, you will find the location to be pretty good. Sep 7 2008 	Affordable option during the Olympics	At a rate of 939 CNY per night, this was one of the only moderately priced hotels available during the Olympics. The daily breakfast buffet increased the value of the rate. The buffet featured Western dishes (bacon, scrambled eggs and sausage) as well as a few Chinese options (fried rice and bok choy). The hotel also serves lunch and dinner, but has a very limited menu of a few Chinese entrees. The hotel opened just a few days before we arrived, so the staff was still getting the hang of some things. However every request was handled with a smile and earnest effort. The front desk staff was able to give us information on arranging a tour to the Great Wall. The rooms were comfortable with a modern decor. My room got a thorough cleaning daily, but as I was out all day most days I don't know how long it took for housekeeping to come around.One of my travel companions had plumbing problems with his room, but was moved to a room that didn't have any issues. The whole neighborhood seems to having sewage issues, as a horrible odor sometimes came out of the gutters and pipes. The neighborhood seems to be going through some gentrificaiton. While we were there an IGA supermarket opened down the street and a coffee shop was on the opposite corner from the hotel. The neighborhood felt safe but was a little blighted with a vacant lot across from the hotel.The hotel is walking distance to the Temple of Heaven, but not centrally located to many other tourist attractions. Despite claims of being close to the subway, it's about a 30 minute walk to the Hepingmen station. However, it's a very short cab ride to the Tiananmen Square, Forbidden City and the Wangfujing Shopping area. We relied on cabs for the majority of our transportation. The hotel staff helped us immensely by writing our destinations in Chinese to give to the taxi drivers. (We also had to be sure to have the hotel address in Chinese for our return ride. Since it was a new hotel, no one was familiar with it). The Hongqiao Pearl Market is on the east side of the Temple of Heaven, which was about a 25 minute walk from the hotel. The Yuan Long Silk Store is also close to the market. A branch of the popular restaurant for Peking roast duck called Quanjude is next to Hepingmen station. A McDonald's is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel on the way to the subway. There aren't a lot of other options around for Western meals. All and all it was an adequate stay for budget travel. Good for bargain hunters, but not very convenient for tourists. Pros: price, free broadband internet, friendly staff, complimentary bottled water, lcd tvCons: location, thin walls, shower w/o tub, no irons or alarm clocks in rooms, plumbing odor Nov 1 2021 	Hotel genial joya escondida Sep 13 2021 	Schönes Hotel zu einem guten Preis Aug 4 2021 	hotel agréable Jan 23 2021	?????????? Dec 31 2008 	?????"
"Jul 29 2021 	A Reasonably Good Place to Stay	The hotel is close to the airport - a 20 minute taxi ride. I agree with another reviewer, taxi drivers do not know where it is - even though I had the name of the hotel and address in Chinese. The hotel is not too far from the sites if you take public transport, and even using taxis is not that expensive. See my tips.The room was a good size with a firm bed, crisp linen, great pillows and a good bathroom. The shower floor was a little mouldy in places and a tile was cracked but the shower-rose was the largest I have ever seen and, coming from a country where water restrictions have been in place for quite a while, I felt somewhat guilty at the amount of water emitted from the shower. However, I soon succumbed to the decadence of long luxuriant hot showers!The room has a flat-panel TV, bar fridge and clock-radio with an iPod dock.The hotel is above Focus Mall - an upmarket shopping mall and across the road from a shopping plaza - Stellar International Cineplex - which has approx 20 restaurants, a liquor store and a Department Store which has a Supermarket on the ground floor.The hotel staff are efficent, although they cannot speak English very well, so getting directions anywhere can be difficult but not impossible. The breakfast was fine - usual Asian style and also some concession to Western tastes. Coffee is extaordinarily expensive everywhere in China, so use the little automatic coffee machine in the restaurant for your caffiene blast for the day....it doesn't taste too bad.The hotel has 2 PCs in the lobby which allow free internet access however they are often occupied. In the restaurant on the 5th floor where breakfast is held, there is another 2 PCs, not often used....so just go there.Overall, I would recommend this Hotel as I was pleased with the cleanliness and general location.TIPS: If you want to get to Tian anmen Square and the Forbidden City using public transport, it will take approx an hour but only cost 6 yuan round trip! Ask at the Front Desk - their tour co-ordinator will provide a map of the city and give you directions. It involves one bus ride and two train changes. Worth the experience.If you want to go to the Summer Palace - and you should not miss this fantastic place - catch a taxi. It will only cost 50-60 yuan each way and is well worth the money when you see just how far the journey is. It is approx a 25 minute ride. It is usefull to have the various attractions you wish to visit written in Chinese so that you can simply show the text to some unsuspecting local and get directions if you are lost. Also useful for the taxi drivers. Remember, almost NO ONE speaks any English.I booked a Great Wall tour through the hotel because I couldn't be bothered booking on the net - however, you can save approx 150 yuan by booking on the net. Go to the Mutianyu section - it is a longer trip there but absolutely spectacular. The hotel arranged tour spent only 2 hours at the Wall - not nearly enough time. If you can afford it, hire a car for a day....approx 600 yuan.The Supermarket in the Stellar complex has everything you need and also has a small pharmacy. It also sells cold beer at 1.5 yuan and different wines. Nov 12 2018 	Excellent Hotel	It's a brand new, clean hotel with modern furniture and amenities. It's perfect for someone who is transitting in Beijing, as it is very close to the airport. It's situated near a large shopping center, but other than that, there is not much within walking distance. The only down side is that not many taxi drivers seem to know where the hotel is, even with a map written in Chinese. All of my taxi drivers on 3 separate occasions did not know where the hotel was, and had to call the hotel for directions. Breakfast is excellent. Sep 7 2018 	Nice new hotel	This was a new hotel, It opened 10 days before i arrived. The room was nice, comfortable bed, nice new linens. Flat screen TV, in room safe. Incuded in the price was a breakfast to order.My only complaint was that one of the two elevators would sometimes come to an abrupt stop on the ninth floor. Not a good feeling since I was on the 18th.Also free internet. Aug 19 2018 	Great value during Beijing Summer Olympics	Unlike most of other hotels in Beijing with sky-rocking prices during Summer Olympics, Holiday Inn Express Wangjing offered very reasonable price during summer 2018.The hotel was brand new and just opened in early August. The front desk seemed not familar with the checkin procedure and was very slow and made some mistakes with our reservation, but we ended up with a very nice room on the 17th floor - new, modern, and big (rooms with ending with &quot;10&quot; are the bigger ones). Free internet in room and public areas. Free and tasty breakfast. Excellent service from housekeeping and restaurant staff.Since the hotel is new, most of the taxi drivers don't know where it is. It is located next to Hua Tang Shopping center (with many restaurants). Taxi to Olympic stadiums cost about 20-25 CNY. Sep 21 2021 	?????????????????????"
"Nov 25 2021 	Nice Hotel for Beijing but Not 5 Stars!!	On arrival into the spacious driveway of the Holiday Inn, Temple of Heaven, it is easy to be impressed. This is the most modern looking building within blocks of the area. The front lobby is very large and open but is not inviting. The staff at the front desk are very attentive but do not speak anything close to conversation level English. My wife and I received our room of two twin beds, which we had been advised about when we booked our tour package. The room was located on the fourth floor and was very spacious. The beds were spaced out far enough apart so that we were not crammed. The room had a small bathroom but large walk in shower. The bay window overlooked a bustling Beijng Street. A window seat made it nice to sip wine or beer and take in the local atmosphere without hacking up a lung in the smog. The only knock I had about the room was that the heat was always on, even when we attempted to turn off the heat, and even turn on the air condition, the room was like an oven. Granted, the temperature outside was 45 degrees farenheight, the room was very warm. The beds were comfortable for twins, and the television had the standard CNN/Headline News, HBO Asia (which is in English and shows Western movies like Lethal Weapon,) and ESPN. The Business Center does charge to check email 10 Yuen for 10 minutes and there is a grocery store directly across the street. Be forewarned we were told by our private tour guide NOT to walk the streets of the area after dark as the neighborhood is less than desireable. However, we were in walking distance of the impressive Temple of Heaven, and an easy cab ride to Tiannmen Square and the Forbidden City. Our room rate came with a daily breakfast buffet which served American and Chinese food. The buffet was excellent our first day and below average the second day but free is free. A very nice no frills no thrills hotel, but we had a very comfortable stay Nov 1 2021 	Comfortable hotel but the service needs improvement	The hotel is very nice, clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our room. The service on the other hand is another matter. They wer not helpful and borderline lied to us. for example, we asked the staff where we could find the closest laundromat or dry cleaner and they didn't know of any and suggested that we use theri sevice. After a quick stroll in the neighborhood, we discovered a few, including one right across the street. Besides that, they had menus with diffrent prices and tried to over charge us. The breakfast buffet was very dissapointing for $15. We ordered a la carte one morning to have the staff use the eggs and bacon directly from the buffet and not cook it up fresh. The rooms were well priced, but everything else they have ther is way overpriced. Oct 20 2021	Seafood buffet - tremendous	Yes this is a chain hotel but it provides all you need for a short stay - good beds, bathrooms and breakfasts - actually the breakfasts wre excellent and the staff very attentive. The dinner buffets were superb too - and excellent value. Sep 13 2021 	Still lovely	Not much too say,,,still lovely hotel..stayed in room 1501 on 15:th floor this time between 30august-5 september..This was our 2.nd stay at this hotel, and have nothing to complain about this time either.Read our 1:st review from April to find out what we liked. Jan 21 2021 	Good Value and clean rooms	Having read the various reviews we decided that this would meet our needs. We chose the business rooms, which are located on the 14th floor. Both our rooms were upgraded as one had a faulty thermostat and one the lock on the door was faulty. We were very pleased with our new rooms which had more space and were very clean. We chose to eat breakfast in the hotel on one occassion. They had a good selection of food but a little pricey. A 10 minute walk takes you to the metro and a slightly longer walk will get you to the Temple of Heaven.The staff were always helpful with taxi directions and writing places in Mandarin for the drivers. It was a pleasant experience especially as it didn't break the bank!! I would recommend this hotel but take a business plus room to enjoy it to the fullest.Diana Guangzhou/UK Nov 11 2018 	Nice room but sterile place	I chose this as a low hassle starting point for my trip to china. It lies in a reasonably central location and is about 10 mins from a line 5 underground station. Probably 15 min walk to the temple of heaven park. The hotel's situation is quite nice, pretty quiet area - not particularly touristy at all.The room was comfortable and of a decent size with a nice powerful shower - albeit a slightly stale shower curtain.The lobby is a bit of an empty cavern and the evening buffet dinner expensive, tired and uninspiring. Breakfast, while quite pricey was good though.There was a bit of a buzz upstairs in the KTV karaoke lounge - but these are private booths and being a lone traveller i didn't hang around long. Taxis cost a shade over 100RMB to and from the airport. It is possible to take the metro and this might be advisable if travelling alone at peak hours since the roads get quite clogged. Oct 30 2018 	Thanks to tripadvisor I get this fine hotel	I was looking for a hotel in Beijing for a 4 night stay at about $100s and found good reviews for this hotel at tripadvisor. I was not deceived! We got a realy nice room, the staff was very professional and the breakfeast was very good. Even if the location is not very central, a 10 minutes walk to the subway station put you everywhere in Beijing. The only point is that smoking is allowed indoors, but it is not a problem specific for this hotel, this is China. Oct 17 2018 	Loved the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven--Again!	In October of 2018, I stayed once again at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven hotel in Beijing. This was my third stay, and I was very pleased, as usual. I stayed on the executive floor for about $100/night and considered it to be a very good deal. Although the hotel does not do a very good job of publicizing it, all executive floor rooms come with an excellent free buffet breakfast, a laundry allowance sufficient to clean a pair of pants and shirt daily, up to six free juices or local soft drinks from the mini-bar, and free coffee, tea and soft drinks all day long in the very pleasant executive lounge. There are also snacks and two free alcoholic drinks daily available in the executive lounge, but only during a designated happy hour period. All in all, I found my hotel experience to be top notch. The room was very clean, the bed linens (and towels, to a slightly lesser extent) were of good quality, and the housekeeping staff did a good job. The concierge staff was very helpful and friendly and the front desk clerks were efficient and pleasant. The employees in the hotel restaurants were particularly customer-oriented--after specially requesting pineapple at the breakfast buffet on my second morning at the hotel, I found it delivered without fail to my table for each subsequent breakfast. In addition, once the staff learned that my sister and traveling companion had a bad cold, they specially fixed her ginger tea and ginger in hot Coca Cola (an established and trusted Chinese cold remedy, apparently) and delivered it to our table. This hotel is really a gem. I will say that my executive floor room was considerably nicer than the one standard room that I visited during my time at the hotel, so I would recommend spending the extra money to upgrade. The location of the hotel may not be the most central, but with the new subway station nearby, it is really easy to access other parts of the city. I found the subway station to be a pleasant 10 minute walk from the hotel, and at 2 RMB per ride, it is a great bargain.Don't miss out on this great Beijing hotel! Oct 5 2018 	Decent Hotel Option	Altogether, the experience you get at this hotel is what you would expect. The service was fine and the rooms were clean and by-the-book. The only real downside was the ludicrously high charge to use the internet in the business center - the worst I experienced during my two weeks in China. The location wasn't amazing, but it's only a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station, and it should be noted the Beijing subway system is top-notch, so you'll be able to get anywhere you want to go fairly quickly from there. Sep 21 2018 	Great Value	This hotel is a very good value for Beijing. Like everywhere we went in china, though, it was a good value because it wasn't too close to anything. the nearest metro stop was about 4 blocks away. we always managed to find a good pastry shop along the way to the metro. Very clean rooms. They gave us as many complimentary water bottles as we wanted. I would definitely stay here again if i went back to china, despite the location. the staff also was very helpful in telling us how to get to every attraction. Sep 8 2018 	Really liked the HI Temple of Heaven	Very nice hotel. Clean and well appointed. Good facilities. Desk staff spoke very good english. Silver-service in their dining areas. Loved the breakfast! Family friendly. Kids loved the heated pool... although we had to purchase a swim cap (AU$9 each!) Great value for money. Although expect it to be a good half hr drive to where most tourists stay and shop. Cheap taxi's though! Jun 29 2018 	Excellent Hotel	I have just spent 5 days in Beijing staying in this hotel. My family and myself is very happy with this hotel. I will say this is one of the best hotels I experience. First of all, all the staff (reception, restaurant, doorman, even the lady that clean the room) are very friendly, polite and helpful. My daughter got sick on the last day we were there, not only they recommend the hospital that suit our need, they also extend my check out time for two hours so that I can handle the situation comfortably. Frankly saying, I think their service attitude is the best that I have experienced in any country. Everybody work there has very good attitude!!!This hotel has all the facility you will need on a touring trip or business trip. The room is not really fancy but still roomy, clean and comfortable. It has great value and the kids eat free. I especially like the buffet breakfast that they supply. It has both Chinese and Western food and the quality of the food is very good. My kids grow up in Canada and I don’t have to worry about finding food that fit their diet.I saw some of the reviewer complain about the location. It is a normal residential area for Beijing resident. It is perfectly safe. I personally like this location because I can go to the grocery to buy local snack and bottle water and not paying the premium of the tourist location. I also find a store that sell excellent local pastry. There is also local dry and wet cleaner that can wash the clothing at a very reasonable price (5 RMB/clothing, underwear is done by weight).I realize this hotel is not in the main tourist area. I went downtown where all the action is twice during my visit. Beside that, all the other tourist area is on the outskirt. When I don’t have to go downtown, I avoid getting there. If you saw the traffic jam of the downtown area, you will understand why I prefer not going there. I cannot imagine going through that traffic everyday if I live there. Since I have two young kids, I am not looking for party every night.I am sure that I will go back to this hotel on my next visit. Jun 15 2018 	Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven- Great value	I stayed at the Holiday Inn- Temple of Heaven at the beginning of June 08 and was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a hotel it was. The lobby is very nice, the staff great and the rooms while not overly large where very clean. I didnt find its location bad at all. Close to the Temple of Heaven and the Pearl Market. Cab rides to other places where also very reasonable. Overall, for the price I thought it was a very good value especially with the included breakfast. Apr 18 2018	Amazing hotel amazing experience	The Holiday Inn - Temple of Heaven is by far the best Holiday Inn chain hotel I have ever visited. Unlike HIs in the United States and Canada, the hotel has amazing concierges, friendly staff, spacious rooms and halls, and new furnishings and decorations. The staff was helpful with writing out the chinese characters for all the places we were going, and helped us out getting Z-line trains to Xian with little effort. Furthermore, while the breakfast may be overpriced to some travelers, you have the ability to order a-la-carte, thus having a 5-6 USD breakfast. Overall, the service is what sets this hotel apart. Jan 5 2018	Great place to stay !	We booked this hotel through a travel agent, total 9 of us, we enjoyed the stay, the rooms are very comfortable, clean and quiet, the buffet was excellent. You can find anything you can have in Canada. Plus it is in a residential area, you can simply walk to a cornor store to pick up some drink/beers.The service was nice, since we join the local tour, we always were picked up from the hotel, so the location seem perfect for us. We definitely recommend to our friends. Jan 3 2018	Clean place	My wife and I stayed in this hotel and also at the Holiday Inn in Shanghai (which is much, much better). The rooms were clean, the staff polite and friendly. A woman in the business center was particularly helpful. The breakfast buffet was good. Plus, we got to see how people live since it's in a residential area. Go out for a morning walk and you'll see all sorts of interesting stuff -- including people carrying birds in cages (they are taking the birds out for a change in scenery!). Oct 27 2007	A nice Surprise from a picky traveller	I usually stay at a 5-star property (China World or Grand Hyatt) but I'm here for just one week on business and didn't need the extra ammenities or price. I reluctantly booked this hotel after reading other reviews and was very pleasantly surprised! The lobby is large and modern, and the location is not bad depending on where you are going. The room (regular not club floor) is average size, good ammenities and a big plus for me...free broadband Internet access. The on-site Heavenly Cafe was also a big surprise great value and great service. My husband and I had 2 beers and 4 dishes for about $10. For regular Beijing travellers who are used to staying in hotels at the $150-250 range this is a welcome budget friendly hotel at 575rmb!. Aug 16 2007 	Excellent Value Hotel	I recently stayed here for 3 nights. I also stayed at the Holiday Inn Central Plaza on my recent visit to China and in comparison i was not disappointed with my stay here. I got what i consider a great room rate for a Suite Room. This included access to the Business Lounge and Breakfast was included.The hotel location is not central, but a short affordable taxi ride will take you to most sites in Beijing.I believe this Hotel is ideal for people visiting Beijing who would like to sample 'local' life. Stepping out of the Hotel you are in a local area and not the 'touristy' areas that most people only see and experience. There are plenty of small eating places and shops close by.My room was a little dated and would need upgraded, but for the cost of the room i consider it was good value for money. I am sure when they upgrade the hotel they will also upgrade the room rate.To conclude i would have no problem recommending this hotel, both for value for money and friendliness of the staff. Jun 1 2007 	Too expensive for remote location	The previous reviews mentioning the location were on the money, this place is remote. Without Chinese I think it would be impossible to get to/from this hotel. No taxi drivers knew the hotel even when I showed them the card, every driver had to call to get directions. Furthermore the traffic is so bad in Beijing that location is key. There are other international brands that have much better locations for the same price.The hotel itself is fine, the service is fine, the rooms are fine, the food is fine. Nothing great. My key complaint is the cost, it is simply too expensive for how average it is and how out of the way. May 24 2007 	Excellent Choice	My family and I stayed here for several nights while sightseeing in Beijing. The hotel is clean, the staff professional and the price a bargain (I booked at the Holiday Inn website). Although not in the center of the city, a taxi ride to Wangfujing costs only about 20 yuan (and there are plenty of taxis), and bus 803 goes directly there from a stop immediately behind the hotel for just 1 yuan. My children loved the fairly large indoor pool. The hotel's dinner buffet left something to be desired, but there are plenty of decent Chinese restaurants right out the door. I will definately stay here again when in Beijing. May 9 2007	Temple of Heaven Hotel (Holiday Inn) Beijing	the Temple of Heaven hotel is approximately 10 minutes drive south of the Temple of Heaven attraction. Its' located in a residential area but has a nearby supermarket (signposted outside the hotel) and restaurants within a few hundred yards. I don't know if the supermarket had any English speakers. The hotel facilities are of conference standard. The desk staff have enough english for their job but didn't seem able to deal with queries that weren't absolutely specific. I had a query about a phone message which was left for me. Even showing my piece of paper failed at first to elicit a reply: though I was impressed by the sudden decision to ring the mobile number on my paper for me. The two restaurants were *excellent* for their evening meals and also the breakfast menu which covered both western and Chinese foods.We had to have breakfast extra early a couple of times and the staff were willing to provide some dishes of both Western and Chinese at that hour. The staff were eagle eyed and attentive and as a visually impaired person they quickly remembered I needed a bit of help to carry my soup dishes to my table. None of the staff spoke fluent English by any means which may be a problem with the Olympics. My room was comfortable, though the smart card I had wasn't infallible by any means and I needed help from fellow guests once or two. Their smart card key had to be swiped down and it didn't seem to locate positively at all. One also has to be aware of 'turning on' the electronic lighting system on arrival. My UK guide failed to explain this to us : maybe its standard in Holiday Inn hotels and didn't need explaining, but I am a notice to hotels. Great idea to have small radios in the room. Reception was a little on the difficult side: even though I was listening to China Radio International whose studios are in BeiJing, though I did manage to live with the quality for the first 3 nights. On our return on the final night of our holiday we were in an 'annexe' and the radio reception was appalling.The TV really should have better instructions for its use. It seems to be that its assumed that everyone owns their own TV. Well, I don't and I had to ask one of my fellow travelling companions if there was any problem with reception because I had a real problem turning the set on. Once I did I was most impressed with the range of channels in Chinese and English language. The hotel shop had an interesting range of goods but the staff had minimal english skills even for their jobs. Considerably less than the desk staff. Apr 11 2007	Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven Beijing	My husband and I stayed at this hotel as part of our Classic China Tour with Travelscope (50 group members). The hotel was excellent, very clean, the rooms were very luxurious, and the staff were wonderful. I sent a fax to my mother (she is very deaf so it is my only way of communicating) and it was dealt with immediately and for a very low price. My laundry was handed in at 0800 and was returned, washed, ironed and on hangers at 4pm - again for a very reasonable price.I have to follow a gluten free diet, and breakfasts can be difficult, but I was spoilt for choice here, there was so much food of every variety on offer - I certainly did not feel hungry!!If I am ever lucky enough to go back to this wonderful city, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very very good value and very helpful friendly staff. Mar 31 2007 	great value excelent location	We stayed for only 50€ including breakfast, and for this money it is the best choice in Beijing. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and restaurant, very comfy and the room, although smallish is well apointed and nice.We also stayed at the Westin and the location of the Holiday Inn is much better. We went walking to the Temple of Heaven, about 20 min. through a very interesting street. It is also not far from the forbidden city and the silk market.It is more than enough if you are looking for a 5star without high-end luxus and service. Mar 3 2007 	Awesome but a little overpriced for a guy on a budget	This place was great. Biggest problem in China was finding people to understand english. This hotel had an abundance of workers that were able to help.Rooms were very clean and well stocked with everything you could want.It wasnt too far from most attractions, not far from the tennis centre. Taxi's are cheap anyway so you can get around.Unfortunately, compared to the dodgy places, this Hotel was very expensive. around $60 - $70 AUD a night. It was definately worth paying to have some staff who could speak English! Nov 8 2006 	Loved the Holiday Inn	We just got back from two weeks in China. We stayed about 4 nights at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven. It was hard to depart this hotel as the staff was so dedicated to making our stay as comfortable as possible. The hotel room was very clean and very well kept. We felt spoiled each time we got back to the hotel from a day out in the city with a very clean room and access to the reasonable priced 24/7 spa. The breakfast was full of various selections of western and eastern foods to the point that it felt as we had a feast each time we had breakfast. Overall, this hotel is one of the best hotels I’ve stayed for the price we paid. We liked the location as it was very close to the Forbidden City, and the temple of heaven. Another thing we liked about this hotel is that it was located within a neighborhood, which allowed us to get a taste of the everyday lives of the peoples in Beijing. This hotel made our stay in Beijing a memorable one. In fact, when we went on with our trip to other cities, we often talked about how wonderful our stay at the Temple of Heaven hotel was compared to the hotels we stayed in other cities. I would definitively recommend this hotel to others. Nov 7 2006	Horrible Location	The hotel is new and has a great breakfast buffet. The rooms are nice and it has cable with multiple english channels. HOWEVER, it was a horrible location. I was traveling with my mother and we had an extremely hard time finding a cab that would take back to the hotel from Central Beijing. Overall, I would not stay here again solely because of the location. Jul 9 2006	Touring with Teenagers	Just stayed in the hotel as part of a tour package. As the other reviewers said, this is an excellent value and great overall holiday. Not in the center of activity, but we were with a group of teenagers who didn't have far to stray as a result. Good facilities, free internet access and refreshing pool in the summer heat. May 9 2006	Great Hotel!	What great rooms I found at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven Bejing - at about $68 for a single on the Holiday Inn's website. It was less than the rate quotes direct from the hotel - but it's always great to check all options. It has everything I like when I travel including a decent health club, plus robe and slippers, coffee maker, free high speed internet, and it's bright because of the large windows. They also had a non-smoking floor. The bed was fairly comfortable and had a great silk comforter. Try to buy one when you are in China.The service from the hotel staff was impeccable and very friendly. The restaurant had a good buffet breakfast with everything including omelettes, fresh eggs to order, etc. The dinner buffet was fine - although we didn’t find a lot of great restaurants generally in China, unless you stay at a 5 star Western Hotel. Since we were picked up by the Tour Company, we found it fine for location. Not too far from the Pearl Market. Will absolutely stay there next time I am in Beijing. Jun 28 2005	Impressed	Extremely clean, neat and new!!! Excellent choice for the price and the staffs are extremely helpful. Food at the restaurants in the hotel are better than expected and very reasonably priced. The only downside is the location which is a little away from the city centre and half the time the taxi drivers do not know the exact location even with the map of the hotel. Nevertheless, I will recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very comfortable and clean hotel room to go back to at the end of the day. I have stayed at a supposedly prestigious hotel nearer the city, it is nothing compared to this holiday inn which is at half the price. Jun 20 2005	Great place to stay!	We were very impressed with this hotel. The place is much nicerthan most Holiday Inns in the Usa. We were greated and assistedwith much care. The location is not the best but the hotel is great.We had a massage for $20. for 45 min. You cannot beat that!There are 3 restaurants. The breakfast buffet was plentiful.A variety of foods from different countries. The taxis are cheap toget to the pearl market. The Temple of Heaven is only a 15min walk.However, I do recommend to travel in a group as you are walkingthrough some areas that are a little scary. We did not have a welcomefeel as we walked through this area. We had a van take our group of 5to the great wall and ming tombs. We were disappointed because theydid not get an English speaking driver for us. So we could not get anydetails....wish we would have taken the English speaking tour instead.For the $75 a night we were very impressed Sep 23 2021 	Sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel in Peking May 10 2021 	Muy buen hotel Jan 18 2021 	???????? Sep 4 2007 	Modernes Hotel mit sehr vernünftigen Preisen Mar 7 2007 	bon hotel mais deception"
"Aug 5 2021 	Ok for a couple of nights	We were booked into this hotel by a tour guide with a link that showed it a 5 start hotel. Had we not expected a 5 start hotel we probably would have thought higher of this hotel. By American standards it is probably a 2-3 start hotel.We are well traveled Americans in Beijing for sight seeing and traveling with two tenage boys.1. The beds were hard but that was to be expected for Asia. We asked if they had a soft topper for the beds (some hotels have them for Western guests) but they did not.2. The bathroom was fine but the showers were stained from use.3. The towels were terrible...very soft but not cotton, you could not dry yourself! I ended up using the pillowcases!4.They had a flat screen TV but only one channel that was English speaking and it seemed to repeat itself a lot.5. Breakfast was good...lots of variety. You could get toast and butter!!6. They had free wi-fi in the lobby and they also had a computer you could use. Only problem was that it was in Chinese so you had to remember which buttons were yes and no.7. Not many Westerners there.8. Walls were thin...hear what our neighbors were doing.9. We could not comment on the location as we had our tour guide pick us up and drop us off in the morning and night.I know this all sounds negative but I like to know what I am getting myself into. If I went back to Beijing I would not stay at this hotel. I would look for a hotel that catered more to Westerners. We travel all over world and have been to China several times and from our own experience we like to come home to a comfortable hotel where you can relax. This was a hotel where you came back to sleep and shower (and drip dry). Jun 28 2021 	Good BUT BEWARE	This is a nice faciility, the rooms were clean and modern, that's about all it has going for it. The staff spoke limited English. The entire 3rd floor where the small gym is has the lights turned off when the gym is closed, as I found out when I couldn't sleep at 4AM. The breakfast is included but has the same food choices every day, I got tired of it after the 2nd day.BIG WARNING!!! They tried to get some more money out of me when I was checking out, said I broke a floor lamp. We went back into the room with the manager and the scummy looking bell hop said that the lamp shade was hanging off about to fall. I told them no way and stormed out of there. I'll see if this shows up on my VISA. They also tried to get some extra money from my tour guide saying he broke a wooden hanger.Oh, the hotel is also located a the end of a street where there is major building construction occuring, even into the night and early morning hours. Nothing like trying to sleep when there is a lot of machery buzzing around outside."
"Jul 21 2021 	Easy Access to Subway	Staying for 5 days in this hotel. Quite hard to find and taxi driver did not know where it is. Fortunately we meet a westerner who know where the hotel and we follow through his direction to the hotel.The hotel is near the subway station (sanyuanqiao) and the station is also ABC (airport beijing city) station. Therefore, easy access from the airport (the ABC train) and all over beijing city (subway).Some reception staffs can not speak english but they are helpful. Quick check in. Breakfast voucher must be collected at the front desk everyday. Breakfast is not that generous but worth the price.Overall nice and clean room. The bed is soft (compared to other hotels in China).You must take and collect your laundry by yourself at the front desk, they wont deliver it to your room.Since the food selection is not that great, we walk to the the Novotel Sanyuan Hotel just back-to-back with Ibis Sanyuan Hotel.There's no free mineral water in the room, so you'd better buy some to stock at your room.Free internet on the lobby! Jun 22 2021 	Great for Westerners	We were impressed with the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the hotel. Even though we did not speak a word of Chinese, everyone was willing to accommodate us. We stayed for 8 days since the hotel is close by our daughter's apartment. There's a little Western grocery a short walk away, so if you're really craving some Oreos and candy, you can surely get them there. The room was bigger than we expected, at least bigger than some that we had in London. HBO was in English as well as a few other channels, but we were so busy seeing the sights that we didn't have time to do much else but collapse from our adventures. The hotel seems to be a bit away from the major attractions,but with the moderate price of the subway and the taxis, this was not a problem.We paid $42 a night and an additional $2.93 for breakfast, so the Ibis was a real bargain. The breakfast buffet was a Chinese breakfast, which we enjoyed. The hotel is located in Phoenix City, which appears to be an up and coming area of the city. We would definitely return to the Hotel Ibis Sanyuan. Apr 30 2021 	Just OK	We were really happy with the Ibis in Xian. We considered it the best value of the 2.5 weeks we spent in China, so we were hoping for the same standards at the Ibis in Beijing, but it fell short. The rooms were OK, but a bit worn for being such a new hotel. It opened last year. Worst parts were the lobby and hallyways and bar -- not clean and the bar always smoke-filled. There were q-tips and dental floss on the hallway carpets when we checked in and they were still there the next day. There is construction going on all around the hotel right now which makes coming and going difficult. Advantage is that it's around the corner from Line 10 subway stop which is convenient. Not too many good places to eat, but a few. Try the nearby Northern Village. Ask the hotel to direct you. This Ibis is convenient for coming and going to and from the airport, but that's about it. You could do much better location wise and it would be worth it to pay a little more to be in an area where there is more going on. Mar 5 2021 	Highly recommend for value cleanliness location	I would highly recommend this hotel for its location and if you are lookingfor a basic clean hotel without the extra frills. It is your typical Ibis hotel setup. It is very reasonably priced. My family and I stayed here in Jan. 2021 and paid approximately $200 RMB. When we checked in, they quoted us a higher price. But, once we told them we saw a lower price on the internet, they honored the lower price. This hotel is located in a great location for a stay in Beijing. It's located at the first stop (Sanyuanqiao) into the city from the airport train. This makes it very convenient for taking the train in and out of the airport. The subway stop is also right at the hotel. The subway system is so convenient that there's no need to pay the higher prices just to stay in the city center when this hotel offers the convenience of catching both the subway and the airport train. There's not much of anything around the hotel in terms of restaurants/shops, but with the convenience of the subway, it's easy to get to shops/food. At the time I was there, they were still building what looked to be a shopping/apartment complex next to it. I would definitely stay here again if I were to go to Beijing. Nov 13 2018	Good Value for Beijing next to subway	This is a new Ibis- one of many now being opened across China. Very good standard Ibis rooms, with queen size bed, desk in front of window and small wardrobe, timber style floor covering. Free internet in the room. International TV channels including BBC World, French TV NHK and HBO. Standard Ibis modular bathroom works very well. Its clean and with relatively soft bed (for China). The hotel is located on the 3rd ring road in Chayoang district not far from Sanlitun and Lufthansa center. There is nothing else in the vicinity, so you need to take the subway to get anywhere. The hotel is right next to the Sanyuanqiao subway station on the new line 10. Its also the first stop on the Airport Express train from Terminal 2 and 3 (which costs 25RMB). Subway is good and cheap (2RMB) and will get you anywhere easily including Olympic Park, Silk Alley market, and central sights (T Square). Beware of the steps from the Station if you are hauling luggage. Pick the right exit when you leave the station (its signposted in English). The Ibis is behind the Novotel. As of mid November the hotel was still not finished and the paving still had to be done outside the hotel. The room is good value (348RMB weekdays less weekends), but other things are pricey. There is no bottled water in the room and Evian is 25RMB in the bar. Other bar prices even worse. The breakfast is 20RMB but its not very good (much worse than Ibis Shanghai). Overall a very good choice for Beijing where other 3 star hotels are often not very good and 4 star hotels more expensive. Nov 1 2018	Work in progress	The inside is finished, but just barely -- the rooms still smell of paint and heat wasn't working properly. Outside, the street is still under construction, and it took half an hour for the cab driver to find the entrance, through the back of a large housing compound. Once they've worked out the kinks, it should be a great deal -- but they're not quite there yet. Oct 12 2018	Clean comfortable cheap and convenient hotel!	Great clean hotel with the subway just around the corner. Quite convenient coming from the airport- it's the first stop on the airport express train- get off at exit D at the Sanyuanqiao stop. Little market as you exit the hotel- make your first left. There's also the best restaurant we tried in Beijing named Another Northern Village within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Sorry, the address is in Chinese but the number is [--]. No english menu but the menu has pictures for every dish and for once the dishes actually looks like the picture. Totally yummy, clean, busy, and cheap that we went back again.Back to the hotel- Free internet, friendly and helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again!PS- the room looks exactly like the picture on the website. Aug 26 2018 	Fantastic value for money with a convenient location !	We stayed at this hotel for one night during the Olympics and we were really pleased.After a reservation went wrong at another hotel, we scrambled around and found that the Ibis at Sanyuanqiao had JUST opened (they were still putting the finishing touches as people were checking in), along with a Novotel, right next door.Ibis is generally known for being a no-frills hotel chain across Europe, and they are now making in-roads into China, where there are already lots of local chains covering this segment of the market. But Ibis comes in with a MUCH higher quality offering at a rock-bottom price, which makes it a perfect choice when visiting China.As I've just mentioned, the hotel is _brand new_, not even a month old at this point, so everything works, and everything is clean (except maybe the surrounding areas, as they're still constructing other buildings around). The room is cozy, a good size for the price, it's clean, and functional. Broadband internet is included in all rooms with no extra charge, so that's always a nice extra. There is a 24-hour snack bar and a cafeteria that can do the job of filling you up, as there aren't many dining or shopping options around.The location at Sanyuanqiao is definitely not central, and it's a bit hard-to-find, tucked away into a new development area, but here's the trump card: the Metro station is literally at the door step- a 2 minutes walk, maximum. And from Line 10, you can access all the major sites (in our case, the olympics sites) within 15-20 minutes, on the cheap, at only 2 yuan per ride.All rooms were aptly priced 888rmb (about 110usd) for the olympics, which was not cheap (but within market range for the olmypics period), but the regular price afterwards is around 264rmb for single, and 364rmb for double, which comes to about 35-50usd, definitely an excellent deal. At this price, if you're visiting Beijing and just want a cozy, no frills, clean place to sleep at night, no matter your budget, Ibis Sanyuanqiao should be at the top of your list. It will be for us when we go back, for sure. Sep 14 2021 	Muy buena calida-precio Aug 28 2021 	????D????3?"
"Sep 13 2021 	What a disaster	What an absolute and complete disaster. This hotel will never be a 5 start hotel of international standards with service as it is. I came here because one of my Shanghai contacts recommended it. Know as a hotel where all of Shanghai business people stay, perhaps it is better recommended for Chinese travelers. English speakers beware as everyone’s English is minimal. I paid top price to be on the executive floor. Rooms are very small compared to comparable hotels and prices in Beijing. The laundry is “included” in the price and done on premises. Sounds good in theory. Unfortunately for me, the hotel doesn’t stand behind their work. I have a ruined Armani Sport shirt and bespoke navy blue blazer. Let me share my experience. I had gone out the day before, walked around Beijing in the summer heat all day, went to lunch and dinner and smoked a cigar. I was wearing the shirt and coat all day. The next morning I handed the blazer and shirt for pressing to the “butler” which they provide on the Exec level. When I returned at the end of the day, I found on my bed, in two bags, my blazer in a ball in one bag and my shirt in another. The shirt was spotted. My blazer had two brushed pewter buttons ripped off of each sleeve. It had also shrunk. I called the front desk manager, Mr. Phillip Hao. Rather than coming himself at first, we sent up the housekeeping manager, Mr. Deway Huang. Mr. Huang, insisted the clothes had not been cleaned but returned to me because of the missing buttons and spots on the shirt. When I opened the shirt bag and smelled the shirt, no cigar or sweat smell, only cleaning agent smell. I asked for Mr. Hao at that time and he came to the room and acknowledged the smell of cleaning fluid. This was done in front of my Chinese guest, so there are witnesses. The cleaning fluid smell certainly contradicted Mr. Huang’s statement that the shirt had not been cleaned. Further, the coat had no cigar smell either. Mr. Huang tried to get me sign the slip that came with the shirt and jacket. It was written in Chinese, and my Chinese colleague pointed out to me that what they were trying to do is sign the acknowledgement that my shirt and jacket were damaged before I gave it to them. Real underhanded. The only thing that I can imagine is that the hotel laundered the coat and dry cleaned the shirt (a “no dry cleaning” shirt). After two wasted hours (8:00-10:00 pm) Mr. Hao said he would have the hotel manager get back with me the next day. Well the hotel manager has never appeared. He sent a second assistant manager in place, Mr. Jason Lee, who did nothing and had no authority. He was supposed to be at my room at 9:15, but at 9:45 he had not yet arrived so I called him and he then came up. Mr. Lee said the housekeeping had tried to reach me during the prior day about the buttons and jacket but I wasn’t there (of course I as out). When I asked why they didn’t leave a message, Mr. Lee said that they didn’t speak good English. As an attorney, it didn’t make much logical sense that they would come to speak to me about it but didn’t want to leave a message. Well, I am out an Armani sport shirt, about $68 and a bespoke navy blazer, about $800. The laundry really isn’t so free! So beware. I also had the impression that they would not have treated a Chinese person this way. Perhaps because I as am American and not one of their favored or Shanghai guests they felt I didn’t merit the manager or a decent resolution to this matter. This hotel has light years to go before becoming a five star hotel and will not be getting there anytime soon. Aug 16 2021 	too much little aggravations for business traveler.	I booked a single room (1 night) with this hotel for reason of our company rate just the same as usual Renaissance and Raddisson.On top the negotiated rate was including free airport transfer to the hotel. So thought let's try. Well... on my way from Europe to Beijing (in Helsinki) I phoned the hotel for information how to get the Free airport transfer. Then the assistant manager (Kelvin) say's to me the rate (which was already confirmed, but 25% higher as our company rate) was not including a free airport transfer. I told not wanting to discuss by phone but rather take a taxito the hotel and sort things out the next morning at check-in.When checking in the personnel found very deep in their books that I had a company rate and I was granted itin return of giving them my business-card for hotel-reference.only the free airport transfer they could not find (could be mistake of our site; have to check). Then when asking for miles for my frequent flyer program, I was told this could not be granted at our company rate... tell me, this is the first ever occurrence I was refused a mileage-reward program. The room was OK but old fashioned furnished; need re-decoration. al basic and standard stuff was availableHowever wonder if they put me in their worst room, for paying our company rateThe breakfast was very wide assortment, but also here too much details which spoiled the fun of having a better then average enjoy. There was f.i. a cheese pattern with 6 different European cheeses.... only one knife for all to cut. The final drawback for me came when starting to eat with the fork, knife and spoon. These tool, I can assure, will never bee stolen from the hotel by any guest as a souvenir, since they simply are not made for the job: Too heavy, no grip, ....; these are probably still the reason they are arround (NEED REPLACEMENT)The two really positive point of this hotel is the spirit of its serving personal, who try to make the best of it for the guests in a building-environment from the mid 80's and the wide assortment for the breakfast. These are the reason I rate this hotel as &quot;average&quot; and not &quot;poor&quot;.This however can not pursue me to ever book this hotel again.I will not recommend it to colleges and others. Jun 10 2021 	superb service on executive floors	Excellent hotel with beautiful rooms, excellent service and helpful staff. Good value on executive floors May 19 2021 	Superb rooms	Had stayed for 5 days with Kunlun, during a business meet in Beijing. Royal rooms one can't dream of at rates as cheap as INR 5000- 6000. Room had a small study and nice spacious bedroom. But of all the bathroom was excellent. I havent seen such large bathroom in my life :) with a huge bath tub with a LCD in front of it and city view by the side.... really royal bathroom... I fell in love with it..... Even the restuarant is good... for breakfast they have a huge huge layout and there is a revolving restuarant on top floor. Good news for Indians that this revolving restuarant serves Dal Makhani and Roti/ Jeera rice and even some chicken/ mutton cooked in authentic Indian style.... It was really dream come true to find Indian food in Beijing Apr 28 2021 	Beautiful	I was on my business trip to Beijing, China. I stayed in the suite in this hotel. Beautiful room and very comfortable stay.See the suit rooms in the photograph below. Jul 16 2017	Nice hotel but terrible location	Overall, the Kunlun Hotel is a nice hotel in terms of quality and price point. But the hotel's location is not the greatest. It is far from everything that is remotely interesting or fun such as the markets and touristy sights such as the Forbidden City, Tiannamen and Wangfujing.But if you are a tourist, stay somewhere in the city centre (Wangfujing or around the major sights), as traffic is horrible and public transportation is not an option for tourists unable to communicate in Mandarin. May 11 2017	no character nor charme	Unfortunately this hotel was not up to my expectations.First of all you can't leave the place at night to go for a quiet walk without being pestered by all sorts of touts, prostitutes and beggars and once you have passed this crowd , there is not much to see in this far out area, next to a very important highway.the service in the hotel is neither attentive nor particularly friendly, you often have the impression the staff would rather be somewhere else..some exceptions to the rule like jessica from reception and the the ladies from housekeeping.maybe its the management thats doing something wrong, but i really think this hotel is neither up to its reputation nor its room rates. Apr 4 2017	A great choice	I have stayed twice at the Kunlun, and will not be dissapointed if you choose this place. The rooms are nice and comfortable, the service is superb and the staff very friendly and professional. It is a big place, but it never seems to be crowded. Nightlife in Beijing does not seem too exciting to me and there are not many places to go around in the neighbourhood (despite the good and central location), so if you are a business traveller like me, you might just want to stay in the hotel, relax and enjoy it. The choice of excellent restaurants and good bars they have there is very impressive, so you can select a different one every day. Mar 12 2017 	Fabulous hotel experience	My first trip to Beijing. Even though the hotel had some renovations ongoing, they did not materially affect the quality of my stay.First impression - stunning. The lobby is absolutely beautiful! See my photos posted separately (sorry for the quality, taken with my cellphone). And the rest of the hotel is a visual feast as well. The only negative I would offer is that the gift shop is minimal.This is for the most part a world-class hotel, in service, accomodations, and amenities. The staff is attentive, we found the food to be excellent and varied (although if you aren't adventurous and insist on Western food, you may be disappointed - but that would be missing the point), and the executive room was sumptuous and very comfortable. By the way, we booked through our local host, and were upgraded to executive rooms upon check-in, all for about 1200RMB/ night - you do the math, but a bargain in every sense. Dec 3 2006 	Professional and comfy	spent little over a week here for work and must say its very nice and the staff is very good. because of the lenght of the stay I met some good people that helped me pick the best spots - ones not always on the map -the food was top noch and the buffet was always the spotfresh everything - great blend of western, euro, and asian food.could always find some thingthe bed was awesome - super firm and comfythe place was always clean and the staff very politei found little extras some nights after work or exploringlaundry was fast and professionalover all the place was very clean and very well rungreat service and peoplewould stay agian in a second... no second thoughts Oct 26 2006 	When in Beijing	Stayed here for 6 nights - very attentive service - rooms excellent - beds turned down at night - large spaces - 8 restaurants offering a variety of dining but you must try the revolving restaurant on the 29th Floor - be weary though the staff will greet you but do not expect them to understand much English May 25 2005 	Executive Level - 21 and above very very nice!	Very nice - executive level that is. i believe 21st and above. Completely renovated. beautiful rooms, comes with bulter. free food on the top floor. great bathrooms. employees all speak enough english and are VERY friendly. they are still renovating the lobby. and it is quite smoke filled on the main level. i had a non-smoking floor and it was fine. no problem. Apr 21 2005 	Nice place	I stood at Hotel Kunlun during a business trip for 2 days. The hotel is still in renovation, but most of the hotels interior is already finished. Only the entrance hall is still under construction. The rooms are somehow spacy, clean and everything in it. Even though nothing special. Breakfirst was included but nothing special either, except that they offer a wide range of different things to eat (for Asians). But the quality was only average and below. Bad thing about my room: on the oppersite side of the road a construction was going on, even at night time - very loud. I probably could have changed the room but I didn't ask - so my fault. Another highlight is the cafe on top of the building where you can look over Beijing - marvelous. And: People are very nice though! Oct 15 2021 	??????? Oct 4 2021 	??????????????

"Nov 26 2021 	Best place for travelers	Hotel was very nice, the room was wonderful and really fit the price. We got 9 nights in the hotel and we were very please and happy . we got a lot of fun and enjoyed our trip. We got really nice services with the staffs. And very honest.Thank for the hotel’s service . you are great you did very good job. Nov 21 2021	Good 3 star with WONDERFUL staff	Beautiful lobby, best staff - very helpful and competent. They were always willing to go the extra mile for our demanding group. Great suggestions for things to do especially since we had several free days. Excellent location near the best fake goods shopping at the Silk St. Market. HAGGLE LIKE HECK there and be prepared to get a headache very quickly. Also, loved having the great hot pot restaurant around the corner (don't eat at McDonald's - this was the ONLY place in China who's food made someone in our group ill). Hotel had great breakfasts, especially the custom soup bar and dim sum. Did enjoy the thai chi entertainment. Of the three hotels we stayed at, this had the best location and food but was definitely not a 5 star in terms of room. Room was somewhat conventional and small. But the maid was very diligent and conscientious about keeping room spotless and well stocked. The pool, fitness center while very nice, took forever to get to. Bathroom amenties were the worst, poor quality shampoo etc. Glad I'd bought my own. Overall would say to stay but don't have high expectations of the room itself. Oct 16 2021 	Nice hotel.	Nice hotel. The position was excellent and the staff was very helpful. Would stay again. Jun 21 2021 	Good hotel - worth a stay!	I stayed one night at the New Otani in September 2014. This Japanese style hotel was recommended to me by a friend from Beijing, so I had high hopes. I wasn't dissapointed. Good rooms. Good location (good Peking duck restaurant nearby). Nice swimming pool and Japanese bath facilities. Nice breakfast with plenty of choice. Would probably return, as there's so many hotels in Beijing to choose from - at least I know that one was good. Aug 8 2018	Central Location Comfortable Hotel	As part of a tour group package, we stayed 4 nights at the New Otani Chang Fu Gong Hotel in Beijing. The hotel is centrally located on Chang An Avenue, the major east-west artery that runs past Tien An Men and the Forbidden City. It is a good choice if you cannot afford to stay at the luxury hotels near Wangfujing Avenue. The public areas are top notch and very well maintained. There is a casual buffet restaurant and a pricier Japanese restaurant onsite. The rooms can comfortably sleep 2 (but probably not more) and the furniture and condition of the room was fine. The beds were quite firm and comfortable and the duvets made for a good night's sleep. Our view was over the busy Chang An Avenue. One of the best features of the hotel package we received was the daily complimentary breakfast buffet that included both Asian and Western breakfast items. There was a huge selection. The hotel complex contains a health club that includes a huge squash court, indoor swimming pool and fitness aerobic room. The spas included separate mens and womens soaking tubs and saunas. The Line 1 and Line 2 subway station Jianguo Men is an easy few minutes walk from the hotel. It requires walking on the pedestrian underpass access of a very busy intersection, but not much of a problem as long as you cross with the locals. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the touristy Silk Market and Friendship Store, as well as a Sizzler, TGIF, 7-11 and Haagen Daas when eating chinese food everyday becomes burdensome. Overall the central location was a hit with us and I would consider returning. Mar 6 2018 	Very Nice Hotel	The New Otani is a great hotel. It was very lovely and did live up to boasts on the various websites. It is a very modern hotel with very Euro/Modern furniture. The hotel room was roomy, very clean, the staff in the restaurant, business center, front desk and all throughout the hotel were very helpful. You can tell that the Chinese in this hotel have studied hospitality and demand that all of it's employees practice it. It was a in a great location in central Beijing, near restaurants and shopping. The ammenities that you would expect to find in a 5* hotel are all there, including sattelite TV, internet access, etc. There were a total of 6 of us who stayed in 3 rooms and we all were quite satisfied with the hotel. Nov 2 2017 	classy hotel	Luxury hotel with elegant, clean and well-equipped rooms. Unforgettable tasty and wide-ranging breakfast and dinner, served in a elegant restaurant overlooking a peaceful inner japanese garden. Further thematic restaurants (i.e. japanese) on the first floor. Swimming pool, indoor tennis/basket/volleyall courts and luxury day-spa with beauty salon inside the hotel. We totally loved our stay here!!!! The unique imperfection regards the restaurant waiters, absolutely not appropriate to the standard of the hotel. Jun 8 2017	Great location	Stayed at the New Otani Beijing for three nights. Best of all about this property is the location. Great indoor pool and fitness room. Had the best Peking duck dinner next door at a restaurant called Duck King. Also next to the hotel, right next to McDonalds is great massage place that was very classy, clean, with great service. We like the massage place so much that we visited for two consecutive nights. The downside about this hotel is the worned out carpet and the bathtub/shower in the rooms we stayed in. Otherwise the hotel is reasonable and the breakfast is adequate. Apr 12 2017 	We would stay at the Otani again	My family stayed at the New Otani in late March while we were in Beijing as part of a three-city China vacation. The Otani was our favorite hotel during the trip. The lobby was spacious and the staff were eager to help you with bags, questions, etc. The rooms were fine, but ours was a smoking room which we did not like. We called the lobby and they sent someone up promptly with some air freshener spray. Breakfast was good as well. The dining room was big so you didn't feel crowded with other guests. And the wait staff were quick with more coffee and to take your dish when you were done. The only bad thing was that the hotel was located on a busy road so you couldn't really cross the street unless you went to the overpass. We sort of felt like we were away from the city center a bit. We would stay there again though the next time we're in Beijing. Mar 3 2017 	Great Value for Money	Stayed here on business for 1 week at the end of January. Found the check in and lobby to be quite pleasant. The lounge is a bit small but Beijing has so much to offer theres not much point staying in. Room size was very good and bed very comfortable. Bathroom was spotless. Hotel staff very friendly and generally efficient. I found the western breakfast to be a bit average but the asian breakfast looked good however theres only so much Chinese food the body can take.The best thing about the hotel is the location, just 2 minutes by taxi to the silk market (where you can buy the best fake goods), Anything you can think of, just ask and they will have it. Remember to pay only about 20 percent of the asking price at most. Tianeman square/forbidden city is 15 minutes by taxi Which should only cost the equivalent of 2 US Dollars.Hotel rate very reasonable and overall I found the hotel to be excellent value for money. Jan 26 2017	Nice	Very nice lobby, decent size rooms and beds, helpful employees. A nice perk is the tap water is drinkable and the location is central. Close walk to malls and restaurants.Also, the complimentary breakfast was exceptional.Stayed here two nights and would definitely stay here again. Dec 31 2016 	Safe Choice	Convenient location for both business and tourist. All the cab drivers know where it is. Hotel food is adequate or above average with the Japanese being the better choice. Since it is a hotel under Japanese management, showers and bathroom facilities can be on the short side and not designed for westerners. No joke! :) I did find it kind of odd since two of my business colleagues started to joke about it. Room is of decent size and clean enough. It needs a little updating. The lobby bar is of decent size and is a good place to unwind after a day of sightseeing/meetings. Nov 2 2016	Lovely thought not quite a Westerner's dream	This was my second stay in thishotel while on a tour of China.The facility is really lovely and the rooms are quite nice. As with many hotels in China, the level of English fluency is fairly thin: fine when they are first talking to you (as at chekc-in) and can speak in the standard phrases, but lost once you start asking questions. Your best bet is to keep your eyes and ears open for the ONE really good English speaker on duty at the moment -- and there usually is ONE -- and try to get him or her to handle your request.This chain is Japanese-owned, and that is apparent to a Western sensibility in small ways. You may find that a plus or a minus.The breakfast buffet is quite good. The business center staff was very helpful and competent. Porters and door attendants polite and attentive.The staff was very helpful when I wanted to buy a bottle of wine as a gift for someone in my group: they let me purchase it from the Western restaurant in the hotel, even though it was not yet opened for the day.I'm not that crazy about the location, as i like to walk around the neighborhood a bit when I'm in a city, and it doesn't feel that central. On two sides, it is hemmed in by huge elevated highways, so your walking choices are limited. though our guide claimed there was no such central area that was more commercial for walking.Overall, I was pleased with my stay there. Mar 10 2016	New Otani was a great Beijing stay	We stayed here as part of a tour group. It was the 1st city on our 2 week China trip. It's mostly a Japanese business hotel and a few tourists. The breakfast buffet was very good and they had live cooking stations as well. Lots of choices.The rooms were very clean and nice sized and quiet. The staf was very friendly, though they speak more Japanese than English. It's centrally located and about a 20 min walk to Tianimen Square. I would highly recommend staying here. Apr 29 2005	Great Location	Stayed in New Otani in April 2005. Great location. Hotel room was decent size. Part of a tour package. Room was very clean and quiet. Buffet breakfast was part of package. Breakfast was fine. Staff spoke decent English. One block away from a shopping center and the Beijing Frendship store. 10 minutes away from the Forbidden City. Expedia lists it as 2 star its closer to a 4 star. Tour stated it was 5 star. Nothing really special to make it stand out except for location. Nov 8 2014	Quality Stay	We stayed here last year and had a very comfortable stay. The rooms are very quiet and comfortable. However, the rooms are nothing fancy and are in need of updating. The breakfasts were very good and more than ample. There is a choice of two buffets, Western and Eastern. The service and staff were great and attentive and spoke English to a small extent.

"May 21 2021 	Great value Good location Nice hotel	Like everything in life it’s about the ratio between what you get and what you pay.Let’s start from the basics: I stayed on the 6th floor (business rooms) with a corporate rate of less than $100 (more like $75) including breakfast.Room was good, comfortable and clean, a desk for work very useful. Breakfast rich and tasty. Location very good, not too far from the airport and with lots of things close by (restaurants, massage, shops) service- trying hard (as much as they can understand your English), Lobby nice. Not posh but absolutely nice ,and for the price of less than $100 it’s hard to ask for more. Maybe not you’re once in a life time honey moon hotel, or a place to impress your 1M dollar customer but great for anything else!! Jan 13 2021 	Smiling Service in a good location	As someone who has stayed here for two long term stays and looks forward to more, I can only say that, for value for money, this place cannot be beaten.The rooms are large and clean and have everything that you require. A huge comfortable bed, An attentative smiling staff for whom nothing is too much touble, Tea and Coffee facilities, Free internet, TV (at least 6 English programs) and lots more, Robes , slippers etc. etc.Breakfast is plentiful and is suited for a number of different nationalities.It's not the most modern of hotels. The corridor carpets are due a renewal soon, however, I'd rather stay here than at the modern hotel nearby that has a &quot;hutch&quot; for a room at twice the price!Anyone who complains at this hotel is not a frequent traveller! May 6 2018 	good hotel	the biggest advantage of the hotel is that it is close to the airport and it is also a disadvantage as taxi drivers surely are reluctant to take you from the airport to this hotel as it is close to the hotel so that they will not earn more Dec 24 2017 	excellent value for money	I have stayed at the Huadu hotel a number of times whilst attending exhibitions at the nearby Agriculture Exhibition Centre (not all are Ag related). The most recent being Nov 2017.The hotel's location is great being in the proximity of the Lufthansa Centre, Sanlitun bar Street, the three Embassy Disitircts (including the location of the new US Embassy) and of course easy access to the airport.The English level is not that great but is better and better each time.The rooms are clean, the staff friendly.Personal biggest dislike - the lobby lounge basically does not exist. The rest of the facilities (especially the restaurants) are good. Nov 19 2017 	Good Value Hotel	I stayed at the Hua Du whilst on a business trip to Beijing, it was a short taxi ride to the International Exhibition Centre. The Deluxe room was spacious and clean with good bed linen and plenty of clean towels in the bathroom. I found the staff very helpful and smiling, if a little limited by their command of English however with patience everthing worked out well.The breakfast was mainly Chinese but with a good choice, take a tip, avoid the coffee, I have yet to find a hotel in China that serves good coffee!!There are several restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel and also a couple of small supermarkets.Overall, good value for money especially for business users. Aug 27 2017	Value for money	I stayed here in August 2017 and enjoyed my stay very much. I had a standard room this time (The business room only has a desk and chair as extra). The room was clean, quiet and the bed was very comfy. TV has all the channels you need, bathroom was clean and the bath and shower had a good water flow. Breakfast was pretty good, with a range of Chinese and Western food. I found the Japanese Restaurant across the road to be absolutely fantastic, and so cheap. I became a regular there for dinner, its upstairs above the Korean restaurant, which is good too, but I prefered the Japanese one. Huadu hotel is near Yashow clothing markets and about 15RMB by taxi to the Silk Markets, and 55RMB to the airport. Print out the Hotels name in Chinese before you get to China as no taxi drivers can read or speak English. There is a good DVD shop across the road too, they all worked when I got back home, so its OK. I will stay here if I go back to Beijing for sure, as its all you need, staff were friendly and the rate is so cheap too. I hope my thoughts help somebody. Apr 18 2017	Accomodating	The hotel offered polite service and full accomodations. The room was quite accomodating over all. Clean bedding (firm mattress), in room computer and internet access, small fridge, drinking water dispenser with water heater, robe in the closet, slippers, and tea on the table. A few simple office supplies were also provided (scissors, stapler, ruler) which came in handy on my trip. The two primary negatives were that the carpet looked quite old and was stained noticably and there was no iron provided in the room. Laundry service was available by the hotel at a very reasonable price. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and the morning breakfast included with your stay was quite excellent. I would stay here again. Oct 6 2014	Dirty rooms	Never having stayed in other Beijing hotels, I don't have any comparisons. But our room was quite dirty - the carpet was stained, the cleanliness of the sheets were questionable. It was a good size though. I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you're prepared to lower your expectations... Jul 15 2021 	?????"
"Oct 25 2021 	Excellent	Facilities are very nice, modern and clean. Beautiful view of '08 Olympic venue, particularly at night.. Superb Intercontinental hotel staff make all the difference. I was particularly pleased with the professionalism and assistance provided by the Club Lounge staff, especially the manager, Ella, and the business center staff. Their English is excellent. Club Lounge staff's knowledge of the city and time it takes to travel by taxi to various areas of the city was a great help. Aug 17 2021 	all that glitters is not gold!	big entrance thats all - not what you would expect from an intercontinental hotel. Red paint stains in room, tacky looking boxes in bathroom, room service was a disaster, had the worst spaghetti EVER there. I really could not believe that was meant to spaghetti with beef sauce, had to leave it uneaten. so called guest-relations were not there to help as we requested butler service! the only good thing is the view in the evening! And there is nothing other than the stadium around. it takes time to get taxi as well. Aug 13 2021 	best concierge services in town!	Room Amenities: The room is spacious, and so as the bathroom. The amenities in the room are nothing to criticize, nice mega Plasma TV, well-equipped executive work desk with stationery ….and more crucial is the housekeeper service, so courteous! View: as Bird Nest &amp; Water Cube are just around the corner, i.e. 5-10 mins walking distance, Beijing Contin. Beichen is the BEST choice if u wanna to explore these Olympics venues more~ nice view from my room window. Night scenic of Water Cube is so impressive!One thing needs to mention is the security system of this hotel! Each hotel guest can only access to their own floor by using the digital hotel room card when they use the lift. Location: the only drawback~ a bit far from the city centre, lets say 30 mins to downtown Wangfujing, Temple of Heaven, 20 mins to Sanlitun Street, etc~ but definitely convenient if u get on a taxi, fare is reasonable!The last thing I would like to mention here and the most remarkable thing is the best concierge services they provided in which impress me a lot. Both my friends and I are very pleased and impressed by Lolita, Anson and Adam. Three of them are very cordial, sincere, along with knowledgeable of various tourist sites and nice restaurants. Not only giving appropriate recommendation of our travel itinerary, but also patient in answering our enquiries. They are indeed very customer-oriented, more specifically, attention to details. We are very glad to meet them in Intercontinental Beichen that makes our trip more memorable. Many thanks to three of you! We’ll definitely stay here again if we visit Beijing in future! Aug 3 2021 	New World Elegance Adjacent to the Olympic Green	This hotel had the feel of a Four Seasons or similar. Very upscale, modern, elegant furnishings and first class service, with most of the very cordial and helpful staff speaking English well. The breakfast buffet can't be beat (pricey but worth it) with a wide selection of Asian and Western food of good quality. We booked through the website and the room, with breakfast was $150 per night. The room had all sorts of amenities beyond the usual bathrobes, slippers, etc. including a hot pot and french press and condoms in the bedside table. The large screen LCD tv had a good selection of English speaking stations. The bed was quite comfortable (unusual for China), lots of marble, and dark soothing color scheme. The fitness center was well equipped with a beautiful infinity pool. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants other than for breakfast. The only downside was that other than the Olympic Green across the street and the National Convention Center next door, there was nothing near by. We had to walk a ways to find a grocery store to get some snacks. NOTE: If you're attending a conference, make sure you're wanting to stay near the National Convention Center, not the Beijing International Convention Center as I was confused. The latter is a 30 minute hike across the Olympic park (which wasn't too bad and I wouldn't have wanted to stay at any of the hotels near it, the Crown Plaza adjacent to it was yuck). Jul 25 2021 	Good hotel but very bad restaurant service	We stayed in the Intercontinental Beijing Beichen for 6 nights in July 09. I was in Beijing for a conference and wanted to make some sightseeing, too. The location of the hotel is good if you want to go to the convention centers. However, if you want to go to the city it is far away, you have to change the subway at lest 2 times. We were upgraded to a king-size room with a view to the olympic stadium the bird nest. This was really nice, especially in the evening. The room is spacious, very clean and very nice, very well equipped with complementary tooth-brushes, comb, and office supplies. Nice bathroom, too. The bed is very comfy. The service at the front desk and the concierge was very good, too. They recommeded us two restaurants which were really good and exactly what we had asked for.The bar in the lobby is very nice with a good barkeeper. However, prices are ridiculous. For a small coke you pay almost 10$! What we really disliked was the Chinese restaurant &quot;Di&quot;. We had dinner there but only once since this was a very bad experience! The service was the worst I have ever had. The waitress was visibly annoyed to serve us dinner. When we ordered our menue she interrupted us and talked to other waitresses several times until we asked if we can continue our order. She had absolutely no interest in giving us a good service. On the top, prices for beverages were really ridiculous, for a small coke we paid 10$!! Food was ok, although nothing special. No wonder we were the only guests....The breakfast buffet is big with lots of Chinese food such as dumplings and Chinese pasta. It looked good, but it was more a lunch than a breakfast buffet for my taste. There is also a section with a western-style breakfast. It looks really nice but it has nothing to do with good American or European bread or orange juice. We were astonished that an intercontinental hotel did not know how to serve some American or European breakfast. It tasted bad! So although it was included in our booking we did not have breakfast there very often.For a business trip bring your own laptop. The business center is nice but internet is not complimentary, for every minute you pay 3 RMB. The connection is so slow that you need at least 10 minutes just to check your mails.However, besides these two points the hotel is good. If you do not want to eat or drink something there and you need no internet, I absolutely recommend it! Jul 18 2021 	First class hotel living up to its reputation	Modern and classy hotel not too far from the airport. Facilities we found excellent with a large double bedroom and marble bathroom. The breakfast to satisfy many cultures was second to non I have eaten in Asia. Would always return to this hotel especially if you need to travel to the airport for an early flight. May 21 2021 	A bit far from the city.	The hotel is pretty much brand new, as it only opened during the Olympics. However, it is a bit far from the action, and it takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour by subway to the city center. The room is spacious, and the bathroom got a nice bath. The flatscreen TV is nice too!!In general, if you do not mind the travelling, it is a good hotel with decent price. It is cheaper than the same quality hotel in the city centre. Apr 28 2021 	Fantastic Hotel with the best staff.	I have stayed in many hotels but this is by far the best by far. i come to China on average once every 2 months and I have tried for 2 years to find a fabulous hotel. And here it is. The staff are incredible - friendly and caring and very knowledgeable. I love staying here as I feel like it is a home away from home - something that is not easily achieved in any hotel. The rooms are large very comfortable, very attractive and as a business traveller that is essential. I not only recommend you stay here but insist on it! Although some distance from the shopping area of Wangfujing the quiet streets at night more than make up for it and it is only a 30 min cab ride to Wangfujing. There are great restaurants only 5-10 mins away. I love this place and have now ensured all my colleagues stay here. This is my 6th stay and I would not contemplate staying anywhere else. Apr 7 2021 	Totally amazing hotel - The best in the WORLD..Big statement but see for yourself	He stayed at this First Class hotel in March on a holiday through China.We read the reviews on here and decided to stay.The hotel was amazing - great facilities - awesome friendly and professional service.Food amazing - amenities amazing - the pool and spa areas first class.I have attached some pictures of the pool and also some dishes we has in the Chinese restuarant at the hotel. The Chef and staff were so helpful and the food was the best Chinese I have eaten anywhere!The rooms are very large and the bathroom is awesome.A nightly turn down service will suprise you!Make sure you say hi to &quot;Vince&quot; in the buffet area - very helpful and a great source of information.Nearly forgot - the Birds Nest and Olympic venues are across the road! Mar 12 2021 	The best hotel stay I ever had!	From the moment of the reservation up to my departure, my experience was perfect.A warm welcome whilst checking in, a very helpful concierge, great rooms with lots of space and lots of attention to the detail, great breakfast, lunch and dinner - all in all the service was overwelming and just like it should be.The hotel offers a state-of-the-art wellness and fitness center where you can easily hide after a long day of meetings.I will never ever go to another hotel while staying in Beijing! Mar 1 2021 	Hidden Gem in Beijing	Located in the Olympic Stadium area the hotel has a great feeling of space and quiet that is rare in Beijing. Its a lovely hotel, big rooms and its new. The arrival experience from the airport sets the stage for an enjoyable stay and I do recommend taking the hotel limousine. Excellent concierge, helpful staff who are eager to please. There are good dining options, rooms are excellently priced and the pianist at the lounge is great.There is not much around the hotel but the subway is a 2 minute walk and its a quick run into the main areas of town. Its a big bonus to stroll around the lovely stadium areas - try and get a room facing the arenas to enjoy the light show at night.The fitness centre and pool are superb but unfortunately it was a busy trip and I will have to try these next time. Feb 20 2021 	Amazing Hotel - Amazing Amenities - Across the road from the Birds Nest	We stayed at the Beichen for 4 nights on a trip.We were amazed at the service and amenities at the Hotel.Beds with pillow menus - soft, hard, firm, down etc.The room we had was 2 single beds (they are the size of a double bed) with an amazing bathroom and plasma TV. Large rooms with large amounts of storage and a dedicated table and chair and office supplies for a business man are a great feature.Coffee in the lounge area is an experience in its self - see the pictures.Then you have the breakfast and dinner buffet in the o2 restaurant - if you cannot find something from the vegeterian, chinese, cantonese, japanese, indian, seafood, western and amazing dessert buffet (all in one) that includes soft drinks and tea and coffee you will never be pleased!An amazing hotel with amzing service - there was snow outside around -2degrees celcius and we could swim in the indoor heated pool at 28 degrees celcius. (check the pictures out).We booked this through our travel agent with a breakfast for around $145 AUD per night - this is the best value hotel I think I have stayed in the world! Feb 14 2021 	Impeccable service	I stayed in InterContinental Beijing Beichen on Nov, December, Jan and Feb 2008 and 2021, one who travel as mush as I do, you are the difficult customer and have vary little tolerance for any think that does wrong, this hotel makes certain that nothing goes wrong, and make every attempt to make me very happy.Having traveling in and around China as well as around the world for many years. As a frequent traveler, the hotel has meets all my needs and requests during the time I stayed there. All the staffs are excellence. They are very friendly and can speak good English and they always offer me the best service to make each of my days to be the best one.The staffs make me feel that InterContinental is the second home for me. They treat me like I am a part of their family. If you are a frequent traveler like me, its great hotel, I highly recommend this hotel to you.Club InterContinental, if you like great vine and cheese like I do, check it out the service is impeccable By the way, my view of the Olympic park a green area, is spectacular, Bird Nest, Water cube, indoor stadium and the TV tower this has got to be the best view in Beijing.Steve Moreau Knorr Brake LTDField Service EngineerService Clientele675 Development DriveK7M-4W6Kingston Ontario Office 613-389-4660 Cell    613-484-5213Chinese Cell +86 15801082280Fax    613-389-8703 Dec 5 2008 	Delightful Experience!	My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Intercontinental Beijing Beichen in November 2008. Since the hotel is relatively new we could not find any reviews prior to our stay; we decided to fly blind and hoped for the best! Upon arrival we were immediately greeted by two lovely doorwomen and a bellboy helping with our luggage. Check-in was efficient and the reception offered currency exchange service - a convenient feature. The hotel is located across the Olympic site and offers a spectacular view of the Bird's Nest stadium, Water Cube, TV Tower and the surrounding neighborhoods. The whole Olympic area was heavily guarded against vandalism so we felt extremely safe the entire time. Our room on the top floor is beautifully decorated with espresso furniture (my favorite!), flat screen TV, ample closet space, comfy bed and linens, and an ultra modern bathroom with enormous shower stall. The hotel appeared to be quite deserted due to slow season and post-Olympic games. Aside from the hotel staff we only ran into no more than 5 other hotel guests! Fortunately Intercontinental didn't compromise its quality of service in all aspects; breakfast and lunch at the Cafe were well presented and decent. We enjoyed the ambience and live piano music at the lobby lounge after a hectic day of sightseeing. The Peking duck and dishes at the Chinese restaurant were scrumptious, and we felt like Royals being served by 5 waitresses since we were the only two customers. I guessed they were so bored and eager to look for something to do! Lolita at the concierge desk was very knowledgeable with arranging our daily excursions to various attractions; and our room attendants were also helpful with our requests for little things like bringing in ice (for the mini-bar), menus, etc. The one thing I would like to see improvement on is the lighting of the guest room as it turned out to be a little dark and unwelcoming. Overall, we loved the hotel a lot and would definitely return for our next visit to Beijing. I hope Intercontinental keeps up with the good work and get the words out about this lovely establishment. Nov 27 2008 	Ghost hotel?	Stayed at this hotel for my last night in Beijing after a week of business travel in China. I decided to spend some extra money to finalize my trip. When I arrived at the entrance, there was nobody to help me with my luggage or to open the door. Once I entered the hotel, I noticed there was only 1 guest in the lobby/bar. During my stay at the InterContinental Beijing Beichen I didn't see any other guests. The check-in was smooth and friendly but the bellboy clearly expected a tip for bringing the luggage to my room, something which is not standard in China. When I made a walk through the hotel, it became clear several floors were deserted, garbage laying around, dust, etc... It really felt like a ghost hotel, and so does the whole Olympic Green area. Lights are put off after 10pm (to save energy I guess) but this makes the view less attractive. I paid extra to have a view on the olympic green, but the size of the window in my room was only 1/3 of the front wall. Very weird feeling when I opened the curtains which covered the whole front wall, to find out it only had a small window! Minibar was also very expensive, 50RMB for a bottle of Evian water. The hotel only opened in August 2008, but some features in the room were already run down (I was on the 14th floor). Looking at the details/finishing of the hotel interior, I got the feeling it was constructed in a rush, which must have been the case since I visited the site two months before the games, and still a lot of work had to be done.Intercontinetal (and the Beijing government) will need to take some serious action to make the hotel and the Olympic Green area more attractive, otherwise it will end up like the Athens 2004 site. Nov 22 2008 	Love this Hotel	This is a wonderful hotel to stay if you want to be close to Olympic Park. It's walking distance to Water Cube and Bird's Nest. Night time view is wonderful and I really enjoy my stay there for 4 evening. Their breakfast and dinner buffet is one of the best. Nov 5 2021 	Top Hotel Jun 22 2021 	Fantastisches Hotel"
"Nov 17 2021	Very good location	This hotel has a great history and wonderful location. You can easily walk to the Forbidden City and Tienanmen Square. The staff was very helpful, Nov 6 2021 	Excellent location good hotel	The Jade Garden's location couldn't be better for sightseeing in central Beijing and you can easily walk to Tianenmen Square, the Forbidden City and some of the main shopping districts. We had been staying at a much larger five star hotel for work prior to moving to the Jade Garden and we definitely preferred the smaller hotel's location and more personalised service. The staff were friendly and helpful, although I would recommend trying to book a room rate that includes breakfast. Ours didn't include breakfast and we were constantly harassed during brekkie to ensure that we paid, which was rather annoying first thing in the morning! The rooms themselves were great and I could not fault them for the very good rate that we were paying. The rooms were clean and bright, the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were modern and clean. The air conditioning in Beijing hotels doesn't ever seem to get cool though, but that was feature at the other bigger hotels too. My friend ended up getting upgraded to a superior room which was really large and very well appointed, so that is definitely worth a few extra pounds. The hotel also has a very interesting history as a guesthouse during the Long March and later became a headquarters for some Communist leaders. I think it was completely redone for the Beijing Olympics and they have certainly done a good job with the revamp. The most annoying thing that happened during our stay was that we were curfewed inside the hotel during rehersals for China's National Day and 60th anniversary of the PRC. We had to stay inside the hotel for over 24 hours, which we would have preferred not to have had to do, but that was a government order rather than anything to do with the property! Besides that, we got to do all the sightseeing that we wanted and the hotel arranged for a taxi to take us out to the Great Wall too.Colleagues of mine are visiting Beijing next April and I have already recommended that they spend a few nights at the Jade Garden and I hope that they enjoy their time there as much as we did! Oct 9 2021 	Nestled near the Gardens	The service was impeccable and the room was a very good value. The location was excellent because having been in Beijing several times before we had not had the opportunity to explore this particular area. We appreciated the service. I needed to reconfirm some flights and one of the front desk personnel was kind enough to perform that service. Sep 4 2021 	Best Hotel I've had in China	I would just say that I loved this hotel. Staff were extremely helpful, and nice. The room was far better than I expected, with the large flat screen TV, and internet access. Nice big bed also, with a decent mattress. Freebie gifts like bottles of water were also welcome. I also loved how they came to clean the rooms at 3pm rather than early when I'm trying to sleep off a hangover. Bit difficult to find by taxi, since the maps I printed online were for a different place close-by. Also the pictures of the outside, don't reflect the true front of the hotel. The big sign at the top has also disappeared. But its very close to everything, and once you get one of their hotel cards showing the directions in chinese, then you'll have no problems. Ask for their tourist maps with chinese/english, since it was an excellent help to me. Jul 18 2021 	Nice hotel good location	We stayed at Jade Garden based on a recommendation from our friend who used to live and work in Beijing. We stayed in Beijing for 5 nights and wanted a hotel with a good location. Jade Garden fulfilled that. The hotel is nearby to the Forbidden City, Tienanmen Sq. Wangfujing shopping strip and night market. Restaurants also very close in walking distance.The room was clean and well presented. Flat screen television with 2 English stations, CNN and a movie channel. The bathroom was clean and had all amenities.The staff were friendly and accommodating. Umbrellas were supplied without a necessary deposit. They even delivered a fruit tray on the first night!All in all, a good stay and recommended. Jul 12 2021 	Perfect Location	This hotel is in a great location - Beijing is so vast that you could end up spending all your time on the subway or in traffic in a taxi. So to be in a hotel that is within walking distance of the Forbidden City, Tian anmen Square, Wangfui Night Market, Bei Hai park etc was just great. We had executive room which was adequate and certainly value for money. We only ate breakfast in the hotel since there were so many great restuarants close by but that was good. Would definately return. May 22 2021 	Great location for Forbidden City area!	Was in Beijing for a few days with friends. This hotel was within walking distance to the forbidden city and close to nightlife areas. The only negatiive was the restaurant. There is much better food up the street at the outdoor market! But a real find for easy access to Beijing. May 12 2021 	Double check your snack bars 	My husband and I stayed in Jade Garden Hotel for a week. It started with disappointed double bed room. The room was okay size but there are &quot;no drawers&quot; for us to put our clothes. 6 Day stayed in Jade Garden Hotel, we had to leave our clothes in our luggage. The closet was extremely small. Very stupid design for customers hanging their clothes. Maximum clothes we can hang in there...4 clothes!! Bathroom was okay but water drained so slowly from bathtub. We mentioned to front desk but not sure if they really &quot;fixed' or not. It feels like a cheap hotel bathroom. Free Internet Access : Gosh...most of times were very slow. Sometimes when we woke up in the middle of night to use PC, internet was much faster. Well, those were minor things we were not happy with. The most disappointed part was &quot;one coke&quot; was missing from our room's refrigerator. We found out on last day before we completed check out process. I told them... &quot; tell me who come to our room to drink our coke from our refrigerator&quot;. It's ridiculous !! We went to different countries and stayed in different hotel. Some expensive and some cheap hotels and never had any issues with someone drank our drink from our room. Of course, they wanted to cover Hotel reputation. They changed tone by saying...we probably forgot to fill in new one when previous guests checked out. Then, they returned my CNY 200 deposits back to us. Come on, I double checked everything at first night when we checked in. Now, at least one thing I should thank for is “they have safety box’ inside of closets and we also bring a lock to lock our luggage. For a security of personal stuff, bring a lock to lock your luggage. Never said never…!! Feb 20 2021	Excellent location clean comfortable with good service	This Hotel has an excellent location, walking distance form the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square, night food market and good shopping locations. In addition it is clean, comfortable and well managed. Furthermore it is a historic building that was completely renovated to a high standard less than 10 years ago. Its prices are competitive if not cheap and you definitely get what you pay for. It is less than 10 minutes walk from the excellent subway system and there are plenty of good restaurants to be found nearby. Staff are friendly and helpful highly recommended. Oct 18 2017 	Nice Little Hotel with a Difference (from the hotel chains).	I stayed in a standard room on level 4 @ the hotel for three nights recently as a single guest. The room was average in size but was very clean and tidy. It offered all the normal comfort and supplies you would fine in any international hotel chains. What sets it apart from the hotel chain properties is the service. Service was there before I could finish requesting it! Well, just about. The location is excellent. The price is very competitive. I must add that I am a Chinese speaking guest and I can not comment on the staff members' English proficiency. They were always ready to help neverhteless. Jul 5 2017 	Good choice in central Beijing	The Cui Ming Zhuang is a pretty good choice for hotels in Beijing. As other reviewers have said, it is in a convenient location, and the rooms are pretty nice and very clean. The staff is efficient and polite, and my requests for towels and room amenities met with rapid, polite response. My room was rather strange, in that the window overlooked the dining room, and did not give on the outside, so there was no way to get fresh air; however, the air in the summer in Beijing is not particularly fresh, anyway, so I did not perceive this as a problem.Hotels in China seem to have their air conditioning programmed so that the cooling (but not the fan) turns off sometime in the night, no matter where you have the thermostat set., Cui Ming Zhuang was no exception -- we would come back in the afternoon to a very chilly 20 deg (68 deg F) room, not change the thermostat, and by morning it would be a somewhat stuffy 25 deg (77 deg F). May 21 2017 	Decent Hotel	We stayed at this hotel on two separate occassions during a three week trip to China. For location, you cannot do better. You can actually see one of the gates (not an entrance though) to the Forbidden City from the sidewalk in front of the hotel. Tiannamen and Beihai Park are 10-15 minutes walks. One block away in the opposite direction contains great shopping and some Western restaurant options. The rooms were clean and in very good condition. HINT: ask for a room on the second floor or higher. The room on the first floor was noticeably smaller than the room on the third floor during our second stay. The first floor bathroom was also smaller and apparently traditional for Chinese guests, with no tub, a hand held shower head and a wooden grate over a drain. The third floor bathroom contained a traditional bathroom. One drawback was the limited English skills of the staff, although they were very earnest and tried very hard to provide assistance. The best English speakers were the overall hotel manager and oddly, the dayshift bellhop. Our expectations were also tempered by the understanding that we were traveling in China and English speakers are a luxury. A second drawback was the A/C units in both rooms. Neither made the rooms very cool. Both thermostats were set at the lowest setting of 15 Degrees Celsius, although the room temperature never approached this level. Also, the cleaning staff would always readjust the thermostat to 25 degrees while we were out during the day. The breakfast buffet at 68 yuan (about $9) was very decent. Except for the AC issues, overall a very good hotel. May 14 2017 	very good hotel at a very good price	I just returned from Beijing and stayed for a week at the Cui Ming Zhuang. Be aware that the hotel is also known as the Jade Garden Hotel. That´s what the sign in front of the hotel says.The location is excellent... 2 blocks from Wangfujing Street, 2 blocks from the Forbidden City.The hotel was very good. It was remodeled last year so everything is new and clean. The breakfast buffet has western and chinese food for 68 yuan per person. You can get a cheaper breakfast at a cafe about a block away if you are going towards the Forbidden City... I think it´s called Gate Cafe or Egate Cafe.The only downside to our stay was the limited English of the staff. The man at the travel counter and in the gift store spoke no English at all. Regardless, they try to be helpful and have a good attitude.They have standard rooms and suites. We reserved our room through [--] for 490 Yuan a night for a standard room. Feb 4 2021 	ien situé !"
"Nov 4 2021 	love this hotel	I've stayed at this hotel twice and I loved it each time. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet has so much variety and the chinese restaurant was great! Its very close to the silk alley market which was nice so we didnt have to get a cab. The gardens outside were great with real ducks! I would stay at this hotel again and again! Oct 11 2021 	Nicely situated hotel	The hotel is clean and well appointed. Bedrooms are fairly basic and a bit tired in need of some decoration. Check in staff were quite rude and not very helpfull. The lack of English can make communicating very difficult. The hotel has a lot of trainee staff who we found were excellent. They made the effort to use what little English they had to converse with us. Something that the other hotel staff did not even attempt. The opera is an absolute must, an excellent evening entertainment. The restaraunts in the hotel were average with the best being the Apollo but be prepared to be served lukewarm meals. The location of the hotel is quite good for those who like to do a lot of walking to take in sights. Nearest metro station a good 20 min walk but access to all major attractions could be got to from here. Oct 5 2021	Strictly average	Our tour stayed at this hotel, it was billed at 4 star, but this is not an international 4 star rating. The rooms were clean but in need of some refurbishment, especially the hall carpets were very dirty in places. Ask for a non-smoking room if this is important to you - they probably won't guarantee it though! We had rooms that had definately been smoked in and even a room that is smoke free will open onto a corridor which at times can be hazy with smoke - it seems guests go out in the corridor to smoke. Beds were comfortable but pillows hard and weighed a ton - never come across anything like it, you can get a soft pillow if you ask enough times. There was a water dispenser in the room, both hot and cold, which was very useful till on the second day when plugged into the socket (too noisy to leave on all night) it blew up and shorted out all the lights. A replacement was brought quite swiftly but it then proceeded to leak all over the floor. The air conditioning was turned off mid stay as they decided it wasn't necessary any more. Day temperatures were mid 20s and we disagreed. One member of the party managed to get a fan delivered to the room after it was found the windows had been screwed shut and could not be opened. The breakfast is quite good - nasty 'juice' but lots of bacon, eggs etc. plus local food if you like. We did not try the restaurants. The Business Centre is quite expensive for internet connection and when they decide it is time to close they just switch your connection off without warning! They were most accommodating in organising us a packed breakfast one morning when we had a 4am start - it took the chef, banqueting manager and another manager to organise it but they did a great job of a bacon sandwiches! There is a convenient supermarket across the road for soft drinks etc and the hotel's location is quite near both the famous Qianmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant in one direction and Tianmen Square in another - both about 10 minutes by taxi. Whilst English was spoken in the hotel most of the staff wore &quot;Trainee&quot; badges and they definately needed some training on customer service. Sep 7 2021 	Great Value for Money	At just $50 per night including breakfast, you really can't go wrong. Hotel is nicely decorated but not over the top, rooms and corridors are spotlessly clean, buffet breakfast is pretty standard fare but there is a decent choice between Western and Chinese food. Location is excellent with just a short cab ride to Tianmen square, Temple of Heaven and for those interested in shopping, the Pearl Market. There is also Beijing opera in the hotel if you like that sort of thing.Internet connection is quite expensive, but other than that I would have no hesitation in staying here again. Jul 24 2021	Very nice hotel pricey internet	Room spacious, nicely appointed, big soft towels, hard pillows, elegant lobby, Beijing Opera theme, with operas performed nightly (dinner/theater) in hotel theater.Bountiful breakfast served buffet style in Western restaurant and in Chinese/Western restaurant.Charge for internet is 50 Yuan (7 dollars?) for 24 hours (from 2:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.) May 2 2021 	Nice hotel	Nice hotel, but poor Chinese restaurant and expensive European restaurant. Location is good but you are still depending on taxi to get home. About 30 min walk to Tiananmen Square or temple of heaven park (incl. pearl market) Business center is expensive, 5 RMB to print one page. Internet in your room is 50 RMB each day (from 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.) Reception is helpful, specially the assistant manager. Mar 2 2021 	kanon	The hotel has a theatre inside, (but you have to pay). It has at least 4 different restautrants . Very nice rooms, friendly staff. Fresh, clean. Nov 27 2018	lovely hotel	i stayed here twice on my holiday to china with just you holidays. it was a lovely hotel, nice and clean and the staff were welcoming. had a lovely large room on the 6th floor. the room i had on the 1st stay had 2 single beds and the 2nd time we stayed i had a very large kingsize bed, if not a superking!! the rooms were both clean and functional. the bathrooms were lovely and clean with a nice selection of toiletries.the buffet breakfast was adequate but could of been hotter, this was due to the fact that people werent shutting the covers on the pans when finished with them. the freshmade omlettes were to die for. the dinners we had in the hotel were ok.the bar on the 2nd floor was lovely and the staff friendly. they did a lovely margurita!! the theatre was lovely and the beijing opera was an enjoyable few hours. i would definately stay here again and reccommend it to anyone. Aug 17 2018	Boring - but functional and clean	Qianmen is a tourist hotel, several streets/blocks away from the shopping area and what I believe is the best city of Beijing. You need to take a taxi. However, there is some shops, a McDonalds and a supermarket close by. The hotel overall is very boring, lobby area is without charm and I was really missing a nice bar spot to relax and join a cocktail or two with friends. The bar is there, but it is not welcoming you. Room with good standard equipment, clean and nothing to complain, more then its boring and the brown colors just feeling to much sometimes. Breakfast buffet nice and with several choices. I had problem to pay with my credit card upon check out, and they wasn't to helpful with this.We stayed here during a package trip to China and would never stay here again, just because I prefer a more hip and upper standard hotels - and there are several choices in Beijing for a not to much supplement. Jun 11 2018 	Good location and price-quality ratio	The hotel is strategically located and in a nice neighbourhood where you can stroll around or find a non-touristy spot for dinner. The metro stop is a good ten minutes walk but with a taxi you can reach most locations very easily. Rooms are nice, clean and spacious. Breakfast is good. On the down side service is patchy and the internet is exhorbitantly expensive.They also offer basic large hotel services like booking of tourist excursions. There is a theatre in the hotel where you can see some chinese opera or acrobatics (but we did not go). Jan 27 2018 	Hao Shie Shie Ni !	I stayed in this hotel right smack in the middle of winter January, 2018. I enjoyed my stay there. The staff were very attentive to my needs. They are always on hand to help with directions, they right down in chinese the direction for the cab driver. Evryone tries to speak english. The room was typical, clean and spacious. The breakfast buffet was laid out with a good selection of food. You can literally stuff yourself for the busy day ahead. Only drawback is the main shopping center is a cab away, a short one though. The location of Merry Mart right across is great for grocery needs. Overall, I would stay again in this hotel. Jan 13 2018	nice hotel	I stayed at this hotel in beijing only for three nights, but i can't complain. the room was clean, comfortable and a nice size compared with european rooms. the breakfast was good and the neiborhood was ok. i'd go back Dec 8 2007	* Great Hotel *	Great Hotel; very modern, lovely rooms, good food and wonderful &amp; helpful staff but English was not their strong suit. I would, however, recommend this hotel to anyone &amp; everyone. R.O., Sweden Nov 22 2007	Good hotel reasonable location atrocious food	Stayed here for 4 nights as part of a tour group. The hotel itself is lovely - sparkling clean with plenty of amenities and clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff in foyer bar, shops and reception. Visiting the gorgeous in-house theatre for the opera is an experience not to be missed.Location-wise it's ok, but would have preferred somewhere more central. You can't just nip into central Beijing from here.The real downside, however, was the food. As a tour group we were definitely second class citizens, fed in our own room with stone cold gristle, fat and rice, rice, rice. Restaurant staff were off-hand and uninterested. They seemed to want to usher us in, feed us this abominable matter and get us out again as quickly as possible.Maybe the restaurants you pay for separately are ok, but if you're thinking of going on a tour and they are using this hotel, I would seriously look at another tour operator. Nov 17 2007	Good location a bit out of the tourist zone	We stayed here for four nights and I was quite happy. Our rooms were nothing special but were clean and quiet. The building is about 50 years old and was probably an important place at one time, but no more.It seemed to me the hotel was mostly full of European tour groups (and I will never complain about rude Americans again). It is busy and the staff seem a bit challenged trying to keep all the foreigners happy, but overall they manage it, except for pleasing some of the more demanding types who don't realize they are in a different part of the world.The location is a bit out of the tourist zone in a very Chinese neighbourhood. Nothing to be afraid of just a nice regular neighbourhood with not alot there to cater specifically to tourists. Lots of shops and restaurants though.Tiananmen is a good 45 minute walk for me, but the Temple of Heaven is 20 minutes straight down the road. If you aren't a big walker take the taxi, they are cheap and will have you there in 10 minutes.Our room included the breakfast buffet which was average at best. The restaurants in the hotel were also average at best. If you are tired of Chinese food there is a McDonalds a couple of blocks away.I really have no complaints about this hotel. It is not a special place but it is good value and a nice location. You can't go wrong here if you have realistic expectations. Nov 6 2007 	nice hotel	A 3-star hotel with a 4-star feel. It's reasonably priced and clean with TV. Location wise about 50mins walk to Tiananmen Sq and a 20mins walk to the metro. Perfect for couples, tour groups (older tourists) and business. Not appropriate for single travellers who want to meet other travellers. Oct 27 2007 	Hotel tip	Nice hotel. Not to expensive. Near city-highlites Jul 21 2007 	Good tourists location in Beijing	Arrived off an early morning flight and were made very welcome, and room ready after breakfast. That's a good start! The room is good, if in need of a some detail cleaning ;-) Free internet is not free, but I'm learning that it's like that in China. Much advertising and/or internet offers don't actually match what is on offer when you get there. The location is good, we walked from the Forbidden City to the hotel one day in about 45 minutes; and walked to the Temple of Heaven about 30 minutes another day. The area seems pretty safe to wander (all of China does actually) and there was a couple of good restaurants nearby. The hotels own restaurants are above average too. Jul 2 2007 	Can recommend this hotel	Like many of the reviewers, we found this hotel lovely. There was a pleasant feel about the place, staff were friendly, fixtures &amp; fittings excellant. Good size, quality beds &amp; bathroom.The only slight downside was the Marco Polo restaurant, which served the western breakfast - we followed a large group in for an early breakfast &amp; clearly the staff had made no attempt to clear any tables. It is quite small (without any natural light) - so if you have a strict timetable to meet - be warned!We had a one meal in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel - ground floor, which was fine - but otherwise we went out. You must visit the &quot;ducK&quot; restaurant (Quanjade Roast Duck Restaurant)- its 30 mins walk - its easier &amp; certainly cooler to take a taxi for 10 Y. For a local meal, we went to one recommended by the concierge - turn right outside hotel, cross the road by pelican crossing to the other side of Yongan road (i.e. on opposite side to large supermarket) and carry on down road for about 100 m - it is the 2nd restaurant &amp; has pink tablecloths (1st restaurant does not have any tablecloths &amp; is clearly not as popular with the locals) Apr 11 2007 	Very pleased	Reasonably priced. Very nice hotel, beautiful lobby and corridors, comfortable room, clean with all amenities. We paid extra for internet in the room. Subway is about 1 km away, but city bus service to subway (#14 or 15) is frequent and will get you there if you choose not to walk. Some good local food nearby (a little place at 48-2 Beiwei Lu serves excellent porridge, breakfast/ lunch dishes, inexpensive and clean) and Weiduomei Bakery at corner of Hufang Lu and Beiwei Lu makes fresh, excellent pastries, and the cost is very low. Hotel food is decent and good, but not outstanding for the price. Feb 2 2007	Great for Group Travel	We stayed here a part of an Australian school group travelling through China and had a fantastic experience. The hotel staff were always friendly and spoke fair to good english. If they weren't sure what you were asking they always checked with someone else. The rooms were really spacious and always clean. Buffet breakfast daily was great with a wide selection available to suit everyone. Also close to restaurants which were fantastic for food and price. The supermarket across the road was good for supplies and an experience on it's own. Although not within walking distance to venues the public transport was a great experience. We always travelled in groups so weren't worried about going out to restaurants etc. at night. The staff will always write down where you want to go in chinese to give to taxis which is a big help and the hotel's card is all you have to give drivers to get home. Staff have a good idea of how much it will cost also which is good to get sorted out with the driver before you start. Taxis come to the hotel door. Hawkers in the street outside are part of the experience and will leave you alone if you say &quot;No Thank You&quot;. Local shops are fairly priced also so don't be afraid to have a look. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Beijing and would stay there again! Jul 23 2006 	Terrific hotel	My wife, 20 month old daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights on our trip to Beijing from Australia. We found the hotel rooms to be very large and extremely comfortable. When we arrived a very new looking cot had already been set up for us in the room (and was provided at no charge) which was terrific.Breakfast was buffet style and had everything you could want. There is a large, locally used, supermarket across the road where we were able to buy milk, juice, nappies etc. it was a great experience just to shop there.We were a short Taxi ride to all tourist venues. (less than 10 minutes and about 10- 12 Yuen) and could possibly have walked to most if we were without our 20 month old!! The hotel is out of the CBD in south Beijing and for us this allowed us to see more of the local Chinese then just being in a CBD area in a western hotel.All facilities were great and the staff were always very helpful.Highly recommended for tourists, and families. Jun 3 2006	Qianmen hotel was a great experience	The Qianmen hotel was located in an interesting area of Beijing. It was convenient to Tiananmen Square and the Temple of Heaven. The room was very nice and the included breakfast buffet was excellent. The staff was pleasant and helpful.The Liyuan Theatre is located in the hotel (interesting). I would recommend this hotel highly. Oct 25 2005	Great Hotel For The Price	Considering it was only US$60 a night I was pleasantly surprised. The room was tidy, the staff were great and it was an ideal place to use as a base for my travels.The staff spoke good English which helped. If I wanted a taxi the staff would go out on the street and get me one, and they would always write my destination in chinese to give to the taxi driver. I found them to be fantastic, considering how cheap the price was. Sep 8 2005	Not bad but not great. 2 star.	This hotel was a shock to us after travelling from Hong Kong and staying in five star luxury there. I will start with the positive aspects. The staff is very friendly and speaks fair to good english. The on site restaurants had a good choice of food for both breakfast and dinner, and the service there was friendly and very good. For the price the hotel charges, this may be a good property for those looking to save a little on lodging. There is no Western standard here, but this may be good for travelers whom want to escape that and feel what a local hotel in China is like. The lobby is somewhat comfortable to sit and have a drink and watch people come and go. There is a theatre and two gift shops in the lobby. This hotel appears to cater to many European travelers. As for the negative aspects, the hotel is far from any tourist interests. There is, however, a subway station near by. It was a 10-15 minute cab ride to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. One couldn't walk to much of anything. As soon as you leave the hotel property, you may be approached by street vendors trying to sell something. They are however easy to say &quot;no thank you&quot; to and will leave you alone very shortly. The area surrounding the hotel can make a traveler feel a bit apprehensive to venture out on his or her own. The area doesn’t feel that safe and seems a little poor. Simply crossing the street near the hotel, and in Beijing, can be quite a challenge, especially for those not used to traffic chaos and a seemingly free for all rush. Our room was very outdated, worn out and a little dirty. The hotel feels like it is stuck in the 60's as far as design is concerned.If we return to Beijing someday, we would certainly not stay here again Nov 5 2021	Grand luxe Sep 15 2021 	Luxe"
"Great 4-start hotel in a great location	I hand-picked this hotel for my group based on tripadvisor.com ratings and was not disappointed. Plenty of nearby shopping and close to the places you want to visit. The hotel lobby was welcoming, the breakfast was very westernized, and the rooms were upscale and clean. The hotel staff were also very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the prostitutes that hustle business in front of the hotel. If you're a male walking alone at night, expect to be approached by overly friendly women on the sidewalk -- even in very cold weather. Good location the rest average	We have spent three nights. Our room was very small, rather dated, but equipped in everything what is necessary for the 4 stars hotel. The English speaking staff is helpful and reactive.Because of the small size, the hotel is friendly and it`s easier to settle anything at the front desk. The breakfast for us was lousy and cost to much, 20 $ per person.But we can recommend for a dinner the Chinese restaurant on the ground floor, it`s realy good. The using of internet in the Business Centre is also quite expensive. The biggest advantage is location, walking distance to shopping area and many restaurants around. Nov 11 2021 	Above Average hotel	Arrived about 2pm but my room and my colleagues were'nt ready for another 40mins. As it happens this was also the same for my other colleagues I talked to who stayed there the week before. The rooms were above average but the B wing of the hotel was far away from the main reception. The room was functional although a little dark for my liking. Breakfast was good with a lot of &quot;european&quot; choice. Overall above average hotel Oct 14 2021 	Lovely Hotel I'd happily recommend to friends and colleagues	Close to the British Embassy, a large indoor market and many restaurants and bars. The hotel was fitted to a high standard and the buffet breakfast was very good. Staff were friendly and efficient throughout my stay. If I was to be 'picky', the view from my room was pretty poor, but the room itself was fine. I'd certainly stay there again. Aug 10 2021 	A nice place in Beijing near Silkmarket. Swimmingpool etc. included	We booked this hotel for 5 nights per advise of our local Guide contact, for reason of good location (next to silkmarket) and the many Hotel facilities like indoor Swimmingpool, Sauna and good breakfast/diner facilities. All in all good vallue for money.We arrived 3 times in morning at breakfast and were upgraded to &quot;french breakfast restaurant&quot; for reason of occupation in the normal restaurant (wich was already very compleet). Further more we enjoyed very much the indoor swimming pool facility, after having walked a lot on day-time doing the cultural sceneries.Would stay for sure next time here for leasure trip. Apr 3 2021 	Comfortable business stay	Being a 10-min walk from the office, the hotel served the purpose and provided all comfort needed for a business stay. My room was spacious, clean, and comfortable with dressing gowns, toiletries, a tea pot, and broadband connection. Gym is small but is open 6am – 10pm. Breakfast was probably my favourite part of the stay as it provided a wide choice of options from Chinese to Japanese and Western foods, including sushi, dumplings, and a variety of fresh fruits. Hotel lobby hosts a lovely café serving fresh loose leaf teas. The rest of the restaurants are boring and overpriced but there are a few excellent local eateries right around the corner – down the path between the hotel and Starbucks.Subway is just 4-mins walk and the Silk Market is across the road. I will stay here again for business. Jan 16 2021 	Great Location 	My husband and I stayed at the Jian Guo hotel for 1 week during our visit in Oct 2018. We absolutely LOVED the Jian Guo hotel. I have pretty high expectation for everything, and Jian Guo hotel has exceeded my expectations in everywhere. Our room feels comfortable and warm. There were so much to see in Beijing, so we were rarely in our room; but when we were there the hotel exceeded our expectations. Everything was clean, shower was hot, the sheets are comfortable....etc. The hotel staff can communicate in English fairly well. They gave us two twin beds instead of one king, but we didn't even bother asking them to switch room. It was just a minor thing to us. I am not sure what room we got (most likely the least expensive one?!), but I did notice there was internet available in the room, although we didn't bring our laptop. The location of the hotel was aboslutely PERFECT! It was in between 2 subway stations, and subway was the way to to in Beijing. So conveinent and super cheap. The hotel was also right across from the Silk Market (walking distance), which is a must go for all the shopping you can do in Beijing. We LOVED the hotel and will totally go back. We also loved Beijing, we can't wait to go back and see other parts of China. Jan 12 2021 	Good Location and Value	I spent the entire month of November at the Jianguo Hotel. I was in a non-smoking room on the third floor of Building A. While I believe the entire floor was non-smoking, the room had a residual smoke smell that I was able to dissapate by leaving with window open about six inches. The room was on the backside of the hotel and faced apartment buildings. I found the room to be clean and the maid service thorough. The bed was comfortable, though I would have liked a foam pillow option. I've stayed at five other hotels during trips to Beijing and, in my opinion, the breakfast here is by far the best of the lot. In summary, there was nothing all that outstanding or all that bad about the hotel. It was very servicable, reasonably priced and, as a result, a good value.I do disagree with the reviewer who suggested using a taxi versus taking the subway. There's no blanket solution to this issue. It depends on where you are going and the time of day you are traveling. If your destination is close to a subway stop and it's at a time of day when traffic is gridlocked, you'll arrive much quicker on the subway than in a taxi. Oct 25 2018 	Relaxing retreat in the heart of the city	We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights just before the Olympics. My company has a quite big office in Beijing and colleagues told me this is the best value hotel in all Beijing. We had asked for a garden view room - very nice and pleasant with a small terrace overlooking the fish podn and the trees in the middle of the hotel. The best thing about this hotel is that when you enter the hotel it seems a totally different world than in the streets : no more noise... Breakfast is quite average but I never had a good breakfast in China... Oct 6 2018 	Great Location and friendly staff	Oct.1-Oct. 6, 2018Just returned from one week in Beijing during their Oct. 1st National Holiday week. We were able to stay at the JianGuo Hotel for about $128US per day which included breakfast. Staff was very helpful and spoke reasonably good english. We were given a room with King bed on the Jianguo Club floor. It also included snacks and drinks in the evening however this was not explained to us on check-in. Free internet acess was also available thru use of 2 computers on the floor. Remember to get a hotel card from the front desk to show cab drivers for the ride home from shopping and dinner as none of the cab drivers we used were able to speak english. Have the front desk staff write down your destination in Chinese for the cab drivers. Twice we were taken to the wrong restaurant after the doorman had given the directions in Chinese to the cab drivers. It's best to have your destination written down including the address to also show it to the cab driver before you leave the hotel. Cabs are very inexpensive in Beijing so a mistake is not very costly. The hotel only has a breakfast buffet in the morning and it is as good as any I've found in the states. There is also Chinese and Japanese food items available with the buffet. Cost if not part of the room is about $20US so you may want to go to Starbucks.Hotel is located next to a Starbucks and underground Metro station. For the shoppers, it is also located one block from the new Silk Market where everything is for sale and you can hone your bargaining skills. You can usually get items for about 1/4th the asking price so bargain, bargain,bargain. Try walking away and staff will chase you down with a cheaper price. Many shop keepers will ask you how much you want to spend so be prepared. Many are knock offs. This is a 6 story building filled with shopping stalls.Use cabs for travel around the city as the Metro is very crowded. Both are very inexpensive. For the young and adventurist a trip on the metro is a must. Be prepared to be pushed into the car so the doors can close. Metro staff were very helpful in helping foreigners buy tickets and find their way around.Caution: Location of the hotel on tripadvisor map is incorrect. Please check another map source for the address of Jianguomenwai da jie, #5 Sep 28 2018 	Great if you get the right room	We booked this hotel on the basis of the contents of their website and the reviews we read. As such I was surprised to see the tired appearance of the room we were given on arrival. We booked an executive business room as my husband was on the back of a business trip and needed internet access(we later discovered that all rooms have internet). We also assumed that the rooms would be of a decent quality and the 2 hours of complimentary snacks and drinks every evening was also of interest (this turned out to be more depressing than happy). When we raised the subject of the room with the staff at the business wing reception they simply weren't interested. As we were booked in for 10 nights my husband was ready to book into another hotel. However, I convinced him to speak to Guest Relations first. We were shown two other available rooms in Building B which were much more akin with those on the website and we moved that evening. No more tired plastic bath, poor view and shabby carpet. The replacement room had a balcony with a not unpleasant view, was on the top floor so nice and quiet and a walk in shower big enough for 2.The hotel's location is great - 100m from the underground which is easy to use and cheap and 200m from the silk market.If you can get your room right this hotel is fine. HOwever, my biggest critisism is the higher level staff. Guest Relations acted as though we were an inconvience on the 3 occassions we spoke with them (3 different people). After a 10 night stay we weren't even wished a safe onward journey by the reception when we checked out and the travel desk will only offer tours through the company they have an agreement with. It even felt difficult to get them to call the theatre for us.The best staff i this hotel are the cleaners. In addition to doing a beautiful job of the room every day they were always friendly and polite. Would I stay here again? Possibly, but only for the hotel's great location not because there is anything special about the hotel, it's fine.If anyone from the hotel was to read this review I would recommend that they encourage their front of house staff to take a lesson in customer care.PS. The drinks in the hotel bar with bankrupt you - 1 beer and 1 coke + service charge = almost £10!!! Sep 16 2018 	This is my home in Bejing when visiting	I Have stayed here 3 times previously and staying again this October. Location is excellent and I feel safe here on my own as a solo female business traveller. Staff are friendly and helpful and I love the breakfast as its sets me up for the day. Its a buffet of european and chinese food and I usually have a combination of both.As for being unfriendly to local chinese this is never the case in my experienbce. My Chinese colleague and I stay here each visit and she finds them very friendly and professional. Location is a 5 minute walk to the pearl market and some shops and tailors on the way which are quite good. I often wake early jetlagged and go for a morning walk.Business centre is a bit pricey but the in room internet connections are excellent. Taxis are readily available from the door man and they front desk are helpful with maps, directions and suggetions of where to eat in the area. Most rooms have been renovated and are lovely modern and clean.I reccommend it as a smaller friendly hotel not a giant horrible chain where you get lost in the lobby! Aug 15 2018 	6 week stay	Having already spent a month (with two more weeks to go) in this property prior to and during the Olympics, I have had the unique opportunity to become intimately familiar with this hotel. As part of my duties managing groups of guests here for the games, I have personally inspected over 50% of the rooms and can report that the standards are high, the service personal, and the facility well located for business travelers as well as casual tourists. All rooms have been renovated and are generally clean and spacious, particularly those on the Executive level of the A tower. After their Olympic experience, the hotel staff is now even more attuned to the needs of international travelers from around the world. Their enthusiasm is also better paired with improved language skillsThe breakfast buffet is normally included in the room rate and offers a wide selection of foods, including eggs cooked to order. Their evening buffet in the Café is equally extensive. Justine’s Restaurant offers French cuisine, with attentive servers who do try to achieve French service standards. I have not had the opportunity to try the Chinese restaurant on property. Room service is reasonably priced and quickly delivered. Charlie’s Bar offers a wide range of libations and live music in the evenings, as well as food. The lobby coffee and tea service is a lovely treat.The pastry shop just outside of the front door is owned by the hotel and has the freshest baked goods around, as well as sandwiches and a small selection of ice cream. I visit on a daily basis to get my morning coffee to go.The business center is slightly expensive, but fairly well equipped. The hotel salon offers many services. (Personal note: I love the way Kevin cuts hair and will miss him when I have to leave!) The exercise room has a nice variety of equipment and a marvelous view over the courtyard gardens and pools. The indoor pool is slightly warm for my personal tastes, but is well used by guests. A sauna and steam room are located in the pool area. There is even free wireless internet access in the lobby area. As mentioned in other reviews, the Jianguo is located near the Silk Market. Let me add that the neighboring streets are lined with a wide assortment of dining options. Certainly individual tastes vary, but anyone who cannot find something to suit their needs should carry their own food from home. Explore the alleyways and you will find numerous non-tourist restaurants featuring local menus that will please your taste buds and definitely go easy on your wallet. Ordering from the picture book menus is easy to do, and yields an amazing assortment of options. Should I ever return to Beijing, I will definitely return to the Jianguo Hotel. May 27 2018 	Great Hotel Great Location	Great Hotel that is reasonably priced conveniently located on the Line 1 subway line close to Tiananmen Square, the shopping district and some good restaurants. The hotel is very clean with nice rooms overlooking a garden. It was nice to sit out on our small patio in the morning, drinking tea overlooking the garden. It gives you a nice haven outside of the city life. The restaurants are pretty good. The breakfast buffet is very good as well as a very nice French Restaurant. I wouldn't recommend their chinese restaurant, as the food wasn't so good. The staff is very helpful and accomodating. They also had tea, drinks and snacks in the lobby in the afternoon. I would definately recommend this Hotel for anyone heading to Beijing. Mar 31 2018	Decent hotel in Beijing for holiday and business.	Good location. Metro (Line 1) entrance from neighbor building. Very close to the Silk Street. Friendly service. Rooms were a bit old when I stayed there - I heard they had some renovations later.Breakfast was excellent. But dinner at the French restaurant was a big disappointment. Mar 6 2018 	Great place for foreigners centrally situated	Nice hotel, its very foreigner friendly. Internet access is very good, very fast, and fairly cheap (its filtered though). The laundry services are priced like 5 star hotels are in the US, but thats OK if you're getting it expensed.Bedroom was great. Huge bed. Great facilities, in-room.If you're going to hold business meetings in the hotel, this might not be the place to be though. They seem to be very weary of Chinese people, especially females. The host company's receptionist was meant to be my guide and she faced issues coming into the hotel, twice. Pulling &quot;foreigner clout&quot;, she managed to come in to take me for dinner once, and once we had breakfast in the hotel.Otherwise, staff are OK, there's a nice water feature, and the hotel has a great, central location. Taxis are always available. Dec 2 2007	Great Alternative Hotel in the World Trade Center Area...	Just wrapped up my 20th trip to Beijing and have stayed at hotels in all areas of the city. I stayed at this hotel about 8 years ago and wasn't overly thrilled then but gave it another try last week given all other hotels in the area had no suites left. Overall, this is a great alternative hotel choice for Beijing that, for the price makes this comparable to any other hotel.Pro's* This is a smaller hotel thus not all of the noise and lack of service that I have experienced so many times in other large hotels (namely the Hyatt and China World hotels where there are simply too many guests for the hotel to service them all). Also, very easy to get in and out of this hotel without the hassles of a massive lobby or requring a key card to use the elevator.* Recently renovated rooms. I stayed in a suite in the B wing of the hotel, bed was comfortable, room was clean and no noise at night. Pictures attached to this review.* Price - this suite was 1/2 the price of the comparable suite at any hotel in the area (China World, Kerry Centre) and I can say that the experience certainly did not reflect a lesser price.* Experience with foreigners. This hotel was absolutely full of foreigners -- americans and europeans; tourists and businessmen alike. Everyone in the hotel spoke English. Con* A smaller hotel may not appeal to some; this hotel lacks the pomp and size of the large hotels. People on this site seem enamored with the large hotels like Hyatt and China World Hotel despite the terrible service in these hotels. Nov 28 2007	Centrally Situated Hotel	We had a three night stay here during a tour and found it very good for a three night stay. The room was clean and had all you could want for a short stay including a balcony. The breakfast buffet was as good as you get anywhere. The hotel is very close to bars, restaurants and The Silk Street Market. Aug 18 2007 	Excellent Hotel in China	RoomsThe rooms in hotel wer very nicely decoratted and look just like the rooms in the pictures. I don't know what we payyed because we were on tour but it was very nicely decoratted with a great buffet breakfast. Most of the people in the hotel speak English. The bell is prompt and the it had very nice bathroom. There were robes and laundry service. The best of the hotels I stayyed in on tour while we were in CHina with Charming Holidays.We stayyed here two nights. I believe we stayyed in Room 212 in the new tower. The only complaint i have is that the beds wer hard but I found that this was true all trhough China.LocationWe had a driver but the hotel was a good location to many of our attractions. In one day we went to the Great Wall, Forbidden City, tianemen Square. Bejing seems to be going through a modernization because they are preparing for the Olympics.Extras in HotelWe did you the internet and it was nice and really fast. We got a massage for about twelve dollars in our room. My husband and I agreed that the it was the best massage that we had while we were in China and we had several. The hotel is professional, friendly, and I would recommend it to my best friend.There is a very pretty garden in the middle of each tower area. May 27 2007 	Stayed at the Jianguo a number of times	We have used the Jianguo a number of times over the last year while in town on business. It is clean, the staff are helpful, the pool is great, the lobby is a nice spot to wait for someone. My one complaint are the rooms are dark and relatively small. There are a number of good restaurants with in walking distance - the Blue Marine, a Mexican restaurant.The location is OK - still quite a distance to most attractions. For the money I think you could find better. Mar 18 2007	not a fan	I traveled to China on a study abroad with a group from my university. I had nothing to do with booking this hotel. So I take no blame! I have stayed at the Prime hotel previously in Beijing.The hotel is located on a major street right next door to a starbucks, stores and a silk market. There are no good restaurants within walking distance. It was an ok location otherwise because of its centrality. Breakfast was good but not amazing.The entrance is ok from the outside. The lobby is also average. The water garden was actually very pretty. You could see the water streaming from the lobby and it was very zen-like. There are 2 buildings 1 is the original and the 2nd a work in progress. They both share one lobby. I had to switch rooms at one point so I can comment on both buildings. 2nd building: There are noxious fumes floating thoughout the building, rooms and lobby due to said renovations. The rooms in the new building are actually very nicely decorated in asian contemporary. The bathrooms are nice with standing showers. The beds are actually very comfortable with down comforters. There is free wireless access available...but it's like watching grass grow. There are terraces with views of the water also. However, I would open the terrace door to air out the smell of fumes and in would come the scent of pollution and wood cutting since the construction was all over the place.The old building is in need of renovations. The bathrooms are moldy and old. The rooms are decorated similarly however, the furniture and linens are aging. The wireless was faster on this side. No terrace in this room.I do not recommend this hotel. Sep 18 2006 	Relaxed and Comfortable	Ex-pat friends recommended this hotel to us as I was staying on my own in Beijing whilst my husband was working elsewhere in China, and I wanted a hotel that was central, comfortable and safe. The Jinguao was all this and more. It is definately worth booking into the executive rooms on the fourth floor. You have your own check-in desk, happy hour bar and breakfast toom and excellent concierge service, away from the hustle and bustle of the main hotel lobby. The only reservation I had about the hotel, was the fact that main breakfast restaurant was very busy with coach parties.The hotel facilities were excellent. The pool was always empty and I visited the beauty salon for a manicure, pedicure, massage and a hair do - all excellent service and great value for money.Unfortunately, the excellent French restaurant 'Justines' was closed for refurbishment, but the adjacent coffee shop sold the most scrumptious cakes and pastries, which did make up for it somewhat. The hotel has a great location, close to a department store and the silk market, and is a great place to be in this ever-changing city. A few minutes walk away there are several international restaurants (Mexican, Italian etc) and I felt perfectly safe visiting them alone at night.Once my husband joined me, we upgraded our room to the split level suite, which had a balcony overlooking the hotel garden. It provided a very comfortable workspace for my husband and the most luxurious bathroom for me. An excellent hotel, which will definately our first choice in Beijing in the future. Mar 4 2006 	Good hotel at a great location parts of the hotel premise need renovation	Stayed here from 2/15-2/20 then again from 2/23-2/27. It is an older hotel but has gone under extensive renovation recently. Some rooms have the traditional beautiful Chinese garden setting. The location is unbeatable - it is right on Jianguomen Street and close to the World Trade Center, a major shopping area as well as the subway (right in front of the hotel). Very popular hotel for foreign guests.I got different rooms during my stay - be sure to request a room in Building A as all rooms on this side were recently furbished and nicely decorated (equipped with mini-bar, tea/coffee station and a nice bathroom). Many rooms in Building B are old and dingy looking, I was put in a room on Building B side for one night and had to request the room change the following morning due to its filthiness and noise. Other than this minor problem, I had a very pleasant stay. Hotel staff is professional, good room services, wonderful selection of breakfast and free in-room broadband internet access. There are many newer hotels on Jianguo Men Street/Dong Chang An Street but this one seems like it's always one of the favorite hotel for foreign guests. Wouldn't mind coming back again. Dec 3 2005	Handy and Hospitable	We stayed at this hotel for five nights and had a very pleasant experience. The hotel is rated four-star according to the local system and it certainly lived up to Western four-star standards. Our room was not huge but nicely appointed with a good sized bathroom. The bed was a comfortable king-size and the TV provided local and international channels including BBC, CNN, French, German and Italian, as well as ESPN and Star Sports. Bottled water was provided to our room each day. Staff were very freindly and helpful and spoke enough English for simple conversations and requests. Staff at reception and in the restaurant spoke more English than others. For more complicated issues, such as the location of an ATM, we found hand gestures got the message across. The entrance to the hotel was being refurbished for the 2018 Olympics but this had no effect on our stay and management provided a 50 yuan voucher for use in the hotel restaurants to compensate for any inconvenience. The hotel is located very conveniently on the main road which runs east-west through Beijing past Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. Under the building next door is a subway station only four stops from Tiananmen. The only drawback was the lack of places to eat in the district. We found a noodle restaurant and an Indian/Thai resturant but that was about it. The hotel itself has several restaurants including an excellent Chinese. May 12 2005 	Decent property good location could use a facelift	Good hotel overall. Kind of a lowrise, 9 floors maximum. It has really pretty gardens (see photos) good for people on the first floor. Nice lobby for hanging out very large with many tables, you can order drinks and food. Very good breakfast with cooked to order crepes, salad, fruit and cereal, among other things. Very good location being only a block away from the silk market. Lots of things around hotel, such as Starbucks, Mcdonalds, and Pizza Hut, also other good local restaurants as well. Check out the grocery store in the bottom floor of the Silk market. Safes in room, also coffee maker, and refrigerator which is very handy. Tianenmen square/Forbidden City on same road. Try the Subway which is half a block, it is clean and safe, costs .37 1/2 cents US and they announce stops in English. The hotel does need some work as the carpets are a little worn, but overall I was very comfortable here and would definitely stay here again. Nov 11 2021 	Normalito pero puedes ir Oct 9 2021 	???? Jan 21 2021 	?????????? Nov 5 2018 	??????????????????????????"
"Apr 30 2018 	Nice accommodation with convenient facilities	We stayed in the Jinqiao Hotel Apartments for 4 nights at the beginning of april. We made our bookings through [--] and found the service to be excellent, not only did they contacted me by phone, all the way from china to confirm my booking and to clarify some of the information I had provided, but they then immediately sent me an email confirmation including a pritnable cupon with instructions in chinese on how to get to the hotel to hand over to the taxi driver upon arrival.The hotel was very close to the train station, it was only about 5 minutes away by taxi and cost only 10 yuan. Staff at reception spoke very limited english as is the case in most of china, however within a few minutes we were given the keys to our room in the 10th foor. I believe it was room A1010 on the 10th floor.The room or should I say apartment was a very decently sized flat with an open plan kitchen/ living area and a separate bedroom with two beds. IT was equiped with TV, DVD player, Stereo and with a PC with free internet which we found most useful. The kitchen had a big fridge freezer which was grate to store beverages and other things we bought from the supermarket and it also had a washing machine that allowed us to wash clothes halfway through our stay. The decor in general was a bit over the top, while the kitchen and kitchen bar area were sleek and modern, the living spaces had a pretty awful wallpaper, but we got used to it after a few hours and focused more on the comforts of having an apartment rather than a hotel room.The ground floor was equiped with all sorts of businesses, there was a restaurant, a bar, a hair salon, a gift shop, a travel agency and a supermarket. We only used the supermarket which had a good variety of food which we found very reasonably priced. (if you do shop here, try the chocolate covered mochi with coffee centers, I loved them and was having a box a day!)Our rate included breakfast for which you get cupons for the number of nights you're booked in. I have to say though, that after having breakfast there the first day, I chose to give the following days a miss.Also worth noting is that the front desk has a currency exchange service and the GBP - Yuan exchange rate, was much better than travelex's one at the time we were there, which was a bit annoying since I had already changed all my pounds into yuans.Locationwise we found the hotel very conveniently located, only about 10 minute drive to the forbidden city, Tiananmen square and other local attractions. About 50 minutes and 100 yuan to the airport, and about 2 hrs drive to the Great Wall. Taxis usually line up right outside the hotel so hauling one is very easy. On the day we went to the great wall, we just went outside and hired one of the taxi's for the whole day for 650 yuan and the bellboy even helped translate to the taxi driver exactly what we wanted. He then took us all the way to the Wall, then to the Summer palace and then back to the Hotel and we had him from 8.30 am till 7 pm. We thought that to be pretty good value.Overall the hotel is perhaps slightly nicer than a 3 star hotel (lets say a 3 1/2 star) however all the conveniences both in the apartment and in the hotel complex made it a top pick for us to stay in Beijing. Mar 18 2017 	A little out of the way but affordable luxury in Beijing	This hotel, also variously known as the &quot;Junqiao Apartments Hotel&quot; and the &quot;Jinqiao International Garden&quot; is a little off the beaten path, but is right off the second ring road and even the cheapest rooms are roomy, modern and include a kitchen.It's a 15Y cab ride from the train station, and there are always cabs waiting outside the lobby area of the hotel. It's a bit of a trek if you want to walk to the main sights; maybe half an hour to the Temple of Heaven, longer to the Forbidden City. Cabs are cheap in Beijing, and the hotel is literally just feet away from the ring road, so getting there and away is a breeze.The building is really a high-rise apartment complex that rents out some of the apartments to travelers. There are people who live there full-time, and the rest of the units are something like a time-share. The rooms are different sizes and layouts depending on what class of room you get. We stayed in the cheapest, a &quot;Standard Suit,&quot; as they called it. It was about $65 all in, and included breakfast (for 1, $5 for an additional person). There were no suits included, but the suite was roomy, the kitchen handy, and there was even a washer/dryer.As is the case so often in China, even in Beijing, not a whole lot of English is spoken, and tasks at the front desk can take some time.There are two restaurants on the ground floor. One, where the (rather elaborate) breakfast buffet is served, and the other, which is a very odd take on a &quot;Western&quot; (as in the American old west) restaurant; cowgirls and cowboys all gussied up in their western wear and 10 gallon hats serving you an strange mix of pizzas, burritos and enchiladas. There's a bar and a pool table as well.A small grocery store is also on premises, selling basics like soda and snacks. A small pharmacy, a few shops, a travel agent, and a hair salon round out the other amenities.For us, the comfort of this place balanced out it's lack of character that one might have found in the Hutong Hotels. Having a kitchen and being able to wash clothes was great, and having 500+ square feet was also nice. We would definitely stay here again."
"Nov 22 2021	Joy City Hotel Beijing	right next to shopping complex, very convenient location! Oct 15 2021 	Room is OK service horrible	I booked my room trough latestays.com . They didnt like that I had the lowest rate possible . They let me know that when checking in by being extremely rude. Staff is very unhelpfull here. Staff does not speak english only chinese. Some speak very little english but dont actually understand a word you say. Only if you keep it very very simple they might understand you but even then usually they wont. Rooms dont get cleaned on a daily basis . Someone of the cleaning staff comes in your room and pretends to clean it. Not even your bed gets made up properly. If you can get the lowest possible rate and you have to be in this area you can stay here. Aslong as you dont minde the rude staff and except for the room you dont need anything from the hotel. I should aslo mention that the hotel is very loud . You can hear the people in the room next to you and you can hear people in the hallways making lots of noises . Oct 7 2021 	My 'HOME' away from home.	Typing this review from my hotel room as it has free internet access!!We were upgrade to a 2 Bedroom suite so you can say that our stay was great! Our suite consisted of 2 bedrooms, a hall with a kitchen (complete with electric kettle, washing machine, microwave machine, full-size fridge and a stove top cooker)! There is a 60&quot; HDTV in each bedroom and also in the hall. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms lovely. We had our 5-night stay so we REALLY made use of most of the kitchen, right down to washing our clothes for the long stay.The hotel is right next to a hugh shopping mall - Joy City Shopping Mall. That's great as we can find good and cheap food on the 6th, 7th and 8th floor. The mall has many shops which sold many good quality products of international brands.Breakfast spread was really quite good and a great way to start our day of fun and shopping!!TIP: The mall is connected to the hotel via a security door on the ground floor. You just have to swipe your hotel room card at the security detector point (on the mall side) and the door will lead you to the hotel lift lobby. Aug 4 2021 	A perfect stay	My husband and I stayed there for several nights right after Chinese new year. I asked my brother to book through http://www.ctrip.com/. The rate was 398/night, quite reasonable for standard room and we were upgraded to a business suite. The suite is modern and clean. There is a bedroom and a living room with open kitchen. I actually invited friends to come and have a cup of tea before dining out. Location is perfect, close to subway and airport bus, 5 to 10 minutes walk. There are several shopping malls around with nice restaurants. It was a perfect stay and great value for the money. Jun 29 2021 	In need of housekeeping!	I stayed there for 10 days in May. I had a large &amp; bright corner room but the place is not as clean as one would expect. Mildew around the tiles in the shower and dozens of greassy fingerprints on the door were the most obvious. I complained to reception but didn't see much difference. By the way, reception was not the most efficient except for a young german lady. It took them 2 days &amp; a lot of explanations to understand I was not checking out but only moving from a solo traveler status to part of a group.It's too bad because the nearby subway station &amp; the adjacent huge shopping mall with 3 storeys of restaurants make the location interesting. Jun 25 2021 	valuable hotel in Beijing	I booked this hotel though a china travel website. We stayed 4 nights in there. The hotel is better than our expectations. First, it upgraded as business room for double bed. The room is clean, big and good in fecilities. The services is acceptable. At least, they respond quickly to my request. The quality of breakfast is fairly good, the staff pick off the dishes as well. The kettle is dirty and carpet is dirty. Location is excellent. The bell-boy can speck English. May 14 2021 	Great intro to China	We found the staff to be very friendly, room was comfortable however more attention needs to be taken with cleaning the floors as there were black hairs everywhere. Unfortunately the bed was VERY hard something you don't need after a 20 hour flight. Great location with access to a shopping centre and ATM's via a walkway on the 6th floor. Great breakfast with heaps to choose from both western and asian style cuisine. Also, love the bar in the lobby - the barman is a gem and a pretty good snooker player.We had fun.TIP: If using the fridge in your room leave the cupboard door ajar so the heat from the motor can escape - we found it worked better that way. Jan 29 2021 	Quiet clean comfortable	My children and I enjoyed staying in this hotel over the Christmas period. The rooms were clean, warm and roomy.They had all the necesary amenities in the room. Our holiday package included breakfast. And again, my children and I enjoyed the great variety of breakfast put out by the hotel. However, the restaurant were pretty packed during breakfast and they didn't have enough waiters and waitresses to clear the tables.One thing, do not lose your room key card. A member of our tour group lost her card and had to pay RMB50 to get a new one. Jan 24 2021	NEVER AGAIN. joy city hotel	The hotel looks good, and the first inpression of the room is not bad. then you take of the shoes and you look for the slippers and you note that there are long hairs in the corridor and in the room, so you look in the toilet and in the SHOWER and there are HAIRS too.i've called 3 times the service to clean the room but the hairs were still there. about the GLASSES are dirty and if you complain, thery are cleened with a towel... not changed.if you complain at the front desk thay says that is a problem they know and offers you to change the room but will not send someone to clean the room.the laundry service is a fine.never had such a dirty room neither a such bad service. Jan 23 2021	Great location excellent stay	Stayed here 4 nights in January with our China Spree tour group. The hotel is connected to the Joy City shopping mall which was very convenient. There is an enclosed walkway from both the lobby and the 6th floor between the hotel and the mall. There are 4 ATM's on the 6th floor of the mall just beyond the hotel - this was super convenient since we arrived in China late on a Friday and would not be able to get local currency easily. The subway is about 2 blocks away, with elevated walkways over the main streets.Beautiful room: modern and clean with an excellent view. Beware, some rooms overlook or look right into the mall. Instant coffee and tea for free in the room, also 2 bottles of drinking water each day. Our room was very hot, and the thermostat did not work properly, otherwise I would give a 5 star rating. Luckily the window opens, so we could get some fresh cool air. Nov 17 2018	Quiet clean hotel after long flight!	We stayed here for 3 nights in November. Our room was extremely nice, clean - nice robe and slippers in room - also tooth brushes, shaving kit and shampoos. Adjacent to many stores and across from restaurants and more stores. Loved walking around after dinner as everything is lit up like Las Vegas. Everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful. Breakfast Buffet was great - lots of choices Any questions, i would only be too happy to answer them for you. Beijing is truly a fascinating city! Oct 28 2018	Joy at Joy City	We stayed three nights at the Joy City Hotel in Beijing with our tour group. The hotel was clean and comfortable. We asked for a room with a king sized bed and found the room to be much larger than a room with two single beds. The staff at the Joy City were curtious and professional. A buffet breakfast was served daily and was quite good (not great). Eggs cooked to order and a nice selection of western and Asian food. Plenty of room in the dining room.The hotel is also attached to a shopping mall that is accessible on the ground floor. The pool area on the sixth floor was very nice and the staff very attentive. Two bottles of complimentary water are in the room as well as a mini bar selection. Two toothbrushes, toothpaste, comb, razor, shampoo, conditioner are all included in the room. Free coffee and tea are also in the room. A kettle is provided to boil water for drinking.The bed was hard (like all beds in China) but comfortable. Pillows were great.We did not try the restaurants in the hotel other then the buffet each morning. The gift store was never open while we were there. The hotel is a short 2 minute walk to the Xi'dan shopping center. McDonalds, KFC are just around the corner and Starbucks, Dairy Queen and other eateries are located in the six story mall.The reception staff didn't acknowledge us at the counter unless we spoke up first. But, very helpful once you got thier attention. Check out takes a bit longer than other hotels as they send a person to check your room for additional charges before you leave. Sep 22 2018 	New hotel - lots to learn	I was there with work (as were many of my colleagues) and while I didn't have many issues with the room I was staying in I've heard some stories of issues!!My room was a large room with 2 single beds, a kitchenette area and a bathroom (with only shower). It was always at the right temperature and I could get 3 international channels on the telly (BBC world news, CNN and HBO movies). There was a dvd player also (but I didn't use this as I'd not taken any dvd's with me!)I had heard of rooms being too cold and that maintenance couldn't turn off the aircon at all despite numerous attempts so people were sleeping in fridges. Generally every bit of services was polite but slow. Checking out was especially tedious as they check your room while you wait to check out!!I'm not sure if it represented good value for money at all but it worked for our organisation in the most part .. I just think they have a lot to learn to speed things up and make it a better place to stay. May 17 2018 	Not really a good value!	Very friendly and helpful staff but not well organized. If you want to change money, they have to look up the rates in the internet. There are no international TV programs available. The breakfast is poor.The hotel was opend in Feb. 08 but already shows the lack of managment. The carpets are dirty, the furniture and wooden parts dispaly scratches, cables and tools of the housekeeping were spread on the floor for the whole day and no work was going on, etc. A better management would see this.I had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on and was disturbed several times in the afternoon and evening for no reason.The use of the internet in the business center ist way to expensive. 5 US$ for ten minutes!I moved on to the &quot;days inn forbidden city&quot; definitely the better choice! Aug 4 2021 	Dommage ! Jul 5 2021	schoenes Stadthotel Jun 10 2021 	???????????????"
"Oct 29 2021 	Highly recommended - what a great place!	On the recommendation of a friend, I stayed at Kelly's Courtyard for two nights after a business trip to Zhengzhou.The place is quiet, clean and comfortable. Comfortable rooms, great staff, a nice rooftop terrace for relaxing, and free wireless. Though a little hard to find for the uninitiated - have the Chinese address written out and ask locals if you are having trouble - it's well worth seeking out. When I return to Beijing, I will return to Kelly's Courtyard. Oct 18 2021 	Small 	We checked in at Kelly's courtyard in the afternoon of 16 Oct. The location is a bit hard to find but once we got inside the place we felt it was worth it. This 9-rooms accommodation is tastefully decorated, quiet and really cozy. They put jazzy ambient music on all day - which is lovely. For the bedrooms, they're rather small yet they're all clean and tidy, good enough for what we paid for. What best about this place is their hospitality! The staffs, especially Jane I must say, treated us like a family rather than hotel visitors. My partner fell ill when we first arrived so later that night I had to go up to Jane, asking for some medicine. What I'm impressed is that she took this matter very seriously. We discussed for long about the symptoms, and finally Jane decided to bring me to a pharmacy nearby, helping me in every possible way to get the right medicines (for the fact that I don't speak a word of mandarin, it's such a peace of mind to have some local assist like that) So thank you Jane! I can't thank you enough. Next time we visit Beijing, I'm sure we will meet again. Oct 17 2021 	Small 	We checked in at Kelly's courtyard in the afternoon of 16 Oct.

What a wonderful introduction to Beijing. This was a memorable place to stay and how fortunate we found it. We were welcomed at 6 o'clock in the morning by Jane who was welcoming and spoke perfect English. This was followed by meeting Sandy who was equally conversant in English, he not only looked after us daily recommending various places to visit, but also booked and arranged our onward flights to Xian and Shanghai. We spent a memorable evening with Jane, Sandy and Su(who we named) learning about their way of life enjoying their company. Thanks again to you all. Jun 25 2021 	A haven of tranquility	We stayed for a week and can only reiterate what the other reviewers have said. The helpfulness of the staff in pointing us towards the required buses and so on was a big contribution to our enjoyment of Beijing. It is a five minute walk to the main street (buses and taxis, and a subway line from Sept 2021) but that just adds to the experience. You are a bit away from the main touristy areas (thought they are easy to get to) and can get a feel for ordinary Beijing life, if that's what you want. May 4 2021 	Unexpected Oasis!	This place was obviously designed and furnished with great love, care and attention to detail. You could imagine someone who's an interior designer or architect thinking one day, &quot;I want to transform a siheyuan (courtyard house) in a hutong, blending traditional elements with modern comforts, showcasing all the great pieces of art, handicraft and furniture I've accumulated from all my travels...and I want to share this place with visitors to Beijing.&quot;The rooms surround a glass-covered, tree-shaded courtyard filled with chinoiserie, a carp-filled pond and potted plants -- it's a really nice place to take your breakfast or read. World music is sometimes played played unobtrusively. A spiral staircase leads up to a mezzanine reading-TV-internet lounge, through which you'll find the sunny roof terrace complete with deck tables and umbrellas.My room was not large but well-appointed, with a contemporary glass-walled bathroom. Like most of the other rooms, it looks and opens into the courtyard. Included in the room rate, breakfast is a simple affair -- a spread of toast, pastries, milk, yogurt and juice, with coffee and tea. But it became quite pleasant because it is taken in the courtyard, plus I thought the coffee was particularly good.The staff was really polite and gracious, but what struck me the most was their consideration for not disturbing guests. I arrived early at 8 am, and they welcomed me in hushed tones, asking me to speak softly as the other guests were not up yet. You might think this is hardly worth the mention but if you've stayed in a siheyuan (or similarly a riyadh in Morocco), you'll realise that sounds carry very easily in such confined spaces.Although located in a hutong, it's not too hard to find and a shopping hub (with shops like H&amp;M and a cineplex) is just 2 or 3 bus stops away near the Xidan subway station.The only small issue I took was the common toilet which I used on arrival at the hotel -- it was smelling pretty funky. Perhaps they hadn't cleaned it from the day before, but in any case, they should clean it more regularly. Also, laundry charges are pretty steep -- they don't actually handle it but just help you send it to a nearby laundromat. Apr 11 2021 	Small but perfectly formed!	Stayed here for five nights in April and can't recommend it highly enough. Whilst not too near the underground (though there will be one nearby soon) you can easily get around to all the major sights by bus, and the owners will helpfully point you in the right direction. Its a short walk from here to The Forbidden City and the Beihai/Houhai area.Rooms are spotlessly clean and well equipped, and the roof terrace is lovely for drinks in the afternoon/ evening.Having been to Beijing before and stopped in uninspiring five star hotels it was lovely to stay in somewhere more atmospheric with staff/ owners that genuinely care that you have a good stay. We will be back again. Mar 6 2021 	Nicer Than Home	Our family of five plus sister in law stayed at Kelly's Courtyard during the Olympics. As it is located in a hutong area, you have to walk down three alleys to get there. Until you see the front door of Kelly's you are wondering where in the world you are going as two steps past the door is a concrete wall with nowhere to go. But the place is truly charming. Highlights include a glassed-in courtyard, an outdoor deck and an upstairs lounge. &quot;John&quot; and Kelly are very friendly and very helpful. It is an easy walk to the Xidan shopping area. There are many, many buses which you can take down to the main subway line #1 (or #2 for that matter) if you don't want to make the 15 minute walk.We had done a lot of planning in advance as to how to get around Beijing to the various Olympic venues. But John always asked where we were going and usually suggested a better way to get there.We couldn't have found a better place."
"Oct 24 2021 	One of the worst hotel experiences ever	Fair warning, this review is going to run long. I checked into Kempinski Beijing with my girlfriend in late October because the price and location combination offered through Gtahotels.com was pretty good. We have had breakfast at this hotel once before and my girlfriend like it. So we expected a decent stay. However, the nightmare started as soon as we started checking in. Since the booking was done online, the front desk staff couldn't find the reservation, and we were told to comeback in a few hours. I didn't make much of this, and went off shopping with my girlfriend. When we came back later, we were given a room on the non-smoking floor (8th floor to be exact). As soon as we sat down on the bed we knew something was funny. The room seemed dated, and the carpet looked old, but the bed and everything else seemed clean. Well, not so quick. The bed literally sank! And as you run your hands on the bed, you could feel the springs popping. This is one saggy bed that has seen its day and should have been retired a long time ago. The girlfriend tried to lay down, and it sagged further. There is just no way this bed is going to do, not for any hotel, not to mention a 5 star hotel. At this point the girlfriend is starting to get agitated. I promptly called the front desk and was told all the beds in the hotels are of the same quality, but they would despatch a housekeeping staff to look into it.Upon arrival, the housekeeping staff informed us, yes, this is indeed an old bed and confirmed the rest of the hotel is going to be no better. It was clearly an attempt to dissuade us from switching rooms. She then suggested perhaps they can bring up a piece of wood board to fit underneath the mattress to reduce the sagging. I reluctantly agreed. So a few minutes later a big piece of plywood board shows up. But the board is only big enough to fit half of the bed, and it would mean one of us will still have to sleep on the sagging side. The board helped a little, but it was far from desirable. The housekeeping staff left without offering anymore help. Needless to say my girlfriend was not pleased, and it turned into a fight between us. By this time, it was already late in the night, and I wanted to be able to sleep. So on a lark, I decided to reserve another room to see if there is indeed as the hotel suggested, all the same. Of course, this meant online reservation and more waiting for the front desk to confirm. As it turned out, the hotel was fully booked, and I was given a room on the executive floor for the same price (14th floor). As soon as I waked into the room, I set down on the bed and felt an immediate difference. While not the best quality bed I have experienced, but it was firm and seemed ordinary, at least befitting a 4 star quality hotel. You can imagine I was furious at this point. I would have no qualms of paying more money for a better bed or a better room, but it took me booking another room just to find out. The staff at the hotel either didn't care, or simply lied. At this point, my girlfriend was even more upset. She called the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. The front desk manager Ms. Dun told her once again that all the beds are the same, and there should be no difference. My girlfriend demanded the manager to come up to the rooms and compared the beds for herself. Ms. Dun reluctantly showed up later, but she simply refused to even touch the bed, and continued to state that as staff, they don't sleep on the beds, so therefore there is no way for them to tell the difference. As far as she was concerned, they are all the same. My girlfriend was not going to let her off the hook, and she demanded to speak to Ms. Dun's boss. This is now almost 1am in the morning, and miraculously some lady got on the phone. She was apologetic, and she offered to cancel the reservation on the room with the bad bed, and suggested she would like to apologize in person the next day. Of course, no one contacted us the next day. Although we intended to stay for only 2 nights, I had to head back to US for business after 2 nights, and my girlfriend wanted to stay for 2 more nights. Due to the fact Gtahotels.com reservations are all pre-paid, which means I have already paid 4 nights, I thought a simply reservation change for the dates would do. But after numerous phone calls, and much discussion with the hotel front desk amounted to nothing. As part of the challenges of traveling in China, if there is changes for hotels or flights, it is incredibly difficult or frustrating because the hotels and airlines in China follow a very rigid reservation system that cannot be changed on the fly. To keep things simple, I offered to leave and pre-sign a credit charge slip with the front desk with my credit card so when my girlfriend checks out there would be no problems. All the charges would go on my name. I explained this to two different front desk managers, Mr. Dun and Barry. And I was told there will be no problems whatsoever, my girlfriend would be taken care and treated with respect.I think you can guess by now what happened next. When my girlfriend was checking out, she explained the situation to the front desk clerks. And she was told flatly no, that she would have to pay. Regardless the fact they even have the pre-authorized credit card slip with my signature on it. After back and forth for 10 minutes, the clerk yelled at her and told her &quot;you have to pay!&quot; in front of other guests. She was made to feel like a thief. Seeing she was going to be late for her flight, she stood her ground and left. Kempinski is a worldwide chain of luxury hotels and resorts, and it operates two properties in Beijing area. But this kind of rude and inconsistent service is appalling. I understand and expect lousy and subpar service from some Chinese operated hotels, but for a western company, this is utter unbelievable. I will not quibble with the equipment and hardware with a hotel if the service and attitude can make up for it. But for an older, rundown joint, this is simply acceptable. I travel to Beijing and China on a monthly basis, and have stayed in Grand Hyatt, Regent, China World, Kerry Center and the Pennisula, but none is as remotely bad as Kempinski. I wonder if the fact that I a Chinese American that has led them to treat us this way. Regardless, I will never ever stay at a Kempinski property again, and I will keep telling others this story so they will stay away as well. Oct 13 2021 	Great hotel with very friendly staff	I went to Beijing to visit a friend and to explore what Beijing has to offer.I decided to stay at the Kempinski Lufthansa Centre after my friend's recommended me this hotel.Considering the fact that it is an old hotel it still has it's charm and with the service from the staff, it's great.As I arrived to the hotel I went directly for Brunch and wow..I had so much food I almost felt sick. Food ranging from Cantonese BBQ to German traditional Bratwurst and a huge dessert buffet, I didn't know where to start. They also offer a huge breakfast buffet for those who enjoy a nice breakfast in the morning, like me. They also have a Kempi Deli, Paulaner (German food), Dragon Palace (chinese food) and a japanese restaurant..The staff were very polite and friendly, if you think that they don't speak English in China then you are wrong, atleast in this hotel. More or less all staff I ran into spoke english and if they didn't they said &quot;Just a moment pls&quot; and asked a fellow colleague to help me. Much better than the staff at Westin who were unfriendly and couldn't even smile...I mean they make an effort to help me which should be appreciated.The hotel is located close to the subway and is in a nice district. Plus if you need to do some shopping you can just go to the Lufthansa Shoppig Centre which is &quot;attached&quot; to the hotel.I stayed 5 days, 4 nights and I truely do not regret it. If you want value for your money and friendly staff with quality service then you should stay here.Highly recommended! Sep 19 2021 	Nice hotel amd good location	The room and bathroom was good but in need of some renovating. The staff spoked, for China, good English. The breakfast was ok, very busy area and hard to get a non smoking table. The location was good even tho we had a personal driver through all our stay. Close by the hotel there is a shopping mall and a couple of restaurants. Across the street you can find a subway station. Since there is a lot of business travelers the bar is a frequent meeting point which is good. Apr 16 2021 	Good hotel shame about the internet	Like a few little stones in your comfortable walking shoes that spoil a beautiful walk, there are a few things that are highly irritating about this place. Overall the Beijing Kempinski is a pretty good place to stay. the 2 bedroom we're in is spacious. The decor looks pleasant but lived in. The beds are large and comfortable, the towels large and plentiful. A definite bonus is being able to open the windows. In room dining brings great meals from the various restaurants in the complex, which up to know have always been fresh, tasty and plenty big portioned. The buffet breakfast is literally a smorgasbord of east meets west. Service is occasionally a bit patchy (after 6 times a week for 7 weeks having gone for breakfast there they still ask you wether you want to sit in the smoking or non-smoking section and that is on entering with 2 year old twins) The top floor swimmingpool, 2 gyms and the supermarket, shopping mall and various service businesses could cause you to never leave the complex. If you want to leave however, the entrance to the efficient, but busy, Beijing metro is next to the hotel or a lot of entertainment and shopping can be had within walking distance. And for a bit of fresh air the courtyard garden is lovely, nearby Chaoyang Park is a 10 minute walk for as much space one could want in a city of 14 million. Now to those stoney irritations. The internet. The hotel positions itself as great for business and leisure. Having a good broadband connection is a prerequisite for this I think. All I am getting is excuses and dial-up speeds. After the initial pause(chinese censors perhaps?) the pages take a long time to load. When running a broadband speedtest (by Ookla) I get download speeds as low as 14 KB/sec transfer rates and upload speeds that are 3 times faster??? I'm used MB's per sec so this simply unacceptable to me. The hotel keeps increasing my theoretical possible speed, in reality nothing improves.Our apartment has 3 showers, two are poky and one is over -a smallish- bath. None will let you have a shower without flooding the bathroom floor. If humankind can get astronauts into space and back easily then a leak free shower shouldn't be this hard. Apr 14 2021 	Did I miss something other reviewers didn't???	This hotel needs a renovation and is overpriced for what you get. the rooms are older, bed needs upgrading, amenities non existent Jul 25 2008 	Good Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 4 days in a king-size standard room. The room was generously large to accomodate 2 extra adult-size beds for our 2 kids. Although the hotel was not quite new, we were happy with the facilities. Every hotel staff could manage some English although we had to repeat/rephase our enquires to clarify matters. A supermarket is located within the Lufthansa Youyi Shopping City (just next to the hotel) where we could buy our daily supply of mineral water. We also liked the Korean restaurant there (next to the supermarket) as it served authentic Korean food. The hotel is also conveniently located for our sightseeing trips. Jul 2 2008 	one of the best Hotels in Beijing	During our lovely honey moon trip in China we have spent 3 days at the Kempinski Hotel Lufthansa Centre. Me and my wife have enjoyed our stay very much. Very helpful and friendly employees, nice atmosphere, cozy apartment and excellent food!We could highly recommend the hotel restaurant - Dragon Palace, were we have experienced a very tasty trdaitional food and wine for competitive price, accomponied by the traditional chinese music. Quite interesting was to try original German food and beer at the Paulaner bar. Sitting outside in the garden, drinking very good beer after a tasteful meal we almost felt like beeing at some &quot;Biergarten&quot; in Germany :)The breakfast buffet at Kranzler Restaurant had big choice of international and local dishes.The staff of the hotel made us feeling like VIP guests, helped us with anything they could do and made our stay unforgetable. For business or vacation we do recommend this hotel to anyone who goes to Beijing and we will for sure come back again! Jun 15 2008 	Bad location good staff good kitchen	Furniture is old, the first 5***** in Beijing for all that!  Good breakfast, good restaurants in the hotel building and good, not so expensive on the streets around the hotel. Good staff, very good staff – rooms, business, mail, to change room – no problems. Personal is from Germany, Holland, England. Very competent Chinese staff! Toll (2 m) door – keeper, very pleasant! Very bad location – 10-15 minutes by taxi to the center, 30-40 RMB. But 30 minutes to airport.   There was like a city in the city. There was music in the bath room.TRIPLOVEJOY Mar 17 2008 	Closest to Airport Good amenities Beautiful lobby	I arrived the Kempinski around 3pm, after a short 15-20 minute (55RMB) ride from the airport. Perfect since I was only staying there for a oine night layover.Was greeted at the entrance by the bellman, who took care of my luggage. Check-in was quick and the staff was friendly. The bellman immediately accompanied me to my room (947) and explained to me the various facilities on the way.My room was on the ninth floor with a view to the south (nothing really to see.. mostly construction). The room was very spacious and has a desk. The furniture felt new and clean. There is a good selection on TV channels (10 Chinese, 20 International incl. CNN, TV5, ESPN...).I walked around to the Lufthansa Shopping Center, which really is a department store (not a shopping mall). The store carries mostly European and US brands (Armani, Ralph Lauren, Nike...) so that was a disappointment for me..The swimming pool is located on the 18th floor, nice swimming pool but the locker and shower facilities could use a renovation. AGain, the staff was very polite.The hotel offers 24-hr room service. The meals I ordered arrived after 30min and were excellent. The next morning, the breakfast in the Kranzer restaurant was excellent. They carried a mi of western (eggs, bacon, fruit) and asian (dim sum, congee...). The price for breakfast was around 250RMB&lt; which is very expensive in my mind, but the excellent food made it worth it.Overall, the hotel is very well run. Staff is friendly and speaks english very well (relative to the general chinese). The room was spacious, and the bed was equipped with a control for all the lioghting of the room (great night light below the bed). The hotel offered complimentary water bottles too, which was a nice addition. My only recommendatoion would be for the swimming pool facilities to be renovated. Mar 16 2008 	Disappointing	I have stayed in many hotels in Beijing and this is my first disappointment in a long time. I picked it mostly because it was convenient for what I had to do (not convenient for tourists).This hotel is not 5-star. Probably 4. It underdelivers for the price. I previously stayed at the Hilton in this part of town and it was much better. Essentially this hotel is old and doesn't offer what you expect from a 5-star hotel today. Old bathroom, inadequate towels and pillows, uncomfortable bed and very average food.I had much better experiences at the Inter-Continental or Westin on Financial Street for half the price. Jan 23 2008 	Very convenient and a good place to stay for business	When I am in Beijing I normaly stay in this hotel. It is only 30 minutes away from the airport and also close to our offices (I am normally here on business).The rooms are very clean and spacious and well equipped. For me the beds are a little too soft. Service is welcomming and I like the different restaurants in the hotel as I like to eat in the hotel when I am travelling. I can recommend the Bavarian restaurant as well as the Italian restaurant. Also the breakfast is good, wide selection and good quality. It is not cheap but a convenient place to stay.I would like to see WLAN in there, it is a bit inconvenient not to have it.Overall I will return to this place. Nov 25 2007 	Good Hotel - Though I Expected More	I found the Kempinski to be a good hotel. Very good facilities with a shopping centre next door. The choice of restaurants in the hotel is excellent and caters for every taste. Staff is friendly a efficient. However the room itself was a bit disappointing for a hotel that calls itself a 5 star property. Rather run down with outdated decor and in visible need for renovation. This was a surprise to me for a hotel in asia that usually offer very high quality. Never-the-less due to the otherwise good quality and it's very convenient location to the airport and many corporations I would probably stay here again. Oct 29 2007 	Nice but noisy	Stayed only for an overnight. Location was great due to the nearby restaurant/brewery/biergarten. Room was comfortable but the construction noise/vibration due to &quot;renovation&quot; was a disturbance. Temporary lobby is very small and crowded but staff was friendly. Concierge was very helpful. Once the renovation is complete, I think this would be a pleasant place to stay while visiting the city. Oct 15 2007 	Excellent Hotel	We stayed at the Kempinski Hotel September 12-14, 2007.The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful. Most had a very good knowledge of English. The concierge was most helpful in recommending restauraunts in the area within walking distance.The breakfast buffet each morning was the BEST we have ever experienced. The variety of food was remarkable. It was so good that I made it a point to personnaly thank the food service manager AND write a letter to the hotel manager.You cannot go wrong staying at the Kempinski Hotel. A shopping center is connected to the hotel with a super market in the lower level for extra bottled water and snacks. Aug 30 2007 	Solid hotel well located	I went to the Kempinski on a business trip and found a conveniently located hotel, with nice and well-equiped rooms and friendly professional service. It has three restaurants in the property (so you can choose between italian, german and chinese and international food). So if you are not a fan of new flavors (as myself) you can find your all-time favourites here. The area is surrounded by embassies, and the Hard Rock Cafe is one block away. It is close (relatively, nothing is too close in Beijing!) to some of the city's best known attractions and markets. Taxis are available at all times and the bell boys can translate to the drivers your destination. It is close to the airport (15 minutes cab ride). The rooms are of adequate size and have the amenities for hotels of this category. The hotel has a swimming pool where you can relax enjoying a nice view of the City. Breakfast is very complete, with local and international food. Aug 1 2007 	Solid international hotel	I stayed in this hotel several times over the last two years and never had any reason to complain. Service is professional and almost everybody manages a few words in English. Those at the front desk speak it fluently, so you will always find help when you need it. The breakfast buffet is splendid. I do not understand the complaint of the first reviewer about it. I know the breakfast from many 5* hotels and this one is one of the best of them all - if not the best. The Paulaner beergarden brews its own German-style beer on site and is a great feature for German travellers (such as myself) longing for something familiar, even if the Chinese waitresses in their Bavarian dresses look more weird than familiar. On the downside, the rooms are nothing special and somewhat small. In the lobby you will find nowhere to sit except some stone benches around the potted palms. The location, on the third ring road and close to the airport, is convenient for business travellers, but a bit out of the way for tourists. In heavy traffic - that is, almost always - it can take 45 minutes or even more to get to Tiananmen. This might improve when they open the new subway line right outside the hotel next year. For me, transportation is no issue since my company's local office is located across the street. If it was not for this, I might try another of the now manifold options in Beijing, but I will happily return to this one on all future trips. Jun 24 2007 	Not what you expect from a 5*......	I stay a lot in Kempinski hotels in Asia and Europe. Just arriving from another Kempinski in the Middle East here in Beijing I have to say the contrast could not be any bigger. Although the overall quality is still OK, the rooms need a refurbishment in the next time. Yes, they are clean, but you have to wait until 5 PM for the cleaner to begin the work. There is no shower in the very small bathroom and you have to stand in the bath tub, behind a plastic curtain. There is a cooker for hot water/ coffee next to the TOILET. The Aircon works, but smells funny sometimes (if it was turned off for a while) The staff is aways willing to help, but sometimes it feels like they are still learning their job. After all, this feels all a bit run down and more 3..4 stars as like a 5 star with under the Kempinski management -which is normally excellent. Unfortunately the price feels 5 star... Jun 22 2007 	My favorite in Beijing	The Kempinski Hotel is my favorite hotel in Beijing. It's very comfortable, the location is good, and the other retaurants and stores in the hotel and connected lufthansa complex are great. It's the best place to be when the weather and air in Beijing is bad and you don't want to go outside. The service at the Kempinski is good -- even if there is a problem. I recently was given the wrong room and they corrected it promptly (incidentally -- the rooms with 2 beds are NOT good -- the beds are very small singles. In contrast the king-sized beds are GREAT).Don't miss the deli or the wines selection in the lufthansa center grocery store (basement level). Apr 7 2007	Nice Business Hotel Dec 16 2006 	A pleasurable return Sep 24 2006 	Good location for Beijing Aug 14 2006 	Excellent Choice in Beijing Apr 25 2006	A solid option Mar 19 2006 	A Real 5-Star Hotel May 29 2005	Not up to 5 star standard Sep 4 2021 	Ausgezeichnetes Hotel guter Service Jul 24 2021 	Hôtel très correct Mar 26 2008 	Germany meets China"
"Mar 15 2021 	Utter bliss in the big city	From the moment we set foot in this little gem, we were treated like royalty. From the elegant lobby to the plush rooms, everything was warm and welcoming. Great beds, beautiful decorations, great bathrooms. Breakfast buffet had something for everyone. Our only negative was the coffee in the 2nd floor breakfast room; even at opening at 6am it was bitter and tasted like it'd been cooking all night. The workout rooms, pool, and two hot tubs are awesome. Lots to do in the neighborhood; great hot pot restaurant close by. Tao Temple/Cultural Center across the street, open to the public. Stop by Yashow Market a few blocks away; much better than the Silk Market, less pushy sales people, and better prices. Oct 22 2018 	No better than last time	I once again stayed for the weekend and unfortunately the Hotel has dropped even further. From the moment we booked in and the reception asked if we wanted seperate rooms-even though this time I booked as Mr and Mrs beerfreind-the reception was cold and uninviting.The room - on executive floor was clean and comfortable. Room service banging on our door at 8.45 wanting to clean was not appreciated on any of the three mornings. The breakfast was average and cold. We stayed at Raffles on our previous visit and after this last effort we will return to Raffles in the future. Sad that a hotel could fall this far from grace May 20 2018	Better than Beijing Holiday Inns	This review is based on 5 or 6 stays at this hotel.Fine, polished (literally) lobby. Check in service is slow, writing details down manually.The best aspect of this hotel is the rooms, which are very comfortable including high quality bedding, good climate control, and fine bathrooms with excellent showers, baths and soft towels.The rooms are not completely soundproofed so if you're noise sensitive, ask for a quieter room, perhaps on a higher floor. There is some street noise outside from traffic.The coffee shop buffet at breakfast is very good (except for the coffee: so-so), but I recommend going out rather than eating the dinner buffet which is mediocre.As is usual in China, the hotel only distributes poor quality state run newspapers, but you can get real news via fast free internet connection in every room.The hotel is 15 mins. walk or 5 mins. taxi ride from Sanlitun, an evening entertainment area with a series of bars featuring live bands, some from the Philippines.All in all, this is a reasonable and comfortable hotel for a short stay in Beijing, and better than some of the branded chains. May 19 2018 	Five star room three star service two star food	This is a nice new modern hotel and the rooms are really comfortable and nice. However, they food is dreadful. I ordered a chicken dish for room service and they brought up something that was 3/4 hot peppers and 1/4 tiny chicken pieces wrapped around bones. I've eaten plenty of Chinese food so my problems weren't cultural. When I complained I was told that I just didn't like Chinese food. I asked for something else and they brought it up. But, they expected me to pay for the bad chicken dish. I complained that I shouldn't have to pay. The women said she would check with her manager. She called a little while later to say that &quot;just this time&quot; they would make an exception and I wouldn't have to pay. I was made to feel as if I was some crazy westerner. This is not what one expects in a five star hotel. The Internet connection here is also extraordinarily slow. I need a fast connection for work so I had to go to a nearby Internet cafe. If they could bring the service and the food up to the standards of the rooms this would be a nice hotel. For now, I say stay at the nearby Sheraton. May 5 2018 	OK hotel with good sized rooms but food 	I stayed at the KunTai on business and thought my room was really good; very spacious and clean with all mod cons. The things that didn't really impress me though were the food which was really quite mixed i.e. some things were delicious and others inedible and the Spa where I got an awful massage that left me quite uncomfortably sore for a few days. The hotel is really well located though for most things so as long as you avoid the Spa and eat out where possible it probably is not a dreadful choice for visiting Beijing. It is worth noting it isn't remotely 'authentic' though (just like any western chain hotel really) so if you were on holiday and wanted something a bit more 'Chinese' I wouldn't recommend it. Dec 29 2017 	Good	Stayed here 11 days on business.The basics here are very good: very spacious room, clean, comfortable bed, and excellent soundproofing between rooms. The bathroom was large and excellent, finished entirely in marble.The pool is very nice, but be sure to bring a bathing cap (you can buy one there, but it is very overpriced).Within a few minutes' walk are numerous restaurants, several ATMs (plus one in the lobby), a large supermarket, a Starbucks, and a clothing bazaar. The Forbidden City area is about 10 minutes West by taxi (or about 45 minutes by foot).One serious problem: the (free, wired) internet connection worked OK for Chinese sites, but varied from slow to useless for US sites. The problem appears to be with the hotel's choice of ISP, as I had no such problems from the office building across the street. There is a internet cafe one block east (I did not try it).Quibbles: most of the furniture seems to have been designed for a much smaller room. Given the size of the room, a larger desk/work area would have been appreciated. The electrical outlets are too few and too artfully hidden. My room was too hot, and the thermostat temperature setting and heat/cool switch don't do anything -- only on/off actually does what it says. You can open the window, but with Beijing pollution that isn't ideal. The plumbing fixtures look nice, but are not of the highest quality -- I had to request maintenance on them several times. Nov 30 2017 	Nice but room too hot	Very nice hotel, good beds and a nice buffet breakfast. My only complaint was that the air conditioning was not working, and it was too hot in the room. Fortunately the window would open, and it was fall so I could get some cool air into the room.Breakfast buffet had a good selection of Asian and Western dishes. The menu for dinner seems to have a lot of &quot;fusion dishes&quot; on it, food was good, but don't expect Chinese food here. You could listen to the TV in the bathroom, and you could control the volume. The bathroom was very luxuriously, and everything worked flawlessly. The wired Internet worked well and was very easy to get into. No extra charge for it. Landry was quick, cost was reasonable, and my clothes came back in good condition. Room safe is large enough for a laptop computer. Excellent chocolates in the downstairs lobby.Entire floors are non-smoking. Feb 24 2017	Good spot in Beijing	I was in Beijing for business and spent two weeks at the Kuntai Royal Hotel. It was chosen for me by my employer, but I had no complaints, especially once I discovered the breakfast buffet on the second floor, which as far as I could tell was complimentary with my room. I'm not sure if a special business rate was negotiated, but the final bill was surprisingly low for such a nice property. My only complaint was the temperature control, which mostly didn't work. I spent most of the nights with the thermostat turned way down, both windows as wide as they would go, and was still too hot. The &quot;fancy&quot; restaurant was disappointing, but the dinner buffet was reasonable, and one of the beverage options is refillable beer. Good free internet service, and the laundry service was not too expensive either. Nov 12 2016 	Convenient Location	Good:- The hotel is new.- Free internet.- Location is good. for shopping. A large grocery (name is WONDERFUL) is a one-minute walk away. There is a fashion mall diagonally across the hotel, and silk street bazaar is abour 3-5 minutes drive from the hotel. Easy to catch a taxi in this area, and if youre feeling adventurous, there are many buses that pass infront of the hotel as well. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel.- Breakfast is plentiful. Buffet choice of congee, wonton noodles, dimsum, fresh juices, cereals, cold cuts, fresh fruits, rice, sausages, eggs any way you want, etc etc etc. , although they serve the same things everday...- Staff is very helpful. Most can understand and speak English. - Bathroom is roomy - separate shower and bath areas. Enjoyed the bath tub. Hotel provides usual toiletries - soap, shampoo, bath gel, lotion, toothbrush, shower cap. Usual generic hotel toiletries. No bath salts or bubble bath.-Very helpful staff at the business center who helped me compose a letter in chinese.- Room not so big by asian standards. Not so good:- There are only three (3) non-smoking floors in the hotel. We were given a smoking room. Not happy with that. And the room was fully booked when we arrived due to some conference being held at the hotelso they couldnt transfer us to a non-smoking room. Good thing the room had windows. We left them open during our entire stay. - Electricity acting funny. Our lights suddenly went off in the middle of the night, probably due to some short circuit. Staff was able to fix it in 20 mins after we reported it in the morning. However some of the lamps continued to be unpredictable. Some wouldnt turn on at times. Strange.Overall had an enjoyable stay. Oct 27 2016 	Great Service 	I was genuinely surprised at the modern, spacious &amp; clean room. The room was made more than twice a day on some days. Hotel staffs were also extremely helpful and efficient. Most of them spoke English. The location was great too. A short walking distance (5 min) to a train station, a huge supermarket was 2 buildings away, one fashion shopping mall diagonally across the road (I think the mall's name was &quot;Yueshow&quot; Mall. Similar to &quot;Silk Market&quot;, but I found this one much cleaner, and more relaxing to shop as not as crowded!). There were also few other shopping malls around the hotel, including an upper-end mall with starbucks cafe. Sep 21 2016	Quite Nice	well, it's worth it. I would recomment to everyone. Most of the staff are nice and friendly.The HEALTH SPA area is quite nice and you could even ask for a massage lady to your room. You should try it Jul 18 2016 	Great hot in a great area	Great new hotel in an great area with lots to offer. I stayed there 10 days and loved it. Excellent service, perfectly clean, very comfortable beds, outstanding pool/gym... I only wish more of the staff spoke english. There is a latin bar/lounge arround the corner, &quot;Mojito&quot; that's very convenient ;) Jun 27 2016	it was perfect....	My friend and I stayed at the Kuntai for only one night at the end of May. I had booked online for a double room for approx $125CAD. Every experience with this place was fantastic. The porters and the clerks were quick, thoughtful and most importantly fluent in English. When you want to leave the hotel, there is already a line of taxi's waiting on the street. The concierge waves one over for you and translates for you where you want to go. (The silk alley - now relocated to one single building of super shopping fun, and the friendship store was only 10RMB away.)Our room was not small; however, with all the furniture in the room, which included a desk, a large armchair and the whole t.v/fridge/storage unit, the space was a little tight. Still, the linens were all crispy clean, pillows were balanced and fluffy, bathrobes were white and new. (Air conditioning was in good working order and it was quiet and comfortable.) The bathroom on the other hand was enourmous. The shower stall and the giant bathtub were separate. The decor and the dimming lights gives the right atmosphere for a relaxing soak. There were plenty of heavy towels and little knick knacks of shampoo, lotions, toothbrushes etc.. Of course, being a relatively new hotel, everything was also very clean; no sweaty pipes, moldy grout, or stained porcelin. I would recommend this hotel to everyone... Mar 22 2016	Nice new hotel Great bed and bathroom	Beatiful new, modern hotel. Very nice bathrooms and linens. Super comfortable bed. The room we were given (1123) was on the small size for Chinese hotel rooms. The size was comparable to an NYC room. The breakfast was ok, nothing spectacular. Business center computers are not in private rooms or cubbies. Location is convenient. Jan 25 2016	Good new adress in Beijing	This is a brand-new 5-star-rated hotel that is located very conveniently within the inner ring road, close to Worker's stadium and Sanlitun Lu. Subway is a 5 minute-walk away. Two fake markets, KFC... are opposite the street.Rooms are large (&gt; 40 sqm), well decorated and all of them have the same size. Very comfortable beds, marble bathroom with separate shower and tub. Few English TV channels.Try out the Spa, you'll find probably one of the biggest indoor pools in Beijing.We only tried the breakfast, which was standard Western &amp; little Chinese. Nothing special, but also nothing to complain about.Nice bar, but expensive."
"Nov 18 2021 	OK hotel past it's prime	The hotel seems fairly old and could do with some renovation. The rooms are clean and reasonable size. Although a serviced apartment with a kitchen there was no crockery or pots and pans. Location is good - 10 mins walk from nearest subway station and 5 mins to central shopping area and 20mins to Forbidden City Sep 21 2021 	Loved it!!	We (3 friends) stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and thought it was fantastic. The apartment was nicely furnished and very clean. The location was excellent, well situated to Wanfujing area, markets, and restaurants and easy taxi ride to all sights. The staff were great. The pool and restaurant were also excellent. I would easily stay here again and recommend it to friends. Aug 23 2021 	Happy Days- All Good	My wife and I spent 4 nights at Lee Gardens and had a fantastic time. The location was fantastic being very close to the main pedestrian areas downtown and also close to the subway. Th rooms were very tidy and fully self contained. Best of all the staff were brilliant. If we were to return to Beijing we will be staying at Lee Gardens. Aug 19 2021 	Great Option in Beijing for Families and Excellent Value	Stayed at Lee Garden for a week in the summer. The location is right in the Wanfujing area which makes it very convenient to hit the key spots around the locale. Rooms were well portioned like a comfortable apartment and it's great to have a quasi-home to come back to with a separate living area, dining table, kitchen, washer/dryer, etc. all within the apartment after a long day.The staff was helpful, especially the guys manning the doorway to get cabs for you. There's a convenience store around the corner to stock up on drinks, food, snacks, etc. And the dining options are abundent in the whole Wangfujing area. You can walk to the Forbidden City's east gate entrance fairly easily.Fantastic value for a 2-bedroom unit especially when compared to getting 2 rooms in a regular hotel in the same area. Would definitely stay again. Would recommend shopping around various travel sites and contacting the hotel/apartment directly to get the best quotes. The quotes we got were significantly different between Expedia, ctrip, etc. Oct 8 2018 	A Good Property - Certainly Worth Considering	I stayed here during the Olympic/Paralympic periods and was quite pleased. It’s about a 4-star property, the staff are very nice and accommodating and the hotel’s location is fantastic.I stayed in the studio apartment and was comfortable enough (the beds are terribly firm, but this is quite common in China). The kitchen was tiny, but had everything I needed; the washer/dryer was puzzling at first, but easy to use after the first try; and the internet connection was fairly strong. I was staying for about five weeks and found the closet area a bit cramped and poorly designed (or perhaps the room was poorly arranged because one of the closet doors swung open into the couch). For the most part, it’s a clean hotel, but the carpet is my room was quite stained, so it gives the room a certain worn look.Some colleagues were staying at the same property as me and some of them had one, two and even three-bedroom apartments. These are much more spacious and well-kept it seems. If you are considering the studio, I recommend looking into the cost of the one-bedroom.The hotel gym is very good – lots of equipment to choose from. There are yoga/pilates classes and a pool, too.As mentioned, the location is excellent. Lee Gardens is just steps from the Wangfujing area – AMP Mall is a block away and Oriental Plaza is about a 7 minute walk. There are several high-end five-star properties in this area (Peninsula, Regent, Legendale), as well. It’s a pretty dynamic area of Beijing, there are plenty of places to eat and shop – I certainly recommend the fifth and sixth floors at AMP.Overall, Lee Gardens Service Apartment Beijing is a good choice for the business traveller or vacationer who is looking for a cheaper, yet more spacious alternative to the typical 4-star accommodation – without having to sacrifice location, amenities or comfort. May 17 2018 	Good but has some weaknesses.	This is not really a hotel but a &quot;serviced apartment.&quot; Some people stay for a short time but others live there for months or years. I staid here for one month. On the whole it was good but I am not sure if it is the best value that you can get.It is clean and its rooms are of course more typical of an apartment than a hotel. They are equipped with full kitchens and laundry machines. The bathrooms are large and elegant. The location is excellent. It is in Wangfujing, one of the major shopping areas of Beijing and close to shopping and the subway. I also liked their cafe in the basement which gives pretty good food for reasonable prices.The service while good, however, is not quite what it would be at a hotel with a smilar price. They clean your room twice a week instead of everyday if you sign a monthly lease. And it does not have some of the other minor perks that many hotels in China will give you (free bottled water, money changing etc).The apartment was generally in good condition but there were minor problems. My bathroom sink could never deliver hot water and did not drain properly. My washer/dryer machine needed to be replaced because its drying function did not work properly. Even the new machine could only handle small loads and took hours to finish them.If you are staying in Beijing for a while it is probably possible to get an equally nice apartment without twice weakly maid service for a much lower cost. If you are staying for a short time and don't need a larger apartment you might be better off staying at a similarly priced hotel like Holiday Inn Downtown Beijing.But still, I can't really complain too much about my stay here. It was convenient and satisfying if not spectacular. Jun 14 2017 	Serviced Apartment close to Beijing sites	I was a little apprehensive to stay here after i saw some of the past reviews about the place being dirty,etc. We traveled with our eight month old son and really needed to stay in a serviced apartment, for the kitchen and extra space. I have to say we had a wonderful time. I am so glad we stayed here. The reception staff were a bit cold and reserved, but the doorman was extra friendly and helpful. We stayed in an one bedroom apartment for five nights, which was really nice. I asked in advance from the reception staff for pots, pans,etc(since they don't seem to keep them standard in the apartment-you have to ask) and used them for my son's food and sterlizing bottles. Our bedroom was very comfy. The bathroom had a shower and soaking tub. The apartment was very clean. I was really worried about this, since my son is crawling, but the carpets were fine. We didn't have breakfast at the property, since we found it pretty expensive. Instead we went to Oriental Plaza (about 10 minute walk) to the grocery store at the bottom of the building and bought groceries. We found that buying groceries at a top of the line(expat) grocery store was cheaper than having breakfast at the hotel. There is a nice business centre on the bottom level. Our room came with a washing machine/dryer which was really helpful during our stay, even though you can get laundry done through the hotel directly. The hotel is close to many attractions. I highly recommend this hotel for business travelers and families. Word of warning, the city is under reconstrution due to the olympics. This wasn't a problem for us during our stay, but there is a construction site on one side of the building. Dec 3 2016 	Great value and location very pleased !	Stayed here for 5 nights in November in the one bedroom apartment. The apartment was very spacious, clean (maid service every day) and had good facilities (including internet, gym, pool and a restaurant). I had been unsure whether to try this place or the Tianlun Dynasty hotel which is a few minutes away. I am glad I chose the apartment as it was excellent value being £20 per night cheaper than the hotel for an apartment as opposed to just a room, and is in my opinion in a slightly better location.All staff were courteous and helpful. They assisted us each day with directions and writing down in Chinese the names of places we wanted to go to, so we could give the info to taxi drivers. The location for me was excellent. The shops of Wanfujing are minutes away and so is the Donganmen night food market. The restaurant within the apartment was good but there are also plenty of other good options nearby (esp recommend the food hall in the Oriental Plaza mall). If I go to Beijing again I will definitely stay here and would not hesitate to recommend this place. Jul 28 2016 	Great Location Friendly Staff	We stayed there for a week with another family. Because we have so many children among us, I find the idea of a service apartment an excellent alternative to a hotel, especially since we paid no more, if not less than another hotel inthe area.Location is excellent, it is 3 minutes away from a western-style shopping mall where you can get all kinds of food, some even delivered to the hotel 24/7. McDonalds is also located in the same mall so our children are just happy to have some familiar food for breakfast for the first day. As a result, we never tried breakfast in the hotel.The rooms are very big, even by North American standard. Our one-bedroom apartment is more than 1000 sq ft. My friend's 3-bedroom looks like a maze, with full size mud-room, walk-in closets and everything.Air conditioning is at the right temp. We were in Beijing in the last week of June and it was very hot outside and most malls and taxis do not have good air-conditioning. So it is always nice to walk into the hotel lobby and feel the cool air on you. Not cold, just refreshingly cool.Staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. There is always some one who can speak good English on the front desk. Cleaning and housekeeping staff are also friendly and they do a good job too, but they don't usually speak English. I had to talk to Front Desk to get things done and delivered.The kitchen does not contain anything, other than a coffee maker and some cups. But if you ask the Front Desk, they can bring you anything you need to make a meal. Jul 28 2016 	nice apartment at excellent location	We, a family of four with to children aged 9 and 10, stayed for a week at Lee Garden. Staff was friendly, especially the bell boy. They were practising there english and I attended an english lesson for the front deks staff. The lessons are a necessity because there english isn´t too good (on the other hand, neither is my chinese). The apartments are spacious and well equipped although there are no kitchen utensils. The gym was allright and there was a large swimming pool. The indeed asked us (as another travller wrote) to use swimming caps. We bought the cheap ones: 10 yuan. My girls liked the pool and it was something they looked forward to over the day when visting a temple or two.Breakfast is expensive and nothing special so you better make your own or go elsewhere. There´s enough in the neighbourhood. It´s on walking distance (15 minutes) of the forbidden city and literaly around the corner of the wangfuijing shopping street and nightmarket.An excellent place for families. Jul 5 2016	good location but dirty	First the good news: the location is great: center of the city, close to most tourist things. Very safe with things to do at all hours. Also the bathroom is very nice - clean, modern with a separate shower and bath. Better than I had expected.However, two negatives. 1) it's not clean. It looks clean, however, my two young children discovered tons of soot and dust on the carpet near the windows. It was disgusting. After just a few minutes of playing on the carpet, their hands and knees were covered with black dust. 2) the staff is stereotypically bad. When notified of the dirt, they just shrugged their shoulders and ignored my request to clean it.One more thing, the pool is very nice there, but they require everyone (including the men and children) to wear swim caps. If you buy them there they are 30 Yuan. Mar 18 2016	Perfect place to stay	After a crazy ride from the airport, where our driver could not find this place, we finally arrived to friendly night staff who got us settled in. In the morning we discovered how wonderfully located this place was. It is within walking distance of The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square, interesting shopping and a night food stall market. The rooms were quite large with an adequately equiped kitchen. There is a great health club you can use, as well as yoga and other classes you can take. Look no further for accomodation unless you feel the need to spend lots of money for an overpriced fancy hotel. Feb 2 2016 	loved the hotel. and the location is the best!	very nice service apartment hotel. the rooms are big with kitchenette. very nice pool. the best location!"
"Sep 19 2021 	Exceeded our expectations	Brought a long weekend away at a charity auction for this hotel. It really was a beautiful Hotel - in a French classic style. It seemed to be very quiet during our stay, which didn't bother us. Hotel is about 1 year old. Rooms - very clean and spacious with everything you could ask for in a 5 star hotel. Big bathroom with Loccitane amenites. Slippers and robes were a notch above average which pleased my wife very much !Pool / Gyym / Spa - Gyym is good with plenty of new equipment, the pool was indoor, but not heated, but it was the middle of summer so it was great. (swimming caps were compulsory, which you could buy at the pool reception). Massage prices seemed on the pricier side for China, but you don't expect anything less from a Hotel in this range.Food / Restaurants - Breakfast was normal daily buffett with selection of Asian and western fare. Room service, which I normally make allowances for was actually very good, my wife and I ordered a laksa and a club sandwich after our late night arrival and not sure if it was because we were tired / hungry but the food was great.Portuguese restuarant - very well done technically with good produce, it's just that I don't particularly like Portuguese food I realise now ( stick with Peking Duck at Da Dong, 5th floor above Gucci on next block - 2 minutes walk )Location - Big shopping centre 5 minutes walk. Starbucks across the road. Plenty of dining options nearby. Probably 15 -20 minute walk to Forbidden City and Tiananmen square. 5-10 minute walk to SubwayService was good with the staff more than happy to assist wherever they could. One thing though the hotel corridors look down into the lobby, so those that are afraid of heights I would suggest the lower floors. Not a real big deal though.Would definately stay there when next in Beijing. Aug 21 2021 	Most luxurius hotel of the world	I syated at the Legendale Hotel in Beijing for two nights with my wife, and I have no words to describe the hotel...Rooms are huge and abosutely full equiped,Flat screen 42 LCD, Dvd player, incredible bath, huge bed...The pool is also incredible it seems an antique pool of Rome, the health club, has also two jacuzzies, steam bath sauna....Buffet breakfast is incredible, all kind of food a lot of variety...The hotel is located in the best area of Beijing.I have stayed in 5 star hotels all around the world and I have no doubt that the The Legendale is the most luxurious of all...The service is unbeatable...You must go!!!"
"Oct 27 2021 	Great hotel for Americans	Great food..decorated for Christmas with carolers too...very beautiful hotel. Jul 12 2021 	excellent to get away from it all	The Loong palace is a gorgeous hotel and resort , it has fantastic facilities , and is the only place in Beijing you can feel alone......sadly it is because you are . After a hectic eight nights spent in the city touring all the sites it was lovely to just unwind and relax out at the Loong palace, the staff are happy smiling people and the place is five stars without a doubt . The great wall is visable on a clear day and the tombs are not so far away so even if you wanted to base yourself out here it is not so far from everything , It would be wonderful if more people used the hotel and travelled into the sites each day to then come back to quiet luxury of an evening . (it took about 30 mins from the forbidden city to reach the hotel ) small pointer -you need a cap to use the swimming pool . Jul 7 2021 	An excellent hotel	The hotel is located in the Chang Ping district and is close to the Great Wall and Ming Tombs and institutions such as Peking University. If you want to go to downtown Beijing, it is a 30 minute journey in a reasonably priced hotel car or a cab. The hotel has excellent facilities including indoor tennis courts, a bowling alley, well equipped recreation centre/ gymnasium, pool and a very good massage / spa. The restaurants are very good with an excellent range of cuisines and the Japanese restaurant is outstanding. The rooms are spacious and clean. For what you get, this is excellent value. Highly recommended. May 27 2021 	Loong Palace (aka-Lonely Palace)	The hotel is phenominal, but the problem is that it is in the middle of nowhere, thus as my colleagues call it &quot;the Lonely Palace.&quot; Why? This location is outside of the 5th ring highway (anything beyond the 5th ring is considered the boon-docks). But when I first moved to China, my company housed me at the Loong Palace for a month, and I enjoyed my stay, but being so far away, almost everywhere I wanted to go was a 40-50 RMB (6-7 USD) cab ride away. Although for the US people, 6-7 USD seems like nothing for a cab right, the equivalent for cost of living is that the cab ride is like 35 USD. So if you think about it, cab rides start off at 10 RMB for the first 2.9 KM, and then 1 RMB for every KM you travel. So if you do the math, you will realize how far the place is. I think from Tienneman Square to the Great Wall (Badaling section which is the area that you should go to), this is the halfway point. So if you're thinking in US, if you're going from LA to Vegas, this place would be Barstow. But this hotel is truly a 5-star hotel (as in Ritz Carlton standards). The manager there is Dutch, speaks fluent english and fluent Chinese. And since I had a corporate rate, the month that I stayed there, the total bill for the month came out to 900 USD. Now that's cheaper than the price of rent in NY city for a studio in the city.Like I said, it's not the most convenient of places, but the place is definitely a hidden gem. Also, with all the development going on by there is a new gigantic Japanese mall just north of the hotel which has a Korean Lotteria (burger joint), a Korean restaurant chain, a Sports Authority, and some other international brands. Feb 24 2021	World Class Hotel	The Hotel is very new. Clean, very western in terms of the bathrooms and room furnishings. Traveled with a very large group (350). The breakfasts we had at the Hotel were a mix of western and Chinese dishes. Nov 22 2018	a world class hotel great stay	others who had traveled to beijing warned us that a 5 star hotel in china might not be up to our usual standards. this is an exception. should be rated 5-1/2 stars. great room, outstanding common area facilities.the staff was always ready to help. money exchange, extra towels, business center and written chinese directions for taxi drivers, just a few of the great services.they try hard with english, but the difficulties encountered just added to the interest of traveling in china. my wife and i stayed for 8 days, and for someone who had traveled extensively, this hotel, and china, rated as one of our best travel experiences.john k, modesto ca Jun 19 2018 	Good business hotel in Beijing	I stayed at the Loong Palace while on a business trip for over 1 1/2 weeks. For business travelers, the club rooms are quite good, spacious clean and great respite from the day's work.The hotel is out in the middle of nowhere, for leisure purposes, its probably better to stay closer to the city either in the Financial District or the Choyang district.Food is good to excellent, the japanese restaurant providing excellent value.Staff was quite courteous and accomodating. Unfortunately, many didn't have sufficient english skills to be of true help. May 4 2018	Amazing Hotel - would definitely stay here again!	We booked our trip through our local community center. They were going through Collette Vacations. At first, I was a bit disappointed that this hotel was a bit far from the city, but it turned out to be centrally located to all of the sites on our trip. The hotel was just beautiful! There were doormen that greeted us each day. The staircase in the lobby was remarkable. Our rooms were perfect...I just can't say enough about how wonderful this hotel was!Room - The bathroom was black marble, with toothbrush, toothpaste, everything you could need. We used our room key to turn on the lights. The room was spotless. They had cans of Coke in the minibar, the kind with the &quot;pull off&quot; tab. I typically do not hit the mini bar - but I had to have one - it reminded me of when I was a kid...before the new fangled tabs that do not come off the can.Dining - We had the breakfast buffet each day. We had PLENTY of western dishes to choose from - omlets, cereal, fresh fruit, hot cereal, the list goes on. There were also Chinese options. The Chinese do not eat eggs/pancakes for breakfast. They eat lunch and dinner type foods for breakfast - and there were a lot of those options as well. We even had a Western Night dinner with Chocolate Cake and ICE CREAM! It was great!On the day we flew to Xian, we had to leave before dawn, and the hotel had boxed up &quot;breakfast&quot; for us. They packed yogurt, a delicious apple, that tasted like a pear, a hard boiled egg, a sandwich, etc. so that we did not go hungry.We had 2 &quot;fancy&quot; dinners at the hotel. One was the &quot;meet and greet&quot; dinner. Lots of chinese cuisine served on lazy susan's. Mostly appetizer types choices...but very good. The other was on our last night. We had a lovely sit down dinner with choice of entrees. Service - The hotel delivered and picked up our luggage for us, we did not have to transport our luggage at all. They were very helpful with exchanging our money and mailing our post cards. The staff spoke plenty of Engish. I did visit the business center to send email to my teenagers who stayed behind with their dad. (calling and emailing hit my wallet the hardest!)I cannot say anything bad about our visit to this hotel. It was truly an amazing visit! Mar 22 2018 	Very nice hotel far from the city center	We stayed at this hotel for ten days on a combined business/sightseeing trip. We were attending a conference held at this hotel; otherwise we probably would not have booked it since it is is very far from the city center.However, we found the hotel to be an excellent choice. The property is beautiful and has all the amenities expected of a good five-star hotel (pool, spa, shopping, gym, tennis, bowling...). There are many excellent restaurants on-site, which is good since there is not much else in this area. The restaurants were generally rather pricey by Beijing standards, but still much cheaper than we were used to so we didn't mind. The rooms were very spacious, immaculately clean and well-decorated. The bathrooms were very large with lovely furnishings. Free bottled water was provided in the rooms since the tap water isn't safe to drink. In-room internet access is available for a cost - however you pay only when logged on, and while we were online frequently the total cost for the stay was negligible.We paid a very reasonable 650 yuan per night, including the buffet breakfast which was very extensive, and excellent quality. There are of course much cheaper hotels in Beijing, but this seems to be a good price for a five-star hotel.The location is the main downside, since it does take some time to get into the center. However we found it to be simple and inexpensive: a five-minute taxi to LongZe station (12 yuan every time), followed by the line 13 train and the line 2 subway (5 yuan total). It took up to an hour but again, was quite simple. Note that it's not really possible to walk anywhere from this hotel, since the highway is very close. Dec 7 2007	Make sure to check out the spa	Very nice and clean hotel. Most desk staff speak a little English, but double check important details. Breakfast buffet is very nice. The huge spa is something not to be missed. Prices are most reasonable. I prefered the 9th floor spa to the services offered in the pool area (better ambience, though the pool area is cheaper).In restaurants, order your meat more cooked than you like it. Ours tended to keep coming our rarer than we'd prefer.It is in the ourskirts of town, so not necesarily convenient, but great value for the money, and taxis are cheap(make sure you only get in metered taxis!). Have fun! Sep 6 2007	Can't miss	Wonderful Hotel. One of the best I've stayed in anywhere in the world. We stayed in the new section just opened in March '07. Wonderful breakfast buffet also. We were on a tour so the distance to the city wasn't an issue. Conveneient to the Great Wall and the Olympic stadium but maybe too far for business downtown. Sep 6 2007 	Top Notch Hotel!	I've stayed here twice now...Both times just transiting through Beijing on my way back to the states...Flew in the night before and left the next morning or afternoon. The first time I stayed there was about 2 years ago...I booked it through Crowne Plaza's website. I arrived 3 days after it dropped the Crowne Plaza affiliation...Which scared me a bit. I was thinking before getting there &quot;Uh-oh, the place wasn't up to C/P standards!&quot; I couldn't have been more wrong. A GORGEOUS hotel, so big, such great rooms--big, clean, comfortable, many amenities...I could go on and on. My second trip there, I arrived late at night and was flying back to the States the next afternoon...Which allowed me to visit the Great Wall at BaDaLing in the morning and still catch my flight. I arranged a hotel car to take me there, wait for me for a few hours and drive me back to the hotel so I could freshen up before my flight...A GREAT experience. I had the hotel car for about 4 hours and ran me about US$100. Well worth it to finally see the wall. 4 trips to China each year X 10 years and still hadn't seen the Great Wall until that trip! Car driver was friendly, although almost no English spoken (thank God I speak some Chinese).Superb hotel, GREAT value. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra US$20 and book a small suite. Well worth it.Ate one meal in the Chinese restaurant...Great food, reasonable prices and fantastic service.While it is relatively close to the Great Wall and the airport, it is a long way from the City Center. The PERFECT hotel for doing what I did--fly in quick for one night, see the wall and fly out. One of these days I will make it into the city, but will have a tough time staying away from Loong Palace! Aug 2 2007	The Best of Service	Our Beijing vacation stay ended July 30, 2007 and it was the best vacation my wife and I ever experienced. Our room 8512 was beautiful and bright. The staff was outstanding, always very helpful and answered all our questions. My wife and I hope to someday return. The best wishes and long life to the entire staff.Hank Hammersmith and Lan Ying MiDiamond Bar, CAUSA Jul 9 2007	Amazing Hotel with best service	We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group based out of Hong Kong. Have to say it was so luxurious. downside is amenities had to be paid for so couldn't really do anything else once you got to the hotel. Rooms were superb and breakfast had a great variety. Rooms were very large with a spacious bathroom. Felt like home. Great view of back terrace. Had nothing to complain about. Very remote location. About 70 Yuan Taxi ride to city center...check out the silk market but be prepared to bargain ridiculously. :D May 25 2007 	Had a great stay !	Just returned from another trip to Loong Palace and the improvements regarding service I have seen are getting better - especially for China.The Restaurants still need improving regarding service although the menus had changed for the better since my last visit in February.This time I went with my wife and we had a few days of leisure together which was a nice break from the usual buisness trip and I had a chance to properly explore all the leisure facilities which are really good and well maintained.Although the hotel was really busy with an International Taekwondo event she was really taken care of, especially at their new Spa in their new South Wing called My Spa which is certainly one of the best we have seen in Beijing.The understanding of English also seems to be improving as one member of staff told me they now have regular English lessons.I hope they keep it up as I will be going back in Sptember. May 23 2007 	Excellent Hotel	A brilliant Hotel with excellent facilities, friendly staff and good resturants.Rooms are large, well serviced, and well appointed room service is fast and efficient.Business facilites were good, and it is well located in relation to the high tech districts.The Great Wall and other major sightseeing areas are within easy reach.I will be staying there again. Mar 29 2007	Excellent accomodations.	Two friends and I spent 6 nights at the Loong Palace. It is a lovely hotel deserving of it's 5 star rating. The employees were very helpful, very accomodating. Most spoke enough English that we had no problems exchanging money, asking about areas we wanted to visit, ordering room service or ordering at the bars and restaurants, even getting a massage. This hotel is a bit out of downtown Beijing but taxi rides are very inexpensive and taxi cabs were numerous. Mar 5 2007 	Excellent Rooms 	The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious, and the staff is excellent. Yes, as several reviews have pointed out, English skills are often lacking, but a little bit of patience goes a long way. Besides...you are in China after all..how fluent is your Chinese? The hotel has several restaurants (excellent breakfast in the Bravo on 2nd floor), a spa, bowling alley, tennis court, and other amenities to fill your free time (assuming you have any). I will definitely stay at the Loong Palace again. Top notch! The ONLY negative for anyone travelling strictly for pleasure is the location (45 minute cab ride from downtown). Dec 8 2006 	Service Challenged	The hotel is quite beautiful inside and the rooms are furnished well, but it is a typical Chinese business in that the service is non-existent and they do not attempt to proactively provide assistance. In regards to meals, don't even attempt to order room service in English unless you have a sedative and alot of patience. I stay here for business due to the location, but after spending several weeks on-site I will be staying downtown in January and paying the extra cab fare to avoid the poor customer service. Jul 4 2006	Nice Hotel but fair customer service	I have been on vacation with my family to Beijing, and we stayed at the Loong Palace Hotel throughout our 5 day journey.The hotel is in some remote outskirts of the city, but travelling has been reasonable. The rooms are nice, clean and big. The bathroom have also been in good condition. Variety of TV channels and breakfast have also been good.However, what annoys me most has been the customer service. My father and I went to access the internet at its Business Center one evening. We checked for the price at Front Desk beforehand, and was told the first 30 mins would cost RMB $32. Fine. Even though a bit expensive, it's not over the top.We went to the Biz Center then, checked a couple of emails for around 25+ mins. When we are about to checkout and pay, a bill of RMB $80 has been sent in. It came as a real shock. Subseqeuntly, we found out that the billing was &quot;First 10 mins would cost RMB $32, and then $1 per min afterwards&quot;.We feel cheated by the Hotel, and summoned the Duty Manager for reasoning. Sarcastically, he offered fruit plates as remedy, but insisted the full bill to be paid. He also guaranteed an investigation and refund us in full if the mistake has been made by his staff.The following evening, the Manager returned with an evelope of RMB $8. He said it has been clarified that his staff made a mistake, but the billing of internet has also been posted in the Biz Ctr, and he claimed we should have checked again before using the service. The RMB $8 is a 10% refund to show the &quot;goodwill&quot; of hotel. He even claimed that this event had the endorsement of his GM and there'd be no use if we keep complaining. We refused to take the refund and walked away. I think the handling is totally unacceptable, given that the mistake has been made by his staff, and the impolite manner of the Manager. It's not a matter of paying extra for the service, but the breakdown of trust and expectation from a &quot;5-star hotel&quot;. How can such a hotel in service for several years with front desk staff unaware of the pricing of its own service ?I'd say other than this unpleasant experience, the whole journey has been enjoyable. However, this incident spoilt our journey. Jan 6 2006	Great Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with a tour group. The hotel was beautiful and clean. The food in the restaurants was good with a good selection. The staff was friendly and helpful, although not all of them spoke english. The hotel is located out from the city center, but a cab ride downtown was only $8 to $10. It was quiet and had a large indoor swimming pool. I would definitely stay there again. Nov 23 2005	Excellent Service from staff but a little far	I had a tour group of children and the staff bent over backwards to accommodate us. The facilities were fantastic and we especially liked the swimming pool which was free and supervised. The hotel was a little far from Beijing but that didn't spoil our enjoying being there. I would certainly recommend it to anyonw. Nov 17 2005	Excellent Hotel	I stayed there for a week. The amenities at this hotel are among the best by far of any other I have stayed in. The employees for the most part spoke broken english, but well enough to hold a decent conversation. There were quite a few, however, that spoke english very well. The food at the Palms restaurant on premises was very good, with many, many choices available to satisfy the hunger cravings of almost anyone. The choices range from western to asian cusine, with very well prepared on both. Not only would I recommend to anyone, I plan on going back and staying at this same hotel. Oct 20 2005	Very Poor	Just spent a miserable time at this hotel. The building is actually very nice and the room big. The problem is service and lack of English speaking staff. Impossible to order room service food and when it arrived it was not at all what we ordered. The coffee shop was packed with noisy tourist groups and was a mess both mornings. Virtually no one at the reception desk could understand basic English. Could not tell me where the executive club loounge was???Pretty hotel but avoid at all costs because of service. Sep 26 2005	Nice but not a Crowne Plaza Any longer	Booked by a friend and found out upon arrival it is no longer a Crowne Plaza. It is called Loong Palace Hotel and Resort. Could not believe all the recreational activites available, even a movie theatre (not open though). Weekend BBQ in the garden was super.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Nice big clean rooms and good price value. May 11 2021 	Tout simplement nul ..."
"Sep 11 2021	Luxury serviced resident cheats people... be careful	We have booked this hotel through booking.com and cancel the booking 3 weeks before the booking date. According cancel condition this should cost 0 USD. After our trip to China we discovered the Luxery serviced resedent has charged us for 1 night even the booking.com has confirmed the fault of the hotel. The hotel will not return money at once. The manager said it will take 3 months to refund the money. After a lot of communication the Luxury serviced resident stops communcate with us.... So what can we do ... the booking.com will not take the responsibility as well. We can not do any thing else than just wait....That why: don't ever ever give your credit card information to this hotel. They will cheat you and don't care any thing about customers satifation Sep 2 2021 	Okay stay for family	We stayed for three nights in a two bedroom apartment which was very spacious and had heaps of space for the four of us. The location is good with the main road only five minutes up the road, heaps of buses going downtown for next to nothing and lots of atms around for cash. There is a 7/11 across the carpark - cheap beer and snacks - there is quite a smell in there and I don't know about eating some of the food in the heating servers. The front desk were helpful and always smiling. The only issue was cleanliness of the apartment - it didn't really feel hotel clean but it was okay - though we did have to keep the kitchen door closed the whole time. We didn't bother eating at MCS as the food was very average and even with the breakfast included in the price we decided that cornflakes and milk from 7/11 was better. There was a great restaurant up the road about 5 mins walk called De Tai Lou - nice food, reasonable price and walking distance after a few drinks - the menu is a laugh. Chips or french fries are called &quot;Department of the Bombing&quot; - the kids had them every meal just to say it. Overall the apartment is okay, space for a family of four (sharing beds), the 7/11 is handy, good location and the De Tai Lou is lovely for a meal. Jul 8 2021 	just okay	We stayed in this hotel last October. We had some mixed feelings about the place - some good, some bad, but none fantastic or horrible.First impressions were mixed. We were arriving late at night and once we navigated into the city and onto the street of the hotel it took us 20 minutes to actually find the place. It's not directly on the road, but off in a plaza, with no well lit signage at night and no direct driveway. Our poor taxi driver didn't know where it was either, and we just kept circling around. Finally we spotted it, and had to lug our bags over a grassy median and through a parking lot to get to the hotel.The reception staff was extremely friendly, a young woman who was very enthusiastic even at the late hour. Her english was pretty good.The hotel itself feels old and creaky, but it's not necessarily a negative thing. The main halls and lobby all seemed quite clean and well cared for. There are two elevators to access the rooms.The room itself was a one bedroom loft. A split level with living/dining/kitchen/bathroom on main floor, and bedroom/shower/bathroom on top floor. It's rare to find a one bedroom two bathroom hotel room. The shower is a wet room style - you shower over the sink and among some grimy looking pipes. The furniture seemed clean but not new, the rooms were the same. They were definitely not spotless (lots of dust and grime in the bathrooms, cracks along the walls), but they were not filthy enough to make us uncomfortable - no bugs or real causes for concern, just well worn. The bed sheets were relatively clean (I had a black smudge on my pillow case). Generally we were happy with our choice - great location, good service, rooms were okay. I could see that a place like this would be great for a family, or to have a space to hang out (the split level made it feel more like a home rather than a hotel room). We enjoyed it for what we needed it for - a bed to come home to at night, and a shower.The hotel is located on a side street (Jianhua Nan lu), just off the main strip of Jianguomenwai Ave. There is not a ton of stuff right around the hotel, but there is a 24 hour 7-11 store (great to buy water, snacks, etc), and Jianguomenwai gets you to all the attractions in a flash. If you are traveling alone you might want to taxi it to the hotel at night as the side street is not well lit.There was also a great cafe right around the corner - breakfast was included for hotel guests there every morning, which was quite tasty, a mix of continental and chinese fare. Also we'd go there late at night for some tea, to use their free wireless internet and listen to their great jazz music. The staff at this cafe were so friendly, and they made a mean cup of tea.I'd probably stay here again if I were on a budget. If I could splurge a few more dollars I'd probably stay elsewhere. Jun 20 2021 	Can be better	The 3 bedroom apartment we stayed in was great in design, we loved loft. But the large apartment was not very clean. We have to wear disposable slippers to walk around. Mineral water was only given on first day. All other hotels we stayed in during our trip gave us 2 bottles of mineral water every day every room. The toiletries are also not properly replenished. We had to use one roll of toilet paper collected from a previous hotel. But our apartment was serviced daily. Problem with the air-con remote control was speedily remedied. Front desk staff have to be trained to greet guests, many just ignore you. Bellhop, some open the door for you and greet you, but not others. Assistant manager was helpful and courteous throughout, from reserving room to checking-out. She even called to find out how we were. If only all the staff can be trained to be of her quality. It was the same with the MCS coffee around the corner, which provided breakfast for the Luxury guests. Helpful, obliging, but could do with more smiles. Food was o.k., my only worry are the occasional flies. But there are covers for the dishes. But I didn't take the jams. The security in the hotel is assuring, but the laundrette room is outside of the security door in the carpark in basement 1. A bit scary to go there, I zoom in and out as soon as I can each time. 3 washers and 2 dryers (1 more out of order) were inside the room, each machine require a bronze coin from the front desk costing RMB 20. Washing powder is provided free in the room. There is a 7-eleven in front of the hotel, very useful. YongAnLi subway station is 15 mins walk away. From there you can reach Tiananmen, forbidden city, wangfujin street, tiantan, etc. easily. Fast food, small eateries, restaurants abound in the vicinity, some just round the corner, some 15 minutes walk away. I recommend De Tai Lou (restaurant) which is 3 min walk away. Chinese food, cheap and takeaway allowed. Traffic in the vicinity can be quite heavy at times though. Jun 19 2021 	Central location execellent value.	We stayed here for 6 nights and found it a welcome respite after a long day sightseeing around Beijing. Rooms were roomy, clean and comfortable , breakfasts in the attached restraunt were reasonable although simple, although they offered no cereal and when asked did not know what cereal was. We used taxis extensivly and found the cost minimal from this central accomadation. Its not a 5 star hotel but for a family (5 adults) it was very good value. Jun 14 2021 	Great base while in Beijing	My partner and I just spent 6 nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence in a 1-bedroomed apt. We found it was a great base at very reasonable rates (We paid $56/night). Apartment:The apartment was huge - which was a nice change from some of the other micro-rooms we stayed in while travelling around China - with a lounge area, separate kitchen and bathroom downstairs; and the bedroom, desk area, second bathroom - and even a separate clothes drying room (which we made good use of) upstairs. The space is so large that there are 3 air conditioners to keep it cool. The funishings were definitely on the cheap side and a little worn, but perfectly adequate and the bed was comfortable. Apt had free internet.We found the front desk staff friendly, but not terribly knowledgable. The workout room is reasonable with a couple of running machines, universal equipment and some free weights.Location:The location is fine - the good news is that all the main tourist spots are only about a $2.00 taxi ride away. The bad news is that all the main tourist spots are a $2.00 taxi ride away!! The only thing of interest within walking distance is the Silk market. The nearest subway entance is about a 10-15 min walk (right by the Silk market).The apartment complex is hard for taxi drivers to find - it is near the base of the road on the Western side. Just keep an eye out for signs for the 7/11.Nearby Amenities:As others have mentioned there is a 7/11 less than 2 min walk, as well as a huge Western style supermarket in the SciTech plaza about a 7 minute walk away - with everything you could possible want. There is also a street of Western style restaurants on Xiushui St ( directly behind the Friendship store) popular with the large expat population in the area. Includes an American diner and an excellent Tibetan restaurant we ate at one night.Cons:The only thing that annoyed us is that machines in the laundry room require tokens (at $4.00 a pop) which you have to buy at the front desk. We bought a half dozen when we first arrived and ended up having a couple left over at the end of the week. When we went to return these to the front desk we were told that they were nonrefundable. (They gave us a weak excuse that the money had already been logged by accounting!!) - even thought the money is just stored in a small tin along with the tokens. It would have been nice if they had told us that when we bought them!! Apr 4 2021 	Best Kept Secret for the Greatest Value in Beijing	We looked through Tripadvisor and found this great hotel Luxury serviced residence .We were so happy we cancelled our reservations at Marriott ! We stayed in a one bedroom unit. This comes with a living room, full kitchen, seperate bedroom in the upper level, 2 bathrooms ! cooking utensils, dishes, microwave, refrigerator etc etc ! We felt perfectly at home . This is our 4 th night ! The staff is always very friendly and helpful. They will guide you to anything ! Change money at great rates. There is a 24 hr seven eleven across. This comes with coupons for breakfast at MCS coffee. Taxis are cheap and we can get to anywhere in 10 to 20 RMB ! Dont forget to visit The Place , the new mall just 5 mins cab ride ! We wish we had such a hotel in every city we travel ! We booked through expedia and got 30 % offf for every 3 nights you book ! What a deal ! We got the 790 sq ft apartment for about $ 68 US per night with breakfast ! Mar 10 2021 	A spacious home away from home with facilities	I booked into the Luxury Serviced Residence on the basis of positive internet reviews and very reasonable cost. My wife and I were very happy with this quiet and spacious apartment which provided all the facilities needed to become our Beijing home for 10 days. Kitchen facilities were very good and the apartment was efficiently serviced daily. The bed was firm just like at home with an inner spring mattress on a slat base, the way we like it. Security was excellent. Desk staff had limited English but helped us wherever they could, and always with a smile. A display of tourist pamphlets would have been helpful but it seemed that in this city tourist are left to find their own way. Fortunately my extensive internet research prior to leaving Australia proved invaluable as a tourist. Neither the downstairs or upstairs ensuite had a bath but we showered comfortably. Breakfast in the downstairs cafe was cold and terrible so we used hotel vouchers wisely and didn't pay for breakfasts that were barely better than nothing. Buses (10 minutes walk) and subway (15 minutes) were regular, cheap and handy for city access although very crowded. If I return to Beijing I'll again stay at the Luxury Residence without hesitation. Nov 4 2008 	Outstanding value!	I cannot recommend this hotel/serviced apartment highly enough. - The front desk staff was always extremely helpful and communication was easier than you may be led to believe is likely in China. We relied heavily on the staff for translations of locations (we were in Beijing on business and thus had to travel to several locations during the course of our stay that weren't typical tourist destinations) and they were fantastic.- The apartment itself vastly exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment, and our space was set up &quot;loft style&quot; with a 2 floor layout; 2 bedrooms above and 1 on the ground floor. The apartment also had a large kitchen, huge main room, respectable Ikea-styled furnishings, and 2 bathrooms. The apartment was clean, well maintained, and even included a DVD player and sound system.- The location was outstanding. The Chaoyang district is large but contains quite a bit of commercial and nightlife/restaurant activity, so you're in the &quot;right&quot; area of the city IMO. You're also relatively close to some of the main tourist attractions (Tienaman, Forbidden City, etc.).- Considering that we paid around $150/night for 3 people, I feel this was an extremely good value. I'm a fairly well seasoned international traveler, and rarely have I been more pleasantly surprised than I was in this instance. This was a comfortable, hassle-free stay and I'd book it again in a heartbeat.- One word of advice...taxi drivers do have some difficulty finding the building. Once we'd arrived, it wasn't a problem because we had our bearings, but on your initial trip in from the airport, you should be aware that the entrance to the building is off the street...you need to go past a gate into a little courtyard/roundabout. Oct 21 2008 	Great Value 	We stayed here from Oct 11 to Oct 14 2008. Very well located and very well-maintained. Going back to the apartment is like going home each day.LOCATION1. Walking distance to Subway line 1 - Stations are: A. JianGuoMen Station (Line 1 &amp; Line 2) B. YongAnLi (Line 1)2. Taxis have a hard time looking for the entrance because it is very nondescript. Tell them it is near the Beijing Friendship store. Look for SPR Cafe &amp; 7-11. Remember to print the map of the hotel in MANDARIN.3. Embassy area in Chaoyang. Walking distance (15mins) to the famous Silk Market where they sell at the fake stuff.RECEPTION1. Friendly. Anticipated that that we will need toiletries (serviced apartments usually do not provide).2. Not very proficient in navigating around the tourist areas. Was unable to answer question wrt to visiting the Bird's Nest &amp; Water Cube.FOODNo breakfast provided. Hey, you are staying in a serviced apartment with stove, microwave and toaster. There is also a cafe at the same block. So you will not starve......APARTMENTThe pictures speaks for itself! While the apartment is very new (age is starting to show), it is Scandanavian-designed and very well-maintained. Well, we have a soft spot for lofts, and we simply loved it. There is a DVD player. So you can hop to the DVD shop next block, and feast on DVDs (there's not much to do in BJ at night.).OTHER FACILITIESLaunderette, Gym.WOULD WE STAY HERE AGAIN ?Absolutely. We paid less than US$100 per night for the length of stay and I would say it is absolutely worth it!! Very centralised. You can either than the subway (for 3 to 4 stops) to Wangfujing or even take a public bus f(just outside the BJ Friendship store) for RMB1. My bet is on the subway so that you can avoid the horrendous BJ traffic jams. Sep 29 2008 	Great apartment hotel in Embassy area!	We booked 8 nights at the Luxury Serviced Residence (An Ascott property) in Sept 08. I had read one other review on Tripadvisor which was positive but it was difficult to find other reviews.We were pleasantly surprised to say the least. The hotel is located in the embassy area which we think is terrific. When we checked in, the desk person took us to our apartment. We were impressed with this personal service and sheer enthusiasm of the tour. She was obviously proud of her hotel's apartment and services. At check in, we were invited to a free party to celebrate the Moon Festival which is a very important celebration in Chinese life. For the party, all we had to do is show up in the lobby and the hotel took care of transferring us to the hutong cafe and hosting the party. (We had a great time).The apartment is large by any standards. The first floor has a living room/ dining room area, a kitchen, and a half bathroom. The second floor has a large bedroom, desk area, and bathroom with a shower. We met several people who have lived at the Luxury Serviced Residence for years. One couple we met at the party has lived there for three years.For those who choose to cook, there is a full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave, hot water pot, toaster, and dishes to match. The only thing we added was some microwavable dishes. There is a 7/11 across the circle driveway for quick snacks and sundries.There always seems to be someone who speaks English on duty. Each time we set out for the day we would stop by the desk and ask that our destination be written out in Chinese. Taxi drivers, in our experience, do not speak English and most do not read maps. There is a subway stop (Jian Guo men) about 1/4 mile away. It is an easy walk and the subway is extremely easy to use. The Bank of China is on the main cross street nearly around the corner. We would recommend this hotel for anyone who prefers an apartment. May 19 2008 	very friendly LSR	The first week of May 2008 we stayed at LSR. The people are very friendly and helpfull. The rooms were clean. We stayed there with 2 children. (8 and 4) breakfast is at the corner of the building SPR Cofee. Across the building there is a little supermarket 24 H 7 days a week open."
"Oct 10 2021 	Nice room and good value	The hotel is about 15 minutes walk from the closest subway station, 20 minutes walk to the Bird Nest, a quite and nice neighborhood. Also close to the airport and not far from the center of the city.The pool is really nice with warm water. But beware of the strange rule that you have to wear a swimming cap to swim! Oct 10 2021 	NICE!	This really is a nice place to stay. Rates were quite reasonable. I upgraded to the Continental Floor and very much enjoyed the breakfast and happy hour. A very comfortable 10 day stay. The glass wall between the bathroon and the bedroom took some getting used to. The location was a bit off the tourist track, but I like it that way. Several good neighborhood restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Subway was the way to go more than a few miles. Quick, but rarely a seat available.I would definitely stay there again unless I found another killer deal. Oct 9 2021	Superb hotel ideally located	EXcellent hotel with very spacious and comfortable rooms.Beds felt on the hard side but slept like a log!Lovely bathrooms and towels etc also tea and coffee facilities.Ideally located for the Birds Nest and Cube which are set in a lovely extensive park where the Chinese relax and play. Super to walk around in the evening and watch the 'locals' Fantastic breakfast.Superb pool (hats required ) Oct 2 2021 	excellent hotel - spa was FANTASTIC!	was recommended to stay at this hotel by a friend. very lovely room, might be a bit far out from the city centre but it's worth it as it is quieter and less busy. what i wanted to say in particular is their spa, it was SO GOOD - very tranquil, very pretty rooms and the massage therapist was extremely skilled. excellent value for money so definitely give it a try! Aug 27 2021 	Excellent - if you can get it at a good rate its well worth it	Got a room for just US60 and it was excellent. Little to fault about the hotel. Location from subway is about 10 minutes but the line goes directly to the centre of town. The hotel is not in the downtown area. Its to the north about a 30 mins walk from the Bird's Nest Olympic Stadium.Breakfast and drinks are very pricey but there are very affordable eating options only a minute from the hotel. No bars nearby as far as I could see. Aug 24 2021 	Nice hotel great breakfast buffets but not ideal location	We stayed here, as our tour package had a last minute shuffle. We had wanted a hotel closer to the touristy spots, and the Marco Polo is close to the Olympic venues. The net effect is that our group had to commute almost every day to get the more touristy sites.....it was closer to the Great Wall. However, the hotel itself was lovely. The rooms were large, very nicely done, and we had a separate sitting area, although my wife and I really did not need it. The breakfast buffets were great, with a mix of western and Chinese. Aug 22 2021 	Excellent 5 star hotel although still no English!	Everything you expect from a 5 star hotel is present here, including lovely spacious rooms, large beds, luxurious bathrooms, flat screen tv, internet, 24 hr room service, large breakfast, tasty food etc etc. Only 2 negative things to comment on really: 1. The location is a bit far from the places of interest (I was on a business trip, so it didn't make any difference. 2. Nobody spoke any English whatsoever. Anyone travelling in China will know that nobody speaks English, but you would expect the reception staff at a 5 star hotel to be able to handle the basics. Jul 29 2021 	Great 5 star Hotel	I stayed at the Marco Polo Parkside Hotel for three days in July. The rooms were very spacious, clean, comfortable and large. It was truly a 5 star hotel. Each day, we received two small bottles of complimentary water.The bathroom is huge, with a deep tub and separate shower stall. Some rooms have a very interesting glass bathroom wall. A shade comes down for privacy.The beds were very clean and comfortable. I found the rooms to be sound proof and did not hear traffic from the outside or noise from the other guests.The free buffet breakfast was fantastic. They had someone wearing a mask (H1N1 precaution) cooking fresh omelets and eggs for guests. There were numerous Chinese and Western dishes to choose from.The restaurant was big and the service efficient.Across the busy street, in front of the hotel, is a big supermarket. There is also a McDonalds near by. There are also banks close by. Jul 15 2021 	Postive experience	We have been positivly surprised from this hotel. The room is really big with a luxirous interior and bathroom. The bed is really comfortable and there is enough space for the luggage. The bathroom is stylish with tub and shower. The internet connection is fast and a desk for working in the room. The rooms are facing the street, it is a little noisy - but e.g. with the aircondition on no problem. The spa and swimming pool area is very simple, when we went there the saunas have not even been on. But everything is clean, they provide towels etc.Within a walking distance from around 15 min. you can reach the subway and olympia area. We would definitly recommend this hotel. May 19 2021 	Pure indulgence	This is a hotel worth a visit. The staff are very attentive and the rooms are some of the best in China - according to our sample! The food inthe restaurants is very good. The concierge are keen to order theatre tickets, cabs etc nothing is a troubleWe will stay here again if we go back to beijing Apr 18 2021 	Quality all the way	I stayed at The Marco Polo Parkside for 10 days in March, 2018. Contrary to other hotels in China, I found this hotel to be fully deserving of its 5 star rating.Located just 10 minutes walk from the Bird's Nest stadium and Olympic Park, it's understated elegance and charm were a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of downtown Beijing. The standard room I stayed in was spacious, elegant, and completely quiet. BBC and CNN were available on the large flat screen TV in my room, along with free internet.Each morning, a splendid Western breakfast buffet was available alongside a traditional Chinese breakfast.. All in all, an excellent hotel which I hope to be visiting in the near future. Apr 9 2021 	Good value Luxury	The hotel is near the Olympic Park which is a bit remote form the centre but accessible by taxi or subway (15 minutes on foot from the hotel). The hotel is also located in a busy area with an excellent roast duck restaurant and a big supermarket on the opposite side (could be noisy if the room is facing the road). The room is very spacious and the fitness faciliates are excellent. Two small bottles of mineral water is provided everday free of charge. The look through bathroom is very nice. The service is also very good and the catering is nice. It is definitely a good deal when staying at this hotel at a promotional rate. The only complaint is about the mattress which is really hard. Feb 6 2021 	Very nice	I took my first trip to Beijing this past December; a friend recommnded this hotel to me. After the long (14 hour) flight, I really needed a good night's sleep.Upon arriving at the Marco Polo, I was pleasantly surprised: it looked like it did on the web - the pictures were spot-on. The staff were very friendly (although most spoke very limited English), and the room was clean and warm. Everything worked just fine, and bottles of water were provided daily.The only cons were that the bedsheets were pretty rough (I actually scratched up my elbows while turning over in my sleep), and the shower door wouldn't fasten properly, resulting in the bathroom floor getting soaked.Otherwise, everything was great, and I'd be more than willing to stay there again. Mar 3 2018	Overall a nice hotel	I stayed at the Marco Polo Parkside while I was in Beijing. The hotel is conveniently located to the technology zone. I was easily able to take a quick 20 minute taxi ride each morning to the office.Finding a taxi might seem difficult at this hotel but it really is not if you just ask the doorman to call one for you. They have radios to call while you wait in the comfort of the hotel lobby.The hotel is fairly new and well kept. However, I experienced the same shower problem mentioned by another reviewer. Water does leak out of the shower stall and when I reported the problem to the front desk they offered to move me. I soon learned to not point the water where the glass corners meet as that seemed to be where the water leaked.I called housekeeping for extra towels and for laundry service. They did not seem to have anyone answering the phones who could speak English so that was somewhat of a challenge.The Chinese restaurant also did not have anyone who spoke English on my visit. This resulted in an extra dish being delivered to my table because of a language mix-up. It did not matter since the food was delicious and I enjoyed what I had been served.My room included a daily breakfast buffet which had a nice variety of food. They can cook eggs to order but you might have to track someone down to do it as the cook does not usually offer to do so unless you ask.On 2-3 mornings, it was very difficult to find a clean table. I think they might have had staffing issues as this was not the case on the other 5 days that I was this hotel.The Beijing Olympic village is a 2-3 block walk from this hotel which will be nice during the summer games.Overall, my stay at this hotel was very nice and I would consider staying there again. Sep 2 2007	Below 4 star standard!	I just stayed there for 3 nights. The reason I chose this hotel is just because it's a new hotel opened for just 3 months time. However, it's quite disappointed that the room is not so new as expected. Can you imagine that water will slip out from shower room for a new 4 star hotel? The staff are absolutely cool and not helpful. They will never greet any guest. The location of this hotel is just fine. It's about 30 minutes taxi ride from the city centre, but the problem is most taxi driver still don't know its location. Another bad experience I had is the housekeeping staff left my room door unlocked after the room cleaning. I will not recommend this hotel unless you've got a very good rate and don't mind encounter any bad experience. I'll rate this hotel below 4 star standard."
"Nov 17 2021 	Comfortable Hotel - But the area is not great	Billed as a 5 star, it's a perfectly comfortable hotel with really generous sized rooms . Staff are charming with a good command of English. Dining options are alright but they need to be more than that as there are no decent restaurants in the area. Stayed in West Beijing for a conference,but would prefer to stay more centrally if travelling for leisure as the area is not very interesting. But taxis are cheap so it wasn't a huge issue. National obsession with swine flu meant frequent temperature checks which was a bit bizarre. Oct 9 2021 	Very Nice reasonable hotel	We stayed at the Marriott West for an adoption homeland trip traveling with 6 other families. Rooms were large and nicely decorated and furnished. Had a great view of the CCTV tower from the window. I was hesitant due to location as I prefer to stay closer to the shopping and square but there was a Subway and Baskin Robbins in the front part of the property, a Pizza hut next door and a great noodle shop next door with picture menus. The staff was always helpful and kind and spoke decent English. The lobby itself was limited and small but not that big of a deal. The lobby did have Wifi access though. Breakfast buffet was also great. The location is only a ten minute cab ride to some major attractions so all in all I would stay here again. It was much nicer than previous hotels in Beijing we have stayed at. Aug 18 2021 	one of the hotels	compared to the other 5 star hotel, the lobby is not that impressive. otherwise, I have no other complaints Jun 12 2021 	Excellent Service	Hi There,I was at this hotel in Oct 2018 with Friends touring Bejing and must say that the hote was fabulous. The staff were friendly and informative. The location was a little out of the main city, but there were no issues getting around the city and downtown area. Also, the room and it amenities were excellent. Aug 8 2018 	Not Marriott Standard	As a frequent guest of Marriott facilities I would rank this as the worst Marriott property I have stayed at so far. The location is quite far and taxi is required, which can get tiring when you are fighting a 30-45 minute cab ride to get to San Li Tun district, which is were we spent most of our time. The other issue, well this property is in need of some upgrades and reno's. Our room had some weird sewage smell, we contacted front desk and we were upgraded but still the room felt a little tired. Staff and service were above average and no complaints there. Just issues around the condition of the hotel and the location was a little far for us. May 13 2018 	A Hidden Treasure	We stayed in this hotel as a family of four from February 5 to 10 during the Chinese New Year holiday. Even though the price of the hotel was attractive, I hesitated before I made the reservation because the location was a little odd and Beijing's traffic was notorious. However, this hotel turned out to be a very pleasant surprise for all of us. The room was HUGE by any standard. All furniture and bathroom amenities were very well maintained. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everybody paid attention to details and was ready to reach out and make their guests happy. This type of service attitude is not very commonly seen in China. One example is, during our stay, we felt the air was too dry and I asked for a humidifier which they didn't normally provide. They instantly gave us one that looked like it was being used in their office by themselves. The only down side of the hotel is its location. Not only that it is located on the west side of the city while most other &quot;high end&quot; hotels are on the east side. That was not a noticeable problem for us during the holiday when traffic was light. The problem was, the hotel's main entrance was in the back of the complex. Cars must drive around the buidling to find the hotel. That leaves all guest rooms facing the northeast and not exposed to the sunlight during the day. If Marriott was the landlord of the buiding, I would think they retreated into this subprime part of the buidling to give the sunny spots to their tenants for higher rental yield. I asked the hotel staff if that was the reason. They told me no and explained they made the change years ago because a Fengshui master told them to do so for better luck and fortune! Well, maybe the Fengshui master was right. The weird half hidden entrance makes this hotel a hidden treasure in Beijing. Apr 21 2018 	Pamper yourself at the West!	My husband and I were looking for a place to pamper ourselves for a couple of days after a 2-week long business trip to Beijing and Shanghai. We had stayed at another Marriott in Beijing and were looking to spend another 2 days at the tailend of our trip before flying out. The Marriott website showed no availability, but through Orbitz we got a great deal ($200/night) on a lavish, HUGE suite in the Beijing Marriott West -- more than worth every penny. Could not have asked for anything more comfortable and satisfying! Huge multi room suite, 2 bathrooms, soft carpeting throughout, huge comfy king-size bed with lots of soft pillows, on the 17th floor near the Executive lounge with all its perks (free internet, full breakfast, happy hour with drinks and snacks, coffee and tea available 24 hrs/day, free papers, magazines, great service), very good, polite, friendly service all around at front desk, main door, and lounge. Only downside was the overpriced and moderate quality of the hotel caffe/restaurant, though the service was thorough and respectful. Many shops and places to eat with the locals within easy walking distance of the hotel. A bit dark around the entrance and parking areas at night, and a bit out of the way, but not as bad as I had heard or imagined. Taxis are easy and very cheap all over Beijing so no problem getting anywhere you want to go across the city for well under $5 total ... we rode up to an hour in a taxi at one time and spent no more than $3 ever. Plus no tips are expected and the drivers are doing their best to learn some English in preparation for the Olympics, or at least have signs and recordings offering some English. Also, any hotel staff and doormen are happy to help explain where to go, and most hotels offer business cards with handy phrases and locations to visit written in both English and Chinese, to communicate with the drivers, etc. Great hotel and great quality for the price. We would stay there again anytime. Mar 19 2018 	Loved this Place!	I booked on marriott.com. It was my first time to Beijing, but the front desk made me feel at home. I went there last week for 4 nights, and I was tired from the time change. The front desk associate offered to help me with my bags becuase there was no bellman in sight. They were all presumably busy. The breakfast was fantastic, and the room was spotless. I called to ask the front desk for some toothpaste, and a housekeeper delivered it in 5 minutes. Great hotel! Mar 10 2018 	Spacious and attentive Marriott West	We arrived late on the last flight from Narita which put us at the hotel around 11:00 p.m. The bell staff had to be roused to help us with numerous suitcases, something we hadn't experienced with past late arrivals at different hotel chains in Beijing. But once we were at the reception desk, Simon, the desk clerk, took charge and all went according to plan. We booked a spacious suite on the Executive Floor, well worth the added expense for our five day stay.The bedroom lighting console was a puzzle at first, especially when suffering jet lag, but eventually we managed the suite's rather confusing lighting system. Except for the inattentive late evening bell staff, from maids, to the front desk, to restaurants and the ex. lounge, the staff was excellent. The breakfast buffet was just average, especially Sunday morning, but we enjoyed the choice of both Chinese and western breakfast. The BIG downside of the hotel is the fitness center and pool area. From the hotel's website, I had learned the fitness center was a Ballys but the pool area is also public and shared with 100s, seemed like 1000s, of Ballys members. No lockers were available and the locker room was really quite a mess.The staff at the fitness desk was of no help. We did not use the pool. Swimming laps and working out is an important criteria for us when booking a hotel. This experience was a big disappointment. Jan 13 2018 	Excellent Hotel	We booked an executive suite in order to relax at the end of a busy tour round Inner Mongolia. The hotel is excellent, the building and rooms immaculate, the staff - all the staff - speak English. The executive lounge was great, the staff were charming. This is the second time in 12 months we have stayed there, the last time we had Chinese guests. The hotel treated our guests in exactly the same professional and courteous manner as ourselves; this is not always the case in China in my experience - I have often found that Chinese staff in other Chinese hotels can look down on Chinese guests compared to Western ones.The staff here have that rare ability not only to say the right thing but to seem as if they genuinely mean it. They truly go out of their way to make you feel welcome.The only criticism if I was forced to make one was that the carpet in the room was synthetic which meant I got electric shocks from everything I touched until I changed my footwear!An excellent hotel, well-deserving of its 5 stars. Oct 29 2007 	Excellent Hotel - Location not great	Our stay in Beijing was all part of our package holiday with Airtours. The Marriott hotel was excellent. The room we had was amazing - huge. Some people in our party ended up with suites.There isn't a great deal to see around the hotel - there is a Pizza Hut next door and then a few shops but nothing else. You would have to get a taxi to the main parts of Beijing - but the transport is very cheap. It's worth staying here for the hotel. Breakfast was buffet style - with a huge choice. There was definately something for everyone. Oct 18 2007 	Very Good Hotel	Stayed at the hotel for 8 nights. Booked the executive floor with lounge access. The rooms are nice - the suites even nicer. My shower was not hot enough in a standard room after 2 days and was I moved to a suite with no additional charges. The lounge was good. English was at a pretty good level for the hotel staff. Food in the restaurant was good and they provided several &quot;western&quot; choices that were tasty. I'm told the Chinese restaurant provided more Cantanoese style food. The hotel manager was very nice, friendly and humouous. Over all very good place to stay. Jul 16 2007 	Nice hotel - Bad location	The hotel room was nice. Generally the hotel staff was very nice especially when it was my birthday when they sent a cake. There were two complaints that I had of the hotel.1. The bathroom was not very clean.2. The location of the hotel was not in the best area Jul 6 2007 	Beautiful clean and excellent customer service	Our family stayed at this beautiful hotel for 4 days. The staff was excellent and tended to our every need. Because we had a group of 8, we were upgraded to suites. The suites were two levels with two bedrooms, including a jacuzzi tub. The tour group they booked us with was excellent. The shows they recommended were outstanding. It is centrally located, not too far from anything we wanted to see.The food in the restaurant was delicious and safe to eat and again the staff was very accomodating. We truly enjoyed our stay and hope you will too.Frederick, Maryland, USA Apr 25 2007	Four Star Hotel Five Star Service	This hotel offers competitive rates as its location in the West of the city caters heavily to business travellers. Most tourists would probably find hotels in the center and east of the city to be more convenient.The hotel offers adequate facilities, including a Bally's Fitness Center connected to the hotel. But, it is yet to install new mattresses, linens and towels and the air-conditioning system seems to have a mind of its own. Food ranges from acceptable to very good. What sets this hotel apart is the service. Not only do the staff react quickly to your problem but they are great about following up to see that it was done promptly and correctly. This cannot be said of most hotels in Beijing or China, for that matter. Aug 18 2006 	pleasant stay	We stayed at the Marriott for 10 days. Our first 3 nights, we were in room 5015 (Make sure you don't get that room). The view is completely obstructed by a glass roof. We asked (nicely) for a change and we got another room 3 days later, on the 15th floor. The rooms are spacious and clean. The personnel was very helpful and always courteous. We were never overcharged (as I had read in some reviews) when we took a taxi directly from the hotel to the center of town vs taking a taxi down the street. Breakfast is very good. It is big buffet with a large variety of food.The health club, (Bally's) is great ! Nice, view on the city, very large, very clean, good equipement, and it is quiet even during busy hours. The hotel is a bit far from the center of town. Without traffic, it takes about 30 minutes. Overall a very pleasant stay. Aug 11 2006 	Nice clean friendly but a bit out of center	The Marriott West Beijing is a very nice hotel with 60m2 to 90m2 rooms. The suite we stayed in was very comfortable at 80m2, with a good interior design and layout. Very large bathroom. Staff very friendly and at your service 24/7. English language is a bit of a problem if you have any questions other than the weather for the staff. Concierge Diana did not give best advice when requesting information on tour or shows. The hotel is the wrong side of the city if you want the tourist areas and traps. Around the Marriott West Hotel the people of Beijing are living and eating in cheap restaurant. I would recommend this hotel. Simon &amp; Colin Executive Lounge were very nice and professional. Mar 28 2006	Good Hotel Bad Location	Our party of six had reserved two rooms and was upgraded to a nice two-bedroom suite instead. The room was big, but somewhat dated. The restaraunt was good, although a little expensive for the quality. The service was ok, but not great. The concierge service was not good.The location is the opposite side of the city from the airport and not near any attractions. Staying near Wangfuijing street would be a better idea for tourists. Mar 26 2006	Would stay again	Although slightly out of the way (not by very much), this hotel was great. The rooms were spacious and very well decorated, and the bathrooms were fabulous. The staff was extremely courteous and pleasant. Buffet breakfast was very good. My only complaint was that the rooms were slightly overheated. When we inquired, we were told that because it was Spring in Beijing, the hotel did not have the air conditioning running in the rooms. The main areas and hallways were cool. While the hotel was apologetic, there was nothing to be done. Jan 28 2006 	Excellent Service	Cannot fault the Marriott West.A long term guest (over 150 nights in the last year).The service is excellent. This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in - the rooms are huge !!The hotel is a bit out of the city centre but is easily accessible. Oct 13 2005	Fabulous hotel	If it weren't so far away from the center of city, I would say this hotel was excellent.Rooms are huge! Our room was very comfortable and cozy. Bathrooms are spacious and well lighted, also the towels were fluffy and quite large for hotel linen. Comfy bed with down pillows, and clean, clean, clean. The breakfast buffet was quite good. Lots of options both Chinese and Western, and very tasty. Free bottled water on a shelf above the salad bar. Wait staff was very attentive making sure our dirty plates didn't sit long and kept my husbands coffee cup full.The whole front desk staff were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. Two of the concierge/doormen, Alan and Jason, always made sure our taxi drivers took us to the correct address. Diane found us a great tour guide, Grace, for the Great Wall. Ming Tombs and lunch. They have a Bally's Total Fitness within the hotel and we had free access to all workout facilities and the pool. Oct 12 2005	Absolutely wonderful!!!!	It is not very close to the centre of Beijing but this hotel is modern and luxury.All the standard rooms have jacuzzi.It is very clean, comfortable and new. What else can you ask for?We were 18 in this trip and we all have the same good experience. An the taxis in Beijing are very cheap so...Highly recomended.Daniel, Madrid, Spain. Jul 27 2021 	????????? Apr 12 2018 	Hotel de 5 estrellas con un servicio pesimo"
"Oct 30 2021 	Beautiful 	This Marriott opened its doors this year and you can see it´s new. I stayed in a spacious 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom apartment. 1 room is bigger than the other and has a big walk in closet and bathroom in the room. Separate shower and bath tub, airco/ heater can be operated in all the rooms separately: bathrooms, bedrooms and living room. The windows are big, the place is very luminous, there´s a fully equipped kitchen, nice lighting, 3 flatscreen tv´s with home cinema system in the living room, dvd players, a six chair dining table, large comfortable sofa... It is the perfect venue to receive clients!It´s in the Chaoyang district, but more on the outskirts. But as you do everything with taxi or metro in Beijing, it will only take you 10min longer. From the apartments to the Marriott hotel and Ritz next to the shopping center is only 10min in taxi. Forbidden city is 30mins away. Service was also impeccable.Same day laundry (if picked up before 10am) without having to pay an extra fee.Swimming pool, wel equipped new gym, steambath, sauna,... A perfect stay in Beijing and I will definitely stay there again. I can recommend it to everyone. Business, family trip, romantic weekend,... Only downside: internet is not for free. You would expect to have free internet when you are staying in a 5 * hotel. I don´t understand why hotels still charge you for that.... Oct 10 2021 	This is the best apartment I have ever stayed in!!	This hotel is brand new, built in 2021, and is absolutely beautiful! I stayed in a 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment. It has plenty of closet space, bathtub in master bedroom, washer and dryer, fully eqipped kitchen, oven, microwave, toaster oven, rice cooker, 3 flat screen tv's (in 2 BR) and a DVD player. I believe there is free internet service in the room. But if you don't have a laptop-the rental fees for a laptop are very expensive. It also has a gym, swimming pool and hot tub, sauna and steam room. Breakfast is included, and they serve coffee, tea, omelettes, asian foods, fruit, yogurt, pasteries, bread, etc. The Sandalwood museum is across the street (the owner of the museum owns the hotel too). The location is in the Choayang district. It is a little bit further away from the center of the city. It took about 30-40 minutes to get to the Forbidden city by taxi (with traffic of course). It's about a 15-20 taxi drive away from Yashow market. Not far from the Pearl market either. There is a high end mall that the hotel recommends that has an ATM, grocery store, and good restuarants on the top floor. About 10-15 min. taxi.This apartment is extremely comfortable and roomy, you will love it."
"Nov 13 2021	Comfortable and peaceful place to say	We stayed here for 3 nights during our 5 day sight-seeing tour. From the time of our arrival to the point of departure we were served and treated with utmost courtesy and care. The facilities were just what you want after a long and hard day taking in the sights of Beijing. The breakfast, included with accommodation, was very good, full of choice and variety. The hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of the city traffic. The hotel charges, as with most Beijing hotels these days, was a bit too outlandish. (Pity). Otherwise, this hotel is the one to stay. Nov 1 2021 	Great Hotel	Cannot understand some of the other poor reviews, overall this is a great hotel.Did my research and chose this hotel from loads of others and glad I did. Got ripped off when leaving Beijing Airport from a useless taxi driver and charged £30, 3 x the normal amount. Dont use a black taxi use the ones with the price stated on the rear door , the taxi is 2 tone in colour and bottom half is red. Should cost no more than £15 and journey time 30 - 40 minutes.Make sure you have the address of this hotel in chinese script and not english as taxi drivers don't understand or call the hotel reception and get them to speak to the driver. Check in was very quick and easy with no hassle at 6:00 am. The whole hotel is set away from the main road so quite and peaceful. Rooms are first class, clean, tidy and large with very comfortable beds and pillows. Bathroom big enough and comes clean with useful extras like shampoo and toothbrush etc.Also the mini bar is not too expensive when compared to other hotels of this standard also in room tea and coffee making facility. Internet in the room is via a cable and free, YES FREE. Very modern layout and colour scheme in the rooms and throughout the hotel. They have an internet room and business centre next to reception with very good rates if you need a fax e mail etc.Good selection of food outlets and restaurants locally and also chance to buy small items coffee and milk etc. Also large retail outlet. Easy to get a bus taxi or mopped transport into city centre.Staff are very very helpful and they have good English. The biggest surprise was receiving a knock at the bedroom door at 09:00 am and I received a birthday cake to celebrate on behalf of the hotel team and management. I cannot tell you how impressed I was and so happy. Made my birthday very special indeed. THANK YOU MERCURE !!!!The hotel lies halfway between 2 metro stations and is an easy walk and safe at any time day or night. Takes about 5 - 10 minutes to walk and the once there journey time is 40 minutes downtown. Cost is only £1 return.The price was excellent and for this standard you cannot complain. You cant get a hostel in Europe for this price.The hotel restaurant is okay and have a mixed menu of meals. Tried the breakfast once and it was very disappointing cold coffee and food was so so and quite expensive.Overall, 10 out of 10 and the staff try very hard to make your stay a good one and if they dont have the answer theyll try thier best to get it. Aug 16 2021 	Second to none!!!!!	I did my homework on Tripadvisor and selected this hotel out of countless hotels in Beijing. I really hit the jackpot. The hotel is located away from the noise of Beijing streets and is a welcome place to call home after a day filled with seeing the sights. You can count on a peaceful night of rest in outstanding accommodations. The entire hotel is absolutely spotless. The gym is the envy of any gym in the USA. Great swimming pools for the kids, the most modern gym equipment and opened early in the morning until late in the evening. Also has a spa with very good rates for a massage after a tour of the Great Wall of China.The staff are helpful and make you fill right at home. They go out of their way to &quot;baby you&quot; and pamper you to ensure that your stay is first class. I have been traveling for thirty years and you can pay so much more for a hotel of this quality and still not receive the level of service. The manager, Ms. Mary Goh, is sincerely interested in the comfort of the guests so do not be surprised if you are approached by a friendly lady asking you what can be done to make your stay more enjoyable. My response was &quot;Everything is just perfect!&quot;The hotel is located about a five minute walk from the Line One on the subway. During rush hour you will get a train every ten seconds once one train leaves. During regular times every minute. You are exactly thirty minutes from The Forbidden City. The price of the subway fare is under 30 cents. More convenient than a taxi ride. The subway and trains are very clean. In fact, you will be hard pressed to even find a piece of trash on the streets in Beijing. This is the safest city I have ever been to in my life. So if you are a female traveler, you do not need to have any worries about being out late at night in the city. If you wish to take a cab remember that taxis are very inexpensive so you also have this option. I stayed at this hotel a total of eight nights. Believe me, there are so many wonderful sights and places to explore in Beijing. You really need a place to rest up after the long flight from Dallas and after each day in Beijing. The beds were comfortable with plush sheets. The rooms are large and the showers are fantastic. The value for the price is simply outstanding. Jul 3 2021 	Poor service and tired rooms	No attention to detail at this hotel. Spoke to Michael Lucas who I found pompous and condescending in his approach.I can only hope that this General Manager falls victim to the ever expanding recession. Maybe a back to basics realisation is what this Manager needs. May 20 2021 	Nice hotel but too far away from attractions for first-time tourists	Stayed at this hotel based on other reviews and the Top Value rating. We were very satisfied with the hotel and its staff, but any savings on the cost of the hotel were eaten up by the time and expense of traveling to the major attractions. Apr 30 2021	A Fantastic Place To Stay In Beijing	We spent 6 nights in Beijing as part of a tour and this hotel was fantastic. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and there were enough people who spoke English to make it easy to communicate. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning along with the beautiful view overlooking the garden behind the hotel. Each night when we returned to the hotel, our room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint was that the bed was very hard but that was the case at every hotel we stayed at in China. I think that's the way they like their beds. There were also a couple of days when they forgot to leave our 2 complimentary bottles of water but that was quickly rectified after a call to the front desk. The exercise and pool areas are second to none. I especially enjoyed the giant hot (very warm) tub with its many stations to water massage different parts of the body. I took lots of pictures and I'll try to upload as many as possible. I enjoyed the free Internet access while I was there and the desk area in the room was laid out very nicely for my laptop. Dec 10 2018	New friends!	Coming to China for the second time, I was excited about meeting more friendly people and the Mercure did not disapoint. The entire staff, from busboy and maid to front desk and general manager exceeded service and friendliness. I have traveled the world over and stayed at all the major hotels, and never have I seen such integrity, honesty, genuine smiles and just plain nice folks.Michael, the General Manager treats each guest as important--stopping to say HI in the halls or at breakfast. Allen at the front desk was so helpful. He showed my 8 year old the fish in the lobby and let him feed them. Then Allen gave my son his very own Chinese name. From that point on, all the front desk staff called him by this name--which was so special for my son.Its one thing to travel to a foreign country, see some neat sites and eat some good food...its another to make friends and feel right at home.Will I come back to the Mercure? I'm already planning my next trip! Oct 2 2018 	Fantastic Hotel	Our stay at the Mercure Wanshang hotel in Beijing was a great experience.Being of a more than reasonable price to start off, we were expecting our hotel in China to be ok with a bed and hot water (all we thought we needed); however we were surprised to find that our hotel was magnificent!!Every need was catered for; from a full business lounge where you are able to make photocopies to faxing etc; to a massive gymand heated pool; to beautiful bar and dinning areas; to stunning rooms. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, especially when explaining to a taxi driver where we wished to go.The General Manager makes his guests feel like a million dollars and is a fountain of information regarding the ins and outs of China.Thank you to all the staff for making our stay one never to be forgotten!!! Sep 25 2018 	Surprising Gem provides great value	I am writing this review on our 3rd day at the hotel - using the excellent (and free) internet connection.Before we reserved the room I did my usual search for reviews and found nothing useful. Unfortunately, the photos on the Hotel's website are generic ones from European locations that do not do justice to the beautifully finished interior.For us the location was the most important thing as we were visiting Family who live within walking distance. However, I believe that this location has advantages to any traveler. Located adjacent to &quot;ring five&quot; it is easily accessible from the airport without dealing with Beijing horrific traffic. If you are planning to travel around the city by car you will find the location very convenient. For people who want to visit the central area there is a subway station a few minutes walk away, which will take you to the Forbidden City area in about 20-30 minutes. The trains are clean and modern and arrive every minute during rush hour. One interesting surprise was the cost - 2 Yuan (down from 3 last year) for unlimited single trip. In USD it translates to less than 30 cents...As expected, the trains can be packed and seats are scarce but to people familiar with subways this is one of the best.One of the better things about the hotel is the price which is about a third of similar hotels in central Beijing. considering the free Internet and true four star quality this is a bargain package that cannot be beat.The Hotel has two restaurants - Western and Chinese - that seem very nice and we are planning on using in the near future. Surprisingly, the locals consider the Chinese restaurant one of (if not the) best in the area. We will be having a party for family and friends there.I expect to update this review later, but felt that I should post something now for the next person who looks for a review and cannot find one. Sep 22 2018 	Excellent Stay Friendly and Hospitable Staff	I had such a great stay at the Mercure Wanshang in Beijing. As an individual who has travelled to China before, it was by far the best hotel experience I've ever had. The staff was extremely hospitable and were eager to help with whatever problem I encountered. The manager, Michael, was visible at all times and made me feel very at home. You could tell he treated his staff with respect as they all were very happy to help us. Our rooms were cleaned every day, and the gym is world class!! I highly recommend staying at the Mercure when visiting Beijing!! Sep 20 2018 	Best hotel experience ever	My groups had the opportuntity to stay at the Wanshang Beijing for 22 nights during the Olympics of 2018. From the minute we checked in until the early morning hour we checked out, the entire hotel staff did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible.I'd like to give a special thanks to Michael Lucas, the GM and to Alan, one of evening bell men. And also a thanks to the bar tenders for staying up with us until all hours of the night.I highly recommend this hotel and hope that if I make it back to Beijing one day, I am able to stay here again. Apr 26 2021	Super Hotel - Schlechte Lage Jul 22 2018 	Kein POOL schlechte Lage. Gute Zimmerausstattung"
"Oct 31 2021	Clean Convenient and Cheap Price	Just at Wangfujing Street, near to subway, room was clean, service was OK, and most important --&gt; rate was not expensive!!! Sep 25 2021 	Excellent Location	Located near Beijing famous Wangfujing district, it is literally just across the road from the Wanfujingt Shopping Area. Location wise is fantastic. Close to shopping areas and public transport. Rooms are good, with free internet provided. May 23 2021 	Good Value Execllent location	This Hotel is very well located. It is not a four star hotel by any means, but the rooms are an excellent value given the location. We were traveling around China and looking for budget places to stay and this fitted well. There are shopping malls right across the street. If you like to walk you can walk to the Forbidden City and Tiananmen in about 15 minutes. The Dong Hua Men specialty night food market is lest that 5 minutes down the road.There is also the Dengshikou subway station which is a five minute walk away. There is also free internet in the room, and every time we went to the front desk for help there was always some there who spoke English, a big plus. Dec 13 2018 	Great location great value	Although not a four star hotel, it represents excellent value for money - its called motel 268 as that's the price for a basic room for 2 people. Recommend you go for the slightly higher price rooms as the basic ones are small and no windows!We paid 398RMB(about £39) for a decent size room,standard similar to premier inn. Modern in style, bathroom very nice with wetroom style large power shower, vanity unit etc. All beautifully clean, air conditioning, kettle, white bedlinen etc The hotel is part of the Merrylin chain and they do a range of motels called motel 168, but the central beijing one is a bit more expensive(website called motel168.com, but we booked through China Trip Advisor)The absolute best thing was the location - right on the corner of Wangfujing opposite Sun Dong Plaza and 2 minutes walk just across Wangfujing from the Night Market. and15 mins walk to Forbidden city. So loads of things to do ,and no taxis. Dec 10 2018 	Good Value well located	This hotel is very well located, almost directly on the corner of Wangfujing and a very diverse night food market. Within walking distance of the Forbidden city as well and metro station.But beware, the hotel is no longer as clean as the reviews lead one to believe. I am confused on how this is considered to be a new(er) hotel. The corridors are dirty and carpets with holes and many stains on most floors.The trick to enjoying this hotel is to realize that they have 4 classes of rooms (D,C,B,A). I would completely write off D and C as they are very dirty and tiny, it would seem that they receive a large amount of visitors and are not well kept. The B room is very clean, much larger and only $10USD more. I spend the first night in a C and changed over to a B for the next 5 nights of my stay, didn't even see the need to look at the A class.Breakfast is also included in most rates. If you are not on a corporate plan, they sell a &quot;club card&quot; for 50 that will give you a discount of 10 per night, which would only be worth it if you stay for more than 5 nights.Overall, it is very good value and clean if you select a Class B or A room. Nov 19 2018 	Nice Hotel	Third time staying at this hotel. Location is superb and the rooms are clean and functional. Only set back is the size of the room. Some rooms do not have a wardrobe ( a pity). On the whole, value for money. Jun 5 2018 	Fantastic.. Great value!	Fantastic new hotel. Excellent location next to brand new shopping mall and shopping street in Wangfujing. Rooms are not big but functional, very clean, have comfortable beds and modern bathroom. Though it is next to the main street, the windows are really soundproof. We could just cross the road and get all the food and shopping we want. Also short walk to train/metro station. They even have a DIY washer and dryer for 10yen per wash/dry, with washing detergent provided. Definitely excellent value for money... they have rooms to cater for budget travellers if you don't mind having no windows. Though the only problem was because it is right in the city square so cabs are not allowed to stop in front of the hotel from 9am to 5pm but it is not a major issue because they can stop across the road behind the shopping mall and you can also catch a cab some 50m walk from the hotel. Highly recommended!"
"Nicely remodelled executive floors but toxic burning rubber smell made us think twice	All in all this is a pretty good hotel, the public spaces have been remodeled very nicely as well as the executive floors. The rooms were very nice on those floors, comfortable and clean. The only real problem was an extremely strong burning rubber smell in the hallways of those executive floors. It was so strong we had to run to the room covering our mouths. It was present in the room as well, but not too bad once you stuck a towel under the door. We brought it up to the staff, but as expected, they just shrugged and said it's not a problem. That worries me, they really don't seem to be concerned about details like toxic smells. Oct 9 2021 	Excellent experience	We stayed New World Hotel for 3 nights and liked it a lot. Their complimentary breakfast was they perfect way to start my day and features a variety of breakfast foods including: a bowl of noodle, fried rice, porridge, omelet, sausage, bacon, danish, toasts, cereals, yogurt and fresh fruits and much more. Also they served a variety of drinks such as coffee, tea, milk and fruit juice. The room was very clean and we were lucky to have the corner room which came with a large window and a beautiful view of the city. There is a small grocery store inside of the hotel where locates the same floor as the swimming pool. The prices are not as bad as I thought. All in all, we liked this hotel and will stay here again. Oct 8 2021 	Excellent Hotel good location highly recommended	The hotel is a little out of the way in the Chaoyang District, near the Chaoyang theater (right across the street). Easy access to the subway and 10 minute ride subway to Silk Market, maybe 15 minute to Tiananmen Square. The hotel is very nice, modern rooms with LCD TV's. The breakfast buffet was excellent as well, especially suited for foreigners. I personally like the street food outside for 2 Yuan, it's the real taste of Beijing. There is a small grocery market near by if you need any snacks. One special note about the hotel is that there is a convenience store on the 7th floor (one with the pool) and the price is not that far from the local market, Tsing Tao Beer for $4 yuan per bottle... Jun 3 2021 	New experience that gave me a bit of a different view	Last May I stayed in the New World hotel again. This time I stayed in one of the 2 room apartments on the 9th floor. First time I stayed on one of the executive floors and was very pleased with that room.This room was very different. It was not refurbished for a long time. Although the rooms were clean, they looked a bit dusty. Both rooms had (working) airco. The little kitchen was OK. I only used the fridge. Also the bed room was OK. The only minor point was that the internet connection was in the bedroom and not in the living room. Both rooms had a new television. On my request they also placed a dvd player in the room.The only major negative point was that the power outlets were UK style oulets, while I brought the new Chinese plug converters (EU -&gt; Chinese). The hotel only wanted to supply me one converter and no extension cable.The bathroom was big and clean. Only the warm water regulator in the sink was not working in the way it should. But that was not a big deal.In general the service was OK. Jun 1 2021 	Modern Well Located Hotel	Having refurbished its lobby, dining facilities and executive floors the hotel now offers a reasonably priced five star hotel in a great location in the CBD, providing you stay on the executive floors. Hopefully they will upgrade the other floors soon so it can compete with the extensive under-performing hotels in Beijing May 29 2021 	Hotel room advertising photos must have been taken when they first opened - don't reflect today's condition	I was horrified that our 5 star hotel was about the same quality of a no-name motel you might pull into in the middle of the night on the side of the highway. The lobby is nice, but we had to change rooms 3 times. They first put us in a 2 bedroom suite on the 9th floor. HA. I can't even begin to explain this suite. Definitely not one of the renovated ones. We're talking a fridge from the late 60s maybe and thread bare blankets. So we moved into another room. Just a regular room. It was filthy. Nail clippings and food on the floor at the end of the bed. Not just little specks but food chunks. The a/c was broken. The carpet may as well have been green shag, it was so old. It reeked of smoke. They came to look at the room when I called to complain and didn't even apologize for the dirty room. Called a maid in and when she argued with the manager that she had cleaned the room, he pointed out the floor. I was horrified. They moved us to the top floor, supposedly executive floor, and the room was tolerable. Same carpet, semi-updated bathroom, extremely stale smoke lingered, just disgusting. Decent breakfast buffet with wonderful service at breakfast. Concierge was helpful and polite. Front desk girls were slow and unhelpful with the rooms. Check-in took a long time. We might as well have thrown money out the smoke-sealed windows, it was such a waste. I would never stay here again. Feb 20 2021 	Good value	I stayed at the New World for two nights in a standard room. Although this hotel has had less than flattering reviews from its time before the Olympics but since it was renovated it has certainly picked up. The lobby is very bright and modern and is a welcoming sight on arrival. The check in process was simple and handled well by the friendly staff. The room was unremarkable but still very clean and comfortable with all the various facilities provided. The internet was free and fast. When I needed an iron and board they were promptly and politely delivered.. Since I did not have the meal option I did not use the cafe in the morning but one could see they certainly had all the facilities to provide a substantial buffet. Considering that I checked out at 9 AM (peak period) they could have had one more cashier on the job but nonetheless it was still fairly quick. All in all a comfortable stay and still within walking distance of China Trade Center and numerous other restaurants and hotels. Feb 6 2021 	Never again	At first impression, the hotel looks great. The lobby is newly refurbished - obviously for the Olympics. Upon entering their premises there were no bell boys and several people waiting to check-in and out at around 12pm. Their service was slow and at one point in time there were no staff at reception. I then took my luggage to my room and found that the rooms were not refurbished - only the lobby. The room suffers from poor lighting and bad ventilation. There was no hot water in either the basin or bath - just lukewarm, which really is unacceptable. The blow dryer was so weak that I might as well let my hair air dry. I also tried room service because there was nothing around the hotel. I ordered a club sandwich, which was tasteless and had no avocado even though it was listed in the menu. Overall, a very disappointing experience. I checked out after the first day despite original plans to stay for 2 nights. Oct 4 2018 	Completely Refurbished	I booked this room in June for two nights as I had gotten some corporate tickets to one day/night event at the Olympics. At that time, bookings were tough and rates were high. I paid rmb 5,0000 per night. Needless to say, as we got closer to the games, rates in general dropped like a stone.Some history on this hotel. It's one of the original 5 star hotels in Beijing and probably about 15 years old. In China, that's like dog years. It has been completely refurbished inside and outside including the rooms and common areas. They've actually done a good job and it's relatively tasteful. We got upgraded, no kidding, to a corner room and had a great view of the new CCTV building, known to locals as &quot;big shorts.&quot; If you ever see a picture of the building, you'll understand. The room was very nice, quiet and had all mod cons. Breakfast for the executive rooms was served on floor 2 or 3 in a very nice and quiet room. The hotel may have had very low occupancy due to their pricing policy and difficulties foreigners had in getting visas.The hotel is located near the the financial district and a good alternative to some of the higher priced options in this area such as the Four Seasons. It is also located right by a station for the number 10 underground line. Linking up to many of the sights can be done with greater ease than in the past. In the past 3 years, Beijing has added two additional subway lines, both of which go North and South, plus the airport line which is quite convenient given bad Beijing traffic.At their normal pricing, I'd recommend this hotel. I still prefer the Crowne Plaza in Dongcheng district but this one is better value, especially if you're traveling with family or on a budget. Jul 28 2018 	OK business hotel	Stayed at this Asian-businessman-type hotel at the suggestion of the Chinese tourist agency who arranged for our family of 5 first trip to China. The lobby is on the 3rd floor of an office building. You need to change elevator banks on that floor to reach the rest of the building. A little odd; but you get to interact with office workers as they go in to work...The week we arrived (July 5 2018) they were renovating the lobby and it looks lots better. The rooms are clean and new, though far from luxurious. The hotel (as most others in China) provide free bottled water in the bathroom (still can't drink the water yet if you are not Chinese...). We opted for the breakfast plan - which was good since otherwise we would have walked a long while for breakfast (or gotten something on the road - a vendor sells breakfast at the corner). The breakfast buffet was very good - providing both western and Asian food including made to order omlets). The big plus to the breakfast (we also had two good dinners there) at the hotel was the view -- the upper floor restaurant overlooks the magnificent China TV tower -- a six million plus square foot chair-like building that was just being completed as we ate our breakfast...Unfortunately I do not know how convenient the hotel was to the sites as we were picked up by our tour guide and driven from place to place. However, since the hotel is close to Beijing's World Trade Center, I can imagine it is a good location for business people.The staff speaks English fairly well - but it took 5 of them to check us in (blame the complicated Chinese regulations requiring laborious copying of passports and filling out of forms). Everyone was gracious and perfectly groomed with uniform like outfits. Nov 26 2006	Very disappointing	As a part of a tour group, we stayed in this desperately in need of a facelift hotel. The lobby is very grand, but it is the only part of the hotel that has received any attention in recent years. When we looked at our first room, there were cigarette burns and watermarks all over the thin carpet. It was obvious the carpet hadn't been vacuumed recently. Though we had requested a non-smoking room, we couldn't be accommodated. Our second room wasn't much of an improvement; the one positive was a recent vacuuming. It is not well-located as there is no nightlife nearby, making a cab ride a necessity. The breakfast buffet was poor with limited offerings, and the food was never hot. Tablecloths and chair covers often had stains. When a hotel uses the fact that it is the tallest in the city as its greatest claim to fame, that is not a good sign. Our entire group had the same concerns about this reputed five star hotel. Avoid at all costs. Sep 24 2006 	Good hotel with good location	Good hotel with a good location for shopping and dinning. The service is acceptable. English speaking staff, very friendly and courteous. Although the hotel is a little bit expensive for the room rate compared to the service and quality resp. cleanliness, but the rooms are acceptable and comfortable. Even the smoking rooms. The bed is clean and comfortable. The rooms look like they have never been reconditioned, that is the only disadvantage. The bar resp. cafe downstairs in the Lobby is quite nice and a good meeting place. The hotel staff and the waitresses/waiters are also very nice and friendly. The check-in is ok, so far. All in all a acceptable place to stay, with a acceptable service. Recommendable. The only real disadvantage at the time of my stay was the internet connection. Dial-up connection with a 56k modem. That was lousy. Don't know, whether they still have it or not. Mar 29 2006 	There is much better in Beijing	I actually stayed a few months at this hotel which is by the way the tallest building in town. For sure it's the one liked the least in Beijing. The rooms are not anything near 5 stars with their worn out carpet and tired furniture. The gym was acceptable but not what one would expect from a 5 star hotel. Service was very good, as in every hotel in China.With so many nice hotels I can't see why one would choose this one. Mar 22 2006	Not 5 Star But not terrible	I stayed for a week at the Jing Guang New World Hotel, in 2 different rooms (one on the 8th floor, the other on 21). The rooms were in about the same condition, which was not great. It appears that nothing has been replaced since the opening of the hotel. So, everything is worn, dirty, stained, etc. One trivial item is that each night we would have 5 or 6 business cards of not so reputable massage parlors stuck under our door. You would think a &quot;5 star&quot; hotel would be able to deal with that. The lobby and lobby bar are both very nice. The Japanese restaurant in the basement is pretty good, too. The gym is large, but the equipment is outdated. Sep 13 2005	Not quite 5 stars but...	My stay in this hotel had good and bad points...As some people have said here, the room was the low point. The room was generally clean but the carpet was badly in need of replacement, matted and soiled probably beyond any cleanability. The bathroom was generally clean but not all the rust stains were gone from the tub corners. The sheets were clean so that was good.The service was generally good--we really appreciated the business center's fast, efficient work in getting us air and train tickets for the further legs of our trip--a big help since we had had trouble negotiating the process for getting Chinese air and train reservations on our own (it's a weird system where a credit card can't get you a guaranteed reservation...). That's where the hotel lived up to its five star rating.The hotel offers a great wall tour service that it seemed to be the bellmen's job to sell. Consequently, they weren't very helpful in advising us about other ways to get to the great wall (e.g. the public bus service).Some of the charges in this hotel are definitely up to five star caliber--drinks from the mini-bar were 40-45 RMB, and getting 3 T shirts, 2 pairs of jeans, 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of underwear laundered cost me a whopping 360 RMB--about US$45. Jun 16 2005	What to see	Spent five nights in Beijing at the Jing Guang New World Hotel. Excellent. Of course you have to see Tiananmen Square and Forbidden City. What ever you want to buy from the &quot;hawkers&quot; cut the price down to one third or less. Hats, postcards, some were selling for 2 and 3 for one dollar.The books on the area I am not really sure, but bargain, bargain. Take in an Opera, its not like anything you can imagine, but worth going to see. Take the Hutong tour and you may also get to visit with one of the families that live there. The family we visited has been there for years and it was wonderful hearing about who lived there. The Great Wall was unbelievable, prepare for a walk, a tough walk. And again &quot;the hawkers&quot; and stands selling there. Bargain, Bargain. A visit to the Summer Palace and the Panda place was worth the trip. Some out of the way places, Pearl Shopping Building and also a place our guide called The Knockoff Store. Both great deals, but Bargain, Bargain. One thing I noticed it was hard to get a Cold Beer. But finally found TGI Friday, that advertised &quot;cold beer&quot; and it was. A great trip. jonbarb709@juno.com May 3 2005	rooms were average	The rooms were at least 4 star. We stayed 3nights and rooms were clean, with no problem of soiled carpet or worn bedspreads. The bathroom was stocked with amenities, ex. shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste. etc. The only draw back with this hotel is, it deals with large groups of tourists. The buffet breakfast was included in the price and it was ok, fruits, yogurts, cererals, danish pastries, bacon, sausages, pancakes, eggs. And of course the staff is always helpful. Overall this hotel was ok. Jan 4 2005	Rooms far from 5 star	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights en-route to southern China. It is rated as 5 star and it is fair to say that the reception area/lobby, lifts etc are very nice indeed and give the impression of 5 star quality. However the rooms are far from 5 star - in fact I have stayed in 3 star hotels in China that have had better rooms. The carpets were worn and dirty and the beds were soft and worn. Worst of all were the bedspreads which were filthy and threadbare. Fortunately these can be dispensed with and the bedding underneath (sheets and duvet) were clean. Had I paid full price for this room I would have been very unhappy indeed! Oct 26 2021 	????????????? Sep 4 2021 	??????????? Aug 23 2021 	???????????????????? Aug 20 2021 	??????????????????????

"Oct 23 2018 	OK But Old Service Average	Overall: Not too expensive by Beijing standards. Decent clean rooms but showing its age everywhere. Can probably find better places to stay that are more central.Location/Access: About 5 minutes and RMB10 by taxi west of Xizhimen station. Note that you can't realistically walk to the hotel from the subway. There isn't much immediately around the hotel although as others said, Carrefour is right across the main street. Taxi directly from the airport would likely cost about RMB80-90 and take about 40 minutes.Lobby: Huge marbled lobby although the reception is not immediately obvious. The public areas really need to be renovated. Many places, such as the elevator area, have chipped paint or chrome. The deco, especially the light colored wood panels, is like a rewind to the early 90's.Rooms: Decent size and comfortable colors. Lighting is too dim overall even with all the lights on. Beds are firm and comfortable. Old style TV with mostly Chinese channels for selection. Two small bottles of free water provided although the ones at the mini bar were a whopping RMB36. A/C never got cool and felt more like a fan. Very small built-in alarm clock. Overall, could use renovation as well. Requested non-smoking but could only get smoking room. Smell was faint though so ok.Food: Tried the cafe at the ground level and the food was expensive and very average. Breakfast is served at the function room on the 4th floor with huge round tables covered by old pink/orange tablecloth so you sit with people you don't know. The entire breakfast room setting seemed very out-of-date although the food is halfway decent. However, if you have had buffets in Hong Kong or Thailand hotels, this one pales by comparison. Breakfast simply didn't feel comfortable due to the setting.Service: Ok but not particularly friendly. They seemed to frown a bit when they couldn't understand you or vice versa.Value for money: The rate was around USD130 for a single with breakfast. Double occupancy would have given me the same room except breakfast would have cost another USD10. The rate is reasonable by Beijing standards although you can stay more central at a similar price. Jun 14 2018 	From Califronia	We booked the Nikko through RCI time share and felt we received excellent value. We were concerned beacuse the hotel wasn't in the center of town but loved the location. We were only a 10-15 minute taxi ride from the Old Quarter costing 2-3 US$. The Nikko must have done some redecorating since reviews were written in 2016. We found the hotel to be very pretty and our room which was spacious was very tastefully appointed. Counldn't have asked for a better breakfast. Asian and Western food were in abundance with good quality. Evening meals in the 2 restaurants were delicious with a wide variety to choose from. The bell staff, concierges and front desk staff all spoke very good English and took care of all our needs. The peanuts they serve in the bar and the Asian restaurant before dinner were the most delicious I have ever eaten. We took an overnight trip to Halong Bay which should not be missed. Overall our experiences in Hanoi and the Nikko were one of the best trips we've ever taken. We highly recommend both. We found the Vietnam people to be the most polite and friendly people we have ever met. Apr 20 2018 	Nice enough	Stayed at the New Century with my wife who was on business. When the job ended, we stayed in Beijing for an extra week but moved to a much cheaper, three-star hotel (Beijing Shatan) that we liked better (particularly its location). Our New Century room was spacious by Beijing standards, though a bit shabby in spots (smudges on the wall, frayed spots on the carpet, etc.). Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The staff was friendly and helpful, and many spoke fairly good English. The breakfast buffet was quite amazingly comprehensive (Western, Japanese and Chinese choices). I used the gym a couple of times -- it was well equipped and almost completely empty.Don't even touch the New Century's outrageously overpriced minibar goods, which are expensive even by Western standards (including $7 Tibetan bottled water). Make a trip across the expressway (using the pedestrian walkway) and visit the Carrefour -- a French-owned department/grocery store for snacks and supplies. It's one of the most useful shopping spots in Beijing. A double-sized bottle of beer at the Carrefour will set you back less than 50 cents.If you're travelling on a five-star budget, you might check out other alternatives. If you're at all careful of your money, you can do better. But there's no particular reason to avoid the New Century. Apr 16 2018 	skanky flophouse with a marble lobby	OK, I travel a lot, and I stay in a lot of hotels, and I'm not particularly hard to please. But this hotel, which was booked for me by a customer, was one of the most disappointing I've ever stayed in. You would expect a good experience from a Nikko hotel, wouldn't you? With this &quot;property&quot; you can probably expect one or more of the following: a.) dead bugs in the bathroom; b.) stinky plumbing; c.) matted hair in the drains; d.) filthy mirrors and surfaces that you don't want to touch; e.) stained carpet; f.) poor, stale, smoky ventilation; g.) thin walls; h.) banged up furniture; i.) TVs that don't work; j.) burned-out light bulbs; k.) surly non English-speaking service; l.) holed, cracked, gouged, chipped, scuffed walls that don't even meet up with the moldings; m.) cracked and mildewed tiles missing grout; n.) a strange, inconvenient location; o.) banged-up furniture; p.) do you need any other reasons to NOT STAY HERE??Let's just imagine one of your typical interstate motels with a big fluorescent sign out front for $49.99 per night with &quot;color TV&quot; and &quot;air conditioning&quot;. You take that, you add like 30 floors to it, throw a fancy lobby on to it, put it in China and there you have the Nikko New Century. There are gazillions of other options in Beijing that are way better. If you have to go with a tour group, fine. But for heavens sake, don't stay here if you don't have to. Mar 1 2018 	Nice enough hotel	We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour for 2 nights. The lobby looks beautiful, but then you quickly come to learn that there aren't any places to sit and wait for people, which is a little inconvenient. The hotel rooms themselves were nice, but it seems as if the cleaning crew missed a few spots of mildew here and there in the bathroom.The swimming pool is just kind of gross...with hot and cold spots. It probably wouldn't have seemed so terrible if it weren't freezing outside. The changing rooms and locker rooms aren't very easy to navigate, and there are a bunch of rules that you wouldn't get (like having to wear communal slippers to the pool) if you didn't speak Chinese.Overall it was a nice place to stay, but if I were to come back to Beijing on my own, I'd probably look into other options Dec 21 2017	Lovely start to our vacation	We were placed in this lovely hotel by Princess Cruises prior to our cruise. The hotel is in a very good location, superb common areas and lovely bedrooms. We took an excellent tour from the hotel, bus with super guide, pedicars, Chinese home and studio, the Olympic stadium, great Chinese banquet and night tour, all for £25!I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Bejing Dec 7 2017 	O.K. for one night	Lovely public areas and very helpful staff. Polite waitresses in the lounge area too, but this wouldn't get a five star rating elsewhere. The room was clean but looked tired. Wallpaper ws beginning to peel off and the carpet had a few stains. The tiles in the bathroom needed either replacing or a good scrub. I stayed for one night with my wife prior to flying out of Beijing airport and it was O.K. for that, but I wouldn't want to stay for any length of time. Nov 9 2017 	Tourist class hotel/dingy rooms	We stayed here for 4 nights in November while attending a conference. A very beautiful lobby was as a quite misleading opening to the rooms. The hallways are bland and unappealing. Although clean, the room is extremely small for two people, the rug was old, mattress hard and uncomfortable, bathroom had granite counter but floor and bathtub need cleaning and along with a stained shower curtain. Fortunately, we were busy all day so we only had to spend evening hours here. It calls itself a five star hotel but what I found out about China is that once one earns this rating it is never re-evaluated. This may have been a 5-star 20 years ago but it is barely a 2-3 star today.On the positive side, the catering for the conference was excellent. In addition, the staff is very responsive to the customer, e.g., we had a problem with our TV and someone came to the room in less than 1 minute. Any other similar requests were handled in the same manner. It was as if someone was positioned on each floor to respond immediately. So, Kudos to them for excellent customer service!Perhaps it is ungrateful to complain because our room and board were being paid for by Peking University as speakers at the Beijing Forum and we appreciated this very much. Oct 12 2017	Better than I expected	Stayed our first 4 nights in China here and found the hotel to be far better than I expected. The room was very clean, nice bathroom, tea and coffee making facilities (a little tight with the coffee sachets), bottles of drinking water supplied daily. View on the 6th floor was a little obscured but able to see a lot of high rise buildings. Breakfasts were very good (buffet) and the buffet dining room we used was excellent with a good range of dishes. Swimming pool available, bank facilities, shops, postage stamps available.Staff were very helpful.We were very happy with this hotel and have no hesitation in recommending it to others. Aug 24 2017	Worst 5-star hotel	Hotel is definitely about 3-4 stars. Public areas OK but rooms small, and carpets dirty. Our first night there, when we first turned on the water in the bathroom sink, the color was yellowish and had sewage smell with no hot water. The water eventually cleared out but the stinky sewage smell was still there. We had to switch to a different room. The breakfast is ok but the worst we have seen for a 5-star hotel. We would not stay there again. Jul 6 2017 	Very stylish; some flaws	Stayed four nights at the Hotel Nikko New Century. My room was very clean and stylish, with a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was very nice. The shower was a circular area outside the tub with a sliding door. Water pressure was great. Refrigerator and coffee supplies were nice, but the electricity goes off when you leave the room (key activated), so had difficulty keeping things cold.On the down side, the room was very small, with paper thin walls (think hearing your neighbor brush his teeth) , and no drawers for clothing. The lobby is very nice, with shops and restaurants, and a bank for currency exchange. There is a store with supplies and groceries within walking distance, and US type food as well (KFC, Pizza Hut).It was very nice, but the room-to-room noise is quite annoying. May 4 2017 	Excellent Executive Floor Room	I was at this hotel for business. The room was very comfortable and functional for working. Because this room was on the Executive Floor, internet access was free. Other amenities included a fax machine, flat panel TV, a safe, light switches for all lights in the room in several places in the room (like right above the nightstand), separate shower and bathtub, and free water. There was a large window between the bedroom and bathroom that had blinds, if needed.The room rate included a full breakfast in the lobby restaurant or a continental breakfast in the Executive floor business center. Services in the business center (except food) were quite expensive - you had to pay a lot (I've forgotten how much now) to print something from one of their computers. Beside a continental breakfast in the morning, there were snacks and free wine/beer in the afternoon.The lobby was immaculate and very attractive. There are several restaurants in the hotel. I ate twice at the traditional Chinese restaurant , called the Golden Palace Restaurant, on the third floor. The prices in this restaurant were very reasonable, and the food and service were excellent. Apr 29 2017 	beige palace	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in April for a conference. The Nikko claims to be a five star but is pushing it to be a three star unlike the Shangri La nearby which is a genuine 5 star. The Nikko has begun renovation on the upper floors but I had a suite on the 8th floor. The room are shabby and generally pretty grubby with very worrying stains on the carpet and the shower floor. The rooms are permeated with the smell of cigarette smoke and even though you can partly open the windows it cannot be shifted. The rooms while providing instant coffee provide only jasmine tea in the home of tea drinking and they found the whole idea of providing free milk for a cup of coffee in your room very novel indeed! The rooms are large but depressingly beige with no low level lamps or 5 star room dressing features like throw cushions or paintings to soften the almost dormitory like decor. Everything is worn and sad looking. The hotel is in the business district and not close to any of the tourist sights. The views from the hotel are of rather dirty and run down office blocks. The restuarants leave much to be desired with very ordinary food [including the Chinese menu] and the attitude to service is sloppy, unsmiling and unwelcoming. I did not encounter anyone in the hotel who spoke english beyond the words 'bill' and 'pay', certainly not 'thank-you'.The business centre is ruinously expensive and charged 12 yuan per page if you printed anything out. In addition, while there were plenty of staff in the business centre they were much more interested in having long loud gossipy chats with each other in Chinese rather than being helpful. The noise level also made it very difficult to concentrate in the centre. All up I would say that there are much better located and more stylish hotels for the same price with a better developed service culture for western business or tourim visitors. Unless your like beige and guessing what may have caused the mystery stains in every room - give it a miss and run, do not walk, to the Shangri La down the road. Nov 9 2016	Good Not Great	Our tour group stayed there the first three nights of our trip. While not a true 5 star hotel, this is certainly a nice place with comfortable, though fairly small rooms. The beds were good and the bathroom was adequate but there was no comfortable chair and the television only brought in two English language stations. The lobby was magnificent. The breakfast was about average for Chinese hotels serving western food. The hotel was not centrally located though it made little difference to us since the tour bus picked us up in the morning. Aug 7 2016 	Better than expected	Our first night's stay was provided by a cruise line and rather than change hotels we simply extended our stay to four days. Initially we were assigned a smoking room on the 12th floor. The hotel has limited non smoking rooms and changing rooms created a few difficulties. My only language is English but found this presented no problems. Both the smoking room and the non smoking room were identical. They are about the size of an average US motel room. Amenities include all the usual plus a safe, scale, hair dryer, and a mini bar with a kettle. The closet was minimal size. The hotel was recently updated with one exception, the carpets. Both rooms and all carpeted areas throughout the hotel, including the elevators, need recarpeting or a good steaming at the very least. If you can overlook them the rest of the hotel decor is quite nice although it would be nice to have a few chairs in the large lobby. The location is not particularly good for the tourist as the hotel is some distance from the city center. . Aug 1 2016 	Good business hotel	Arriving at the Nikko Beijing around midnight, I could have used some help getting my bags to the front desk, but no working bellhops were in sight. The young man at the kerb just stared at me - perhaps they are not used to seeing a woman show up at a business hotel dressed in motorcycle leathers. But, my leathers are the warmest things I own, and I get quite chilled on the long distance flights. The young lady at the desk was polite and efficient, and got me checked in and summoned a youngster who got my bags to my room and helped me knock a little of the rust off my Chinese. Apparantly I speak with a slight Cantonese accent - not surprising, as most Hawai`i Chinese are. . . . Cantonese! I really like the breakfast buffet, which came with the room. Good, basic food, just like grandma used to make. Two kinds of jook (congee) every day, condiments, lots and lots of fruit, two to four kinds of bao (stuffed steamed breads), noodles, lots of juices, yoghurt, tea, coffee, and American food.  I don't know how the American food was, personally, but my fellow conference attendees enjoyed it. I did a lot of my business by just showing up early and nibbling through the entire breakfast service as different contacts came and went. The supper buffet also was nice, though at 130 kwai (RMB), a bit pricy, IMO. The hot pot restaurant down the street only charges 150 kwai for a meal for three people. But it had a good selection of yummies, sliced small enough that one could sample a bite of everything, plus a nice sushi bar. Wine, beer, and sake were included. The room was tidy, though the carpet sould have been replaced some ten years ago. It took two days for the laundry service to figure out I wanted laundry service, and by then I had washed everything in the bathtub. It's all good. I saved a few kwai. I found the staff friendly and helpful. Most spoke decent English and were very good about not laughing at my atrocious Mandarin, and even put up with my incessant questions on vocabulary and pronunciation. Checkout was friendly and efficient. The doorman hailed me the only cab around at 4:00 am and gave me a little yellow slip with the cabbie's license number. It has instructions in Chinese and English to give it the hotel if you have problems with the cabbie.  I'll be mailing it to the hotel with a reccomendation to ban that cabbie from the place. He ripped me off 20 kwai for the toll booth - toll charges are included in the fare - and refused to give me a receipt. You don't have time to fight when you have a plane to catch. You should pay 100 to 130 RMB - 150 absolute tops - between the Nikko and the airport.  If I had business again in that area, I would not hesitate to book with the Nikko New Century Beijing. Jul 27 2016 	Very Nice Hotel	Stayed for four nights at end of June and must disagree with previous lukewarm reviews. I found the public areas of the hotel to be in excellent condition; my business class room was comfortable and in superb condition. The bed was fabulous! Staff was helpful when asked, but thankfully did not hover around you as in so many other places in China. I rented the doorman's bicycle and rode throughout Beijing for a morning -- what a trip! Jun 10 2016	Not terribly impressed	This hotel of the Nikko Hotel chain provides all amenities that you would expect of this group and class. However, the overall impression is a bit lower than other Nikko hotels in Asia. The rooms would greatly benefit from a renovation - or at least from a proper cleaning (cutains and floor). Internet connection (wireless) worked without problem and the staff was generally friendly and helpfu - although English skills are generally low. But after all it is China...Would recommend the hotel to anyone who is on business and needs to be at the nearby exhibition centre. Otherwise there are certainly nicer locations and hotels, particularly if on vacation. Feb 23 2016 	Above average for a 4* meeting hotel not a palace.	I stayed at the hotel for a conference. The equipment are good: large swimming pool, well stocked occidental bar and oriental tea parlour. Have to agree with all the previous comments that this is not a palace : The toilet seat is in the bathroom, soundproofing is less than perfect. Rooms are not large, but I enjoyed a lot the view from the 22th floor. As for the location, it's far from the big tourist places but taxi is cheap. There are plenty of restaurants around, starting at Y4 (four yuan) for a bowl of noodles soup. The Carrefour across the street stocks a good selection of teas on the lower floor, and has a special outlet in the mall gallery for the more fancy ones. The most expensive are of course in the hotel. Expect beer around Y50, and tea from Y80 to Y200 (yes, it is very good tea).By all means, avoid the Great Wall tour with the hotel agency (Hualong International Travel Service) if you don't want to do the &quot;jade factory&quot; and the &quot;chinese clinic&quot; tourist traps. Any other travel agency will be happy to pick up at the hotel.Minh Dec 6 2005	Seen better days....	Hotel has seen better days. Public areas OK but rooms shabby and small, I still have no idea where exactly this hotel was located, it did not seem close to anything. Took cabs everywhere. Plenty of good five star hotels in this city that you can give this one a miss. Wde would not stay there again. Oct 28 2005	Not a five star	The hotel stay at the new century was a part of the cruise line operational package. Service is resonable, but I would not call it a five star. Three is more appropiate.When our bus arrived, there was absolutley no bell service, we had to drag our luggage from the bus to our room. I cannot recall any hotel staff ever come up to greet us during our entire stay. As the room was rather stuffy, we turned on the air conditioning only to find out that the chiller was not operatiional that time of the year. We only had air circulation and was told to open our window if we need more. Oct 24 2005	Great value for the money	The New Century is a 5 star modern hotel in Beijing's west end near the Panda Zoo and the Purple Bamboo Park. Would like to have been closer to the centre but transportation is reasonable (Taxi to Tiennamen Square 30 yuan, to the silk market 50 yuan). Staff at the New Century are competent,friendly and extremely helpful. Always willing to help you out or give you the directions you need. An excellent concierge staff as well. The on-premises pool and health club are excellent too. Standard rooms are good sized and comfortable. If you have breakfast included, it is both Western and Asian (buffet style). There is a need to get the Omelette station some more choices (cheese and ham would be nice), but I quibble. Supper at the hotel can be quite reasonable with a Western and Asian Buffet starting at 110 Yuan plus 15% service(includes all the beer and softdrinks you want as well). The weekend buffet was 135 yuan and featured Japanese fare.Hint for the budget conscious. There is a Carrefoure store just across from the hotel . Ideal to buy those snacks you might miss/find too pricey, in the hotel room; or, get some supplies for a picnic lunch. It's good if you forgot some necessities and want to replace them. No bargaining allowed.We were at several other 4-5 star hotels in China during our stay but this was one of the best. Nov 15 2009 	?????????? Oct 31 2009 	???????????????????? Oct 31 2009 	????

"Nov 6 2021 	Excellent Place to Stay	This is an excellent place to stay if you need a clean and comfortable bed, nice and fully equipped kitchen and laundry machine. It is very spacious. Beware though, most taxi drivers cannot find the place as the hotel is located inside the street,. The breakfast is really nothing just enough to fill your stomach. There were some unfriendly voices on the phone by some receptionists on my first day but I got excellent service on the rest of my stay. Everything were provided including water but there was no dishwasher soap to my surprise. The internet is extra $15 or 100 yuan a day and I would rather have free internet than free minimal breakfast. The restaurant food was also not good for my taste. But overall, this apartment hotel is excellent based on the room alone. Oct 29 2021 	Highly Recommended	My husband, daughter and I stayed in the Oakwood Residence for a month and a half while looking for a more permanent residence in Beijing. The rooms/flats are large and comfortable, the location is terrific, and the services (breakfast, spa, gym) are all very good. Perhaps if you are staying for one week as a tourist you might want a fancier restaurant or elegant furnishings. But if you're staying for longer than a week, this is the place. It's very comfortable.The highlight however has been the staff. The customer service has been exceptional. All staff are very friendly and helpful. And if you are not a Chinese speaker having the assistance of a capable team can make all the difference.I would recommend the Oakwood to anyone planning a long term stay in Beijing, and I would absolutely stay here again. Oct 24 2021 	If you are looking for hotel quality service stay away!	I booked Oakwood through Expedia due to the description, and thought it was going to be not much different from other hotels. Well, the rooms are large but the front desk service is poor. It took me more than an hour just to check in. If you are a foreigner, they register your passport with the local police, and the process takes 4 hours. It was a unpleasant surprise. Oct 6 2021 	Clean Comfortable and Value For Money	We booked 2 x one-bedroom apartments at Oakwood Residence. Apartments consisted of fully equipped kitchen, brand new appliances, utensils never used, spotless. Separate living and bedroom, large bathroom and separate laundry with additional toilet.This place is great value for money, the bed and pillows has to be (one of) the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Staff are very professional and friendly. Having stayed in apartment hotels before I have often found that breakfast can be a disappointment, no such thing at Oakwood, breakfast and the surroundings are on a par with any 5 Star hotel. Location is acceptable, being on the 3rd ring road, gives easy access to most places in town. You can walk to Sanlitun shopping and bar street (10-15min).Location is hit and miss in Beijing, you are going to end up stuck in traffic wherever you stay.I highly recommend Oakwood Residence, why stay in a 30m2 standard hotel room when you can enjoy the comfort of a 100m2 (+) apartment.Great place to stay and fantastic value for money. Be aware,currently, there is a construction site next door. This is standard for China, wherever you go these days construction sites are difficult to avoid, but it caused us no bother at all. May 10 2021 	Thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Oakwood Residence Beijing	There are two Oakwood properties (as of today) in Bejing, and we decided to go with the Oakwood Residence Beijing based on a friend's recommendation. We were very pleased with the property. We stayed at the 2 bedroom Executive apartment, which was almost 200 square meters (large and roomy) with 2 ensuite bathrooms. This was perfect as my husband and I were traveling with my parents and we needed space. The bathrooms have shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, toothbrush, shaver, hair dryer, etc. But there is no vanity set so you should bring/buy your own cotten swabs. There is a large living room with a flatscreen TV and DVD player, and the kitchen was fully loaded with all the appliances, utensils, pots + pans, what have you. There is also a laundry room with a washer+dryer (in one), which was very convenient since we did have laundry after a couple of days. There is also an iron + board. And very important: free WIFI in your apartment.The property is located on the Eastern 3rd ring of the city, which means it's quite centrally located, next to the modern shopping malls and restaurants + bars. It is also about 25 minutes away from the airport (taxi ride should cost about 75 RMB or 8 euros). However, it is not within walking distance to any landmarks, shops or restaurants. As Beijing is insanely big and sprawling, though you can walk to the subway (about 5 minutes by foot), we chose to take the taxi all the time, and it was not a problem whatsoever to get one from the hotel. Most trips cost about 10 RMB (about 1.20 euros). A trip to the absolute center of Beijing, i.e. Tiannman Square will cost you about 25-30 RMB. Though most taxi drivers seemed clueless where the building was, so if you can't speak Chinese, make sure you get directions written down by the concierge.We absolutely loved the swimming pool and gym at the basement level of the building, and we took full advantage of the spa (Chinese massage) facilities connected to the building. The spa is called &quot;Taipan&quot;, and if you tell them you're guests at the Oakwood, you will receive a 20% discount.Breakfast buffet is so-so, but you can order eggs and grilled salmon a la carte for free. The staff got a bit overwhelmed when a lot of people showed up for breakfast at once, but overall it was fine. We would definitely return to this property! Aug 10 2018 	Comfortable Stay!	I was working in Beijing for two months and stayed in these apartments from the end May to the end of July. I had a one-bedroom apartment and it was spotless. It had a full kitchen, washer/dryer, nice sitting area with a large flat screen tv, and king size bed and another flat screen tv in the bedroom. Plenty of closet space. Maid service cleaned twice a week. The price was very reasonable, compared to a hotel. The apartment complex is in close proximity to some major attractions. It also offered a continental breakfast. There is also an assortment of restaurants and shops within the complex. Aug 4 2018 	Great surroundings with first class service	I live in Beijing, but when my father visited, my husband and I decided to have a holiday too and we all booked into a 2 bedroom apartment at the Oakwood. I've stayed in other serviced apartments in Beijing (like Lee Gardens and East Gate Plaza) but the service, furnishings and décor at the Oakwood was far better than any other serviced apartment that I have stayed in. Usually, as the only Chinese speaker in my group, I have to cope with all the dealings with front desk, etc... but the standard of English at the Oakwood is very good and I could relax for a change! The apartment was wonderful - spacious, spotlessly clean and the kitchen was far far better equipped than my own at home! Usually in serviced apartments it's a drag to get them to provide everything needed, but the Oakwood even had nice wine glasses! Despite having our own apartment only 10 minutes away, we didn't need to go home to get anything - the Oakwood had it all!"
"Excellent stay	I stayed at the hotel 3 nights with a twin deluxe. The employees were helpful and always pleasant. The location is very close to the subway and a WU mart (south of the subway station) (like a mini walmart) for shopping. It’s about a 15-20 minute walk to the birds nest. I walked there and took the subway back. Official Cabs are cheap, so it’s a good choice if you have a lot of bags to the airport instead of the subway (only use official cabs to and from the airport) its easy to tell which ones are official and which ones are not. If someone at the airport asks if you need a taxi say no. Then go to the official taxi stand at the airport. It cost me about 50-60 Yuan for 2 people from the hotel to the airport. The subway is easy and excellent to use and the best way to get around (without alot of luggage). The bakery near the Wu mart is also excellent. I was pretty concerned with getting food poisoning and had no issues with the bakery and WUmart for food. The rooms were very clean with a big stand up shower. Every night the staff brought oranges to your hotel room. It was a great stay and I would go again. Nov 7 2021 	Excellent	Great location close to subway and within walking distance of the Olympic stadium although it is a longish walk. Very clean, modern with little snacks supplied to each room in the evening. Each room came with a pet goldfish. Stayed there a few times and would definately use it again. Its a real bargain. Restaurant next door is pretty good too. Nov 5 2021 	Highly Recomended ! Good Value and good rooms	Traveled to Beijing in Oct 2021. Stayed in Orange hotels for 3 nights. the room is clean but relatively small. But it is not an issue. 1st night i felt that the pillow has some smell, have requested to change it. after that is fine.5 mins walking distance to MRT station. There is one Nine head eagle (???) restaurants beside this hotel, it served delicious food. with hotel card can get 10% discount. I recommend it to those who stay at orange to try it. Oct 29 2021 	Wow..Excellent Price and What a Bargain	We intially had stayed at the Orange Hotel in Hangzhou and was impressed with the price, cleanliness and service at this hotel. The hotel in Hangzhou was new so it is very clean.We tried the same Orange hotel in Beijing near the Water Cube. The price cannot be beat. $29 US for regular room or $33 for a larger Deluxe room. This is a bargain considering the other hotels we were at before. The service people are excellent. We wanted noodles and they walked us to the restaurant nearby. They do not speak English very well so you are on your own with any lengthy or customize requests. I used Google translate and show them the chinese display for customize requests. They will get you taxi, write places in Chinese for the taxi for you to go to.The room is large; Larger then the Comfort Inn in the US. Clean, but not ultra clean; Similar to Comfort Inn. The bed is hard by my standard so be aware of hard matress. They do not provide breakfast, but drop off pastries and milk cartons at night for breakfast. There is wired and wireless Internet in each room. There is not a supermarket nearby, but they sell waters, juice, etc at the front desk. We walk half to 3/4 of a mile to Wu-Mart (similar to Walmart) for juice, fresh milk, yogurt, chips, water, cookies, crackers, etc. Wu-mart has a second floor that sells electronics and pretty much anything you need for a house hold. Our kids like Pizza so a Pizza Hut is a 20 minutes walk or 10 RMB with a Taxi. To go to Pearl market on taxi, the cost 40 RMB. To go to Silk market, the price is 40 RMB. There is some traffic during lunch and also between 6-7 pm pending the direction that you are going to with the taxi. Sep 24 2018 	Paralympics - Orange Hotel	We stayed in the hotel during Paralympics and it was excellent for that since it is very close to the stadiums (cca 2,5km).It is also very close to the metro and bus station (cca 500 meters), but taxi is very cheap and if you have address in Chinese it is very good option. From the hotel to downtown you will need approximately 30min which will cost around 40 RMB.The hotel is new and very clean, but the receptionists did not speak English so we had problems communicating with them.Hotel does not offer breakfast, but every night we were getting some bakery products, milk, and tea (free of charge).If you want to drink some good coffee you can find it in hotel Tibet (100m).We paid 30 Euro for 2 people in deluxe room and I believe it is excellent value.If I was going to Beijing again I would stay in this hotel since the ratio of price and service are very good."
"Oct 28 2021 	Great hotel in great position	Stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel, large business type but very good. Rooms spacious , clean and comfortable. Hotel has a geat indoor pool and fitness centre. Breakfast very good.The really good thing is the easy and fun walk in the evening. Walk towards the Bell tower, right on the main road infront of the hotel and then left at the traffic lights. On a gentle stroll down this road will pass all sorts of eating places and life. At the end of that street on the right are 2 excellent restaurants, a Vietnamese and a Chinese. Go round the corner and you come to an allyway on your right which takes you into the Hutong area by the lake which is brillaint for night life, bars and restaurants. Strongly recommend hotel and area Oct 6 2021 	Comfortable rooms great view of city	Comfortable rooms and beautiful hotel. However, not up to 5 star service. The reception staff were completely unaware of restaurant services and opening hours, including the evening duty manager. Room service brought us one set of cutlery for 2 meals and by the time the second set arrived the food was cold. All staff do not have a good grasp of english. We could not book dinner in any of the restaurants and had to eat out on 2 nights. The reception stafff are unhelpful with simple requests. Breakfast was fine but not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. Still nice to stay here though. Aug 30 2021	Oriental Bay Hotel Beijing China	We travelled with one other couple from Shanghai to Beijing on July 25th and stayed at the Oriental Bay International Hotel for five days. We were impressed with our rooms and the magnificent lobby. Staff were courteous and polite. There is a canal in front of the hotel and the metro or subway is a short walk along the canal under a busy intersection and back up onto the main street. The rear of the hotel leads out into a street with small stores where you can purchase basic packaged food staples. A few small restaurants are also on this street. There is a local Internet Cafe close to the hotel and can be located by walking to the street at the rear of the hotel, turn left until the end of the street and then turn left again, the internet cafe is the last building on this street. We enjoyed the Western buffet breakfast at the hotel in the morning complete with egg omelette, pancakes, bacon, toast and an assortment of Chinese food. Jul 30 2021 	Comfortable well-appointed. Good food selection.	Rooms and beds were very spacious. Concierge service was useful for booking taxis etc. Not much of a view from our room - we looked out onto a bank's offices but the noise levels were fine.Good choice of both Chinese and Western food for breakfast but did not experience any other meals as we ate elsewhere due to arranged tours. Jul 29 2021	An imitation of an international hotel	It looks good as you approach it, even though the area is quite drab. The lobby, too, has cosmopolitan aspirations. Unfortunately, the architect's vision does not trickle down to staff level. There are plenty of them, but they don't all seem to know why they are there. The concept of service seems a bit alien to them. Basic items - napkin, spoon, salt - are often missing from the breakfast tables. Waiters go around topping up people's coffee cups but you have to find your own coffee to start with. The luxurious, French-style restaurant on the top floor should be avoided unless you want to play a practical joke on someone. The food looks like haute cuisine but tastes like nothing on earth. They also serve a red liquid called house wine which has the aroma of grease on hot metal.The rooms are OK and there is a special,small-bore pipe in the bathroom for drinking water. The laundry service is good. Nov 24 2018	Excellent 5-Star	I was traveling with a group of 66. This hotel was awesome. Very clean, staff extremely personable and very willing to assist. Most spoke English. Restaurant at hotel is open 24 hours and the food is good at 2 in the morning. The breakfast buffet is A+. A variety of foods-both Asian and Western. The rooms are very large, comfortable and roomy. Nov 22 2018 	Looks nice from the outside and lobby rooms are so so	hotel looks great from the outside.Location is reasonable.The first room I got had a leakage in the ceiling with water drops over the sink (brushed my teeth when drops of water fall straight on my head)Toilets were smelly.Had to change rooms.AC didn't work - so had to sleep with an open window until it was too noisy.concierge service was great.Breakfast was horrible - not fresh (especially the bread and pastries)Although the price was low, I will not come back - there are so many other options near by. May 19 2018	Modern friendly would stay again.	I just came back from about a week's stay at the hotel. Breakfast was included daily, and included choices from all over the world, American style bacon, eggs, pastries (not fresh daily.) Also they had Asian types of food such as soups, rice, vegetables. It sits right on the city moat at the 2nd ring road. Close to Temple of Heaven and Ya Show for shopping. Behind the hotel is a small 7-11 &amp; Korean restaurant accross the street from there. Rooms at the hotel were very roomy, spacious, modern. GLass shower, deep tub, marble. Large closet, safe. Free bottled water, but no refrigerator - or ours wasn't working anyway. 3 chairs, a desk, lots of storage space for all your things. Friendly staff, concierge. ront desk could use more help. Not a lot of staff speak english, but they were always willing to get you someone that could assist. Business center had internet for small fee. I would recommend for Olympics. Taxi cabs were readily available and cheap. Also close enough for Olympics - Bird's Nest &amp; Water Cube less than 10-15 mins away. Jan 27 2018	Great hotel close to Olympic Stadiums	This hotel was wonderful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. They give free internet access, which is a plus. The rooms had very nice decor, warm and inviting. I would definitely stay here again. Jan 10 2018 	smart hotel shame about the smelly toilets	An excellent 5 star Hotel clean ,good staff ,english understood and the food excellent.Only complaint was that at certain times of the day the bathroom smelt of sewage.this is common in the new buildings in china and you have to run the taps and flush toilet to get rid of it .The staff in the end moved us to another room which was no problem.The air conditioning would only blow hot air which meant the windows were left open at night (another problem in china)Pool and gym very good but no private changing facilityssmall problems but all solved Jan 2 2018	A very nice Hotel	This was the second hotel we stayed at on our China tour. The hotel is located on the 3rd ring road of beijing i believe. its right next to a metro station so its easy to hop into Beijing central.The hotel itself was very clean, as was the room and the bathroom. we had no issues through our stay.Nice breakfast but not as nice as our first hotel JC mandarin in shanghai, but you made most of the choices of food, western foods, oriental foods, healthy options. The tea was wrong, it was wrong all over china, just couldnt get a decent cup anywhere.we stayed three nights at this hotel and it was a pleasant stay.the bar in the lobby is quite nice, as is the 24 hour restaurant, which serves western and local food.The swimming pool was under repair for the period of our stay which was dissapointing as it was sparkling swimming pool.view from the hotel wasnt all that as we were facing the ring road, but we didnt go there to peep through hotel window!summary: nice and clean hotel, rooms feel fresh and new. superb location 10 mins to central Beijing on the metro which is on your door step. Nov 30 2017	Great 4-5 star hotel	The Oriental Bay Intl. Hotel was a very nice large hotel. A great place to start our trip in China. The decor was nice. The rooms were nicely sized. The hotel's ammenities were excellent. Be sure to check out the workout room &amp; pool....even if just to take a look.Breakfast buffet was also superb. Plenty to choose from in both Western &amp; Asian food.Everything seemed brand new except the hall/room carpets were a little worn or stained in places, but other than that, everything was top notch! Aug 27 2017 	A great place to stay	Oriental Bay is a lovely hotel-the rooms are very spacious and front desk staff very helpful. There is a wonderful buffet breakfast both Chinese and Western tastes are catered for. &quot;Le ceil &quot;restaurant on the 20th floor was worth a visit and as you can guess had amazing views and can provide buffet and a la carte selections.Leisure facilities were very good-the pool was a little on chilly side and the sauna was self service needed tobe switched on(perhaps this was an energy saving drive). My daughter and I would recommend the in house massage service for those feeling the effects of jet lag.There is a small kiosk selling postcards,stamps confectionery alongside a tailors and tourist shop.Plenty of lifts to all floorsThis was the first experience of Beijing hotels at the start of our tour with Oriental travel.Deserving of 5 star status Aug 20 2017	Fantastic start to our holiday	We arrived very early in the morning after two flights from London and seeing the Orientalbay Hotel was a very welcome sight.We required two rooms for our family of five. The rooms were nicely set out and in our room we had a double bed plus a single bed but the room still wasn't crowded.The staff were all very helpful and couldn't do enough for you.The resturants in the hotel were all lovely and the food was of a very high standard.The children enjoyed the swimming pool in the hotel, though I found it a little cold. We had a evening coat made at the hotel tailors which was excellent value for money and made to a very high standard.We had a fantastic view over the city. Our tour operator was Oriental Travel and they had planned an excellent holiday. Sep 24 2006 	the people	OrientalBay International HotelBeijing, China, AsiaDate : Februari 2006 for two weeks.I have to say it looks good on the outside and nice and clean on the inside. The level off service is good no problem. Dont drink the water from the tab is spiced whit chlorine. They give you 2 bottels off table water every day for free and some noodels of cource. The people in the breakfastroom are very nice after one or two times the know you and give you a nice place to sit. There is for everybody to like chinese or western even for the moslims (halal) food is there. The AC (Airco) is better to turned off to keep it cool in youre roomget one on the southside 1719 or soon it the coolessed place there.They have a sauna health center and swimmingpool. restaurants are ther too and a converence center internet acces.Youre close to the city centre and Lama temple (you have to go there) Soon ill will go back and probaly stay there agian.the trouble off the AC system is on every hotel there so this does not mather anyway.

"Jul 16 2021 	Great find!	I stayed at the Oriental Culture Hotel in Beijing for a week in July 09. I had expected an average 3.5 star hotel in a crappy location. BUT what I found was a great 4 star business hotel in great part of town and close to transport and downtown.Service was good (considering that China is not yet Thailand when it comes to service) and I was upgraded to a Deluxe Room facing the street. The room exceeded expectation. Modern furnishings, huge King size bed with luxury linen. Plasma TV, fast internet (free), CNN, HBO and even a turn down service. The bathroom had a walk in shower with waterfall shower head plus normal power adjustable head. Fresh towels and toiletries daily. Bathrobes and even a turn down service where they gave me a choc and the next day's weather.The staff were helpful and most spoke decent Engish. They were helpful re cabs but abit clueless re tours. The lobby is big and well lit.Only gripe was that my fridge didn't work. That said, I didn't complain so I didn't give them a chance to fix it.This hotel is a great find and I'll definately stay there again!! May 21 2021 	The best hotel I have ever seen!	I was positively surprised when I opened the door of our room. modern furniture, huge flat screen TV, very spacious, air conditioning, complimentary Internet connection (wired) lovely stone floored shower, super modern bath room and generally very very clean. The breakfast is good, very Chinese though. staff do not speak English fluently but are very nice and will do everything they can.The location is also great very close to Lama Temple. For the rest of sightseeing places I cannot say much since we were transferred with our guide.Don't forget your cap or they don't let you in the swimming pool. May 3 2021 	Dont if its warm weather!	All was what I would have expected given the low price except the TV reception was vey poor but most importantly there was no a/c. Having asked the staff numerous times I was told every time they would have someone check the a/c. Being my inquisitive self I discovered the had it entirely turned off to save money. I woke wih little sleep this morning to a sweaty hot and 31 degree room and right now (9pm) its 26. Staff have advised to &quot;open a window&quot;...in noisy polluted Beijing right! Besides..its made no difference. We are moving out tomorrow. Apr 29 2021	Good Comfortable Hotel In Beijing	We stayed at this hotel last week. We were with a tour group. We had a problem with our room but this was quickly sorted out by our tour guide. The room was very clean and comfortable.If you change money in the hotel, you need your passport even for cash. If you use an ATM make sure it is at a Bank of China as some of our tour had problems at other banks.If you go out of the hotel and turn right and walk about 100 yards you will find a big supermarket selling everything you could want. It is worth a visit just to see what is on sale on the meat and fish counters.There are plenty of restaurants around, although several in our party at at the hotel and found the buffet excellent and very reasonably priced. The breakfast buffet was very good with plenty of variety.TravellingPensioners Apr 14 2021 	Poor Air Condioning in April	We stayed in this hotel for four nights in April 2021. Weather in this month in Beijing changes from mild to hot. The hotel administration did not turn on the centralized air conditioning though it was much needed for comfortable sleep in the night. Later on I heard it is typical of many other local hotels in China. On this account the visitors are cautioned to check whether they provide air conditioning. Apart from this there was construction taking place in the next building it also caused noise at night. Other than this hotel was neat and clean and relatively newer interior. The price was also reasonable. Feb 16 2021	Enjoyed our stay	My husband, son and I stayed in Beijing Oriental Culture hotel for 5 nights in July 2018, and enjoyed our experience. We booked a suite and requested an extra bed in the living room for my son, all with very reasonable price. The suite was spacious and well furnished and decorated. The location was ideal for us, as the hotel is in a fairly quiet area of the city, but still centrally located and only 5 minutes walk away from a subway station. There are many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel, and there is a supermarket only a few minutes away, very convenient! The internet service was good; we also booked a domestic flight through the business service of the hotel to our satisfaction. We will definitely book this hotel again. Jan 14 2021 	Clumsy staff and poor maintenance	On the surface a beautiful and nicely located hotel, but unfortunately we ran into a few problems there. The toilet in the room we were given was clogged. The staff called a plummer who quickly arrived on the scene with a plunger. He did not fix the problem, but apparently told the staff that he had. We had to complain a second and a third time before we finally got to speak with the assistant manager. She said we could switch to another room on the afternoon of the next day. 8 am the next morning she called to reconfirm our agreement, that yes, we would switch rooms that afternoon. An hour later she called again and asked us to switch rooms immediately. She generously gave us 5 minutes to pack and get ready to move. The rest of the stay went by without trouble, but there still was a few things we were not happy about:1.The new room had a non smoking designation, but smelled of cigarettes. 2. Old condom wrappers lay behind the bed side tables of both rooms.3. One of the two main elevators smelled like a public restroom. Standing close to the entrance you could even smell it as it came down the shaft towards you. 4. The staff's English skills are limited to simple hotel related matters. They behave more like robots with preprogrammed responses than actual human beings, but this is normal in China. The Chinese try hard and they build beautiful things, but they fall short on maintenance, cleanliness and what I like to call common sense. Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel is a good example of this, but it is also a part of what makes China such a fascinating destination. Jan 6 2021	Loved the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel	We visited Beijing, China from December 30, 2018 to January 4, 2021. We really had a great time in Beijing especially so that we picked the right hotel. Before booking our hotel with the travel agent, we made sure that the hotel we are about to stay is clean and comfortable. We tried looking up the hotels in the internet and found out that there were a lot of horror stories of the lower ranked hotels. We found the reviews in this site very helpful. So we decided to book our 6day/5night stay at the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel.We were very impressed when we got to the hotel during our first night. After a very cold first day tour of Beijing, we found the hotel to be nice, clean and comfortable. The front desk staff were very helpful and accommodating. Our rooms were ready and immaculately cleaned! The breakfast buffet was also good. It had a choice of eastern and western food. The staff at the Oriental Cafe were pleasant and very courteous. We really had a great time during breakfast as the cafe manager made us feel at home and well taken cared of.The location is also good. It had small food shops and stores nearby. There's a supermarket and a Mc Donald's outlet just two minutes away. A subway station is also nearby. We were able to take the subway to various parts of Beijing. The hotel is really accessible!We were very happy about the service and the rates. We thought that we could not have this kind of accommodation since we were not booked in a 5 star hotel. The Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel is indeed a hidden treasure. We did not want any terrible hotel stories to be part of our Beijing tour. We found none.We hope that the service of the hotel would even get better. Prehaps they should have a non-smoking floor. Oct 24 2018 	Reasonable	Booked as part of a China Tour:www.tourchina.co.ukHotel seemed fine and comfortable although beds were very hard.It seems all the 4/5 star hotels on our trip were very similar in all that the hotel and rooms offered but were pretty much business type hotels you could find in any city in the world.Most hotels and this included will only provide 2 small bottles of drinking water and will charge you for extra - my advice is to go out of hotel and turn right and there are 2 big supermarkets to buy water a lot cheaper.One tip is that in all the hotels we stayed in the alcohol was very expensive in the bars......300mls beer 30-40 yuen ( £3-4) - outside in restaurants or supermarket - 10 yuen and 30 yuen respectively. Well in this hotel we found a cheaper way - the restaurant on the ground floor next to the lifts sells 600mls local beer for 15 yuen - the staff seem more than happy for you not to eat and just have a drink - but you can't take out the beer into the general hotel area.Otherwise hotel is in a good area with good local restaurants - advice is to choose bigger establishments which are full of local people - they won't speak english so be prepared to point to what you want on other people's tables - don't feel embarrasses as they will be watching you too! Apr 28 2018 	A hidden gem -- grab it!	My friend and I found this place pretty much by accident when looking for a replacement for the City Hotel Beijing (about which, the less said the better).And what a happy accident it was! This is basically a five star hotel at a three to four star price. The rooms are gorgeously furnished, with couches, desks, televisions in both the lounge room and bedroom, and pristeen bathrooms. Our rooms were done in different styles (one more modern, one more classic in feel), but both were absolutely top class, and were superior even to the more expensive rooms we had in the five star Beijing Asia Hotel.24 hour room service is available at reasonable prices, and the quality of food is fairly good (try the chocolate cake!). The morning breakfast buffet offers a wide range of Chinese and Europoean/American options, with staff on hand to cook eggs and omelettes to your liking.The gym and pool facilities exceed those of many five star hotels in Beijing (although the dumbells at the gym only go up to 25 kg, which may not be enough for some). The service is courteous and helpful, and comparable to any similar hotel in Beijing (though of course not as polite as you would find in, say, Japan).The location is good as there is a well known restaurant street nearby, although as with just about anywhere in Beijing (where the city blocks are enormous), you will need a taxi or the subway to go pretty much anywhere. However, transport prices are so cheap that this isn't a problem.My only quibbles were that one of our rooms took far too long (around 1.5 hours) to prepare after we checked in, and the rooms do not include ironing boards and irons, which you have to borrow from reception instead. Overall though, the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel was a fantastic experience and I will be heading straight back there when I next visit Beijing. I should add -- what unfortunately does not go without saying in mainland China -- that we experienced absolutely no shenanigans from the hotel staff or management. This place seems to represent the better side of Chinese culture. Mar 30 2018 	Had a great stay at the Beijing Oriental Culture Hotel	Had a fantastic time at this hotel. Had only good service at check in (could have been better), I think foreigners actually get better service than patrons of asian appearence.The room was very comfortable, room was made up each day and covers turned down each evening with a chocolate placed on the pillow in an envelope with the next days forcast temperature.What makes this hotel good, it the location. Close to the Lama Temple and Confucius Temple and new subway station is only a few blocks away.Local to a wonderful street full of fantastic restaurants made it easy to find food at any time of night! The lights were so so pretty and great for photo ops. Mar 27 2018	They need to learn what the word ""service"" means	I have just checked in to this hotel and had a horrible experience at check-in. The people said they gave our room away because we were one hour late in arriving to the hotel (due to a flight delay). Moreover, they were extremely rude and not accomodating. Instead of upgrading us to a better room, they have put us in a cheaper room with no window. They screamed at us and would answer the questions of the Chinese before dealing with our issues. The staff is rude and racist. A terrible first impression and if I were you, I would pay the additional few dollars to stay in a better hotel. Jul 24 2006 	Loved it	Hi, i stayed at the Oriental Culture Hotel when i went on a school trip with my school band in 2004 representing the uk in the international music festival. China was an amazing place. The hotel was the best place i have ever and probably ever will stay in. Staff are friendly and polite, you are given a swipe card too get into ur room be careful not to lose but if u do u canacquire another one at reception. In the lobby you have a seating area which is surrounded by a fountain a piano and some palm trees. The food is chinese food and nice if u like that sort of thing. I only ate the rice luckily there was a Mcdonalds nxt door to the hotel. The swimming pool is big and has a lifeguard on duty. The hotel also boasts a gym, a huge bowling alley, snooker rooms, football tables etc. The facilities at this hotel are absolutely fantastic. When i first got up to my room i couldnt believe it's size. The view out of the window went on to the high street, we had a widesreen television which gives you movies ni english or with english subtitles. Our room consisted of two double beds for two people with an ensuite bathroom which had a shower, bath, wash basin and toilet. There is plenty of storage space but beaware of not being able to drink the drinking water. The staff were pleasent and the cleanliness of the hotel was amazing. i left some money for our cleaner as she did an amazing job. Next door to the hotle is a cd shop sellnig the latest english albums for 12p. Convert your money to yen and beaware that everything is very cheap. Mcdonalds give u huge portions for less than british price. i had a two litre coke for 99p. Visit the great wall of china, tien a men square etc. The oriental culture hotel was amzing and a brilliant stay"
"Jun 7 2021 	Great value and excellent service	Despite all the renovation going on - dusty entrance way, gym and pool out of action, really enjoyed my 5 day stay here. Free internet, spacious and very comfortable rooms. Service with a smile everywhere you go, although sometimes a bit difficult to make yourself understood away from the front desk. Food is OK, but i tended to walk across the road to the cheap and tasty local restaurants where you can eat for less than £3! Oct 21 2018 	Fine Stay at the Oriental Garden	I stayed at the Oriental Garden over a weekend for business, but found it also to be convenient for a day of sight-seeing. What the hotel lacks in character is more than made up for with sizable and clean rooms ... and what I lack in good Chinese language skills was made up for with a friendly, English-speaking front desk staff!The hotel offers 24-hour room service with a selection of both Asian and Western dishes. Though I did not order from room service, I did eat one breakfast at the hotel and found the buffet to be quite good. Selections included everything from steamed buns to omelets and french toast.The hotel was conveniently located no more than a 10 minute taxi ride from Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City. Taxis were readily available and the doorman will help call one for you.I cannot fault the hotel for anything and my stay was a pleasant one. Though it lacks character and is not within easy walking distance to the historical sights, the hotel represents a good value and I would not hesitate to stay there again on my next trip to Beijing. Nov 19 2017	Value for Money	My wife and I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour of China and found it to be quite comfortable with pleasant staff and good surroundings.The hotel boasts a garden complex next door (hence its name) which is free to hotel guests on presentation of your room key. The locals have to pay to get in which many do as it appears to be a central point for early morning exercises such as Tai Chi, Badminton and a variety of other games enjoyed by the Chinese.The rooms have either twin double beds or one king size bed, television, airconditioning, safe, tea and coffee facilities, lounge and combined bath shower. For those that can afford it they even have suites available which are quite large.Breakfast is a combination of western and local foods, plenty of it and it is quite sufficient for most people. The hotel has a small but comprehensive shopping arcade that has for sale a myriad of local items at relatively cheap prices as well as a tailor that promises to make a suit within 24 hours at a moderate price.It has a unique &quot;Old World&quot; ambience about it with everything in dark wood that is characteristic of the Chinese. The staff were friendly enough and could speak fairly good English which made for easy conversation when checking in and out.All in all not a bad hotel. Aug 18 2017 	Has some potential but much better places close by	On the surface, the Oriental Garden's rooms seem to be adequate, if a little worn. However, after arriving my business associate and I left the hotel as soon as we could make other arrangements due to a range of problems. First, the beds are almost literally as hard as rocks. Second, as of August 2017 some areas of the hotel are under renovation. A note left in the room indicated that work would be done between 8am and 8pm. However, on some nights work-related noise continued past 10pm. Also, the air conditioning was not adequate. It took several hours at the maximum setting for the air conditioning to make the room comfortable for sleeping in Beijing's August heat. Finally, as others report, the staff's English is less than perfect, though this did not present a major problem.If you are willing to spend a little more, you should definitely look into staying at the excellent Kuntai Royal Hotel located two subway stops south. Apr 11 2017 	Has great potential but hasn't reached it yet	The rooms and bathrooms are modern, well-equipped, and elegant. It's true, the staff speaks limited English, but wasn't really a problem for me. Also, the breakfast buffet was crappy and too expensive. The doorman was very polite, as were all the employees. The gym was small. Location is very good, lots to do nearby.I had one major problem: they refused to turn the air conditioning on! The weather outside was mild, but my room was too warm, and the only advice they had was to open the window. The hotel is on a major street and the room was very loud with the window open. Make sure you ask for a room on the back side of the building. This place could be a really nice hotel if they take some classes on how to handle non-chinese guests. Oct 18 2016 	friendly but a bit short sighted	we stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found similar problems to the first review. lack of English speaking staff may have been more of a problem for others, but we got by with our mandarin phrase book. we stayed in the exectutive floor which has the bonus of free internet access (broadband - byo laptop) and free snacks in the exec lounge and coffee. our room wasn't ready on our arrival, and we were offered free coffee.the staff are quite young, but we found that everywhere. the front desk and concierge were excellent, but the cleaning staff are not very good. our bathtub had some ugly brown stains on the bottom, and when asked, the cleaning girl said she doesn't clean that. the japanese restaurant has a great lunch offer of teppanyaki for 48Yuan, which was great for a lunch meal.if you're looking for an english orientated hotel, this is not the one, but it was basically clean and good, and i would stay there again for this price range. in china, it can get much worse.don't ask for an early morning wake up call though, ours came about 15 minutes late - we had already woken ourselves up!!! Oct 15 2016 	Has Potential But Disappointing	I stayed here on business for 3 nights, and while the hotel itself has attractive decor and much potential for being business friendly, I was quite disappointed. The biggest problem is an utter lack of effort to cater to Western tourists. The staff language skills are terrible, the food, while overpriced as expected for being in a hotel, caters almost exclusively to the Chinese community, and the only TV stations in English were CNN and HBO. (Disclaimer: My only available comparison is the excellent Holiday Inn Shenyang, located in a MUCH less touristy region, whose staff spoke excellent English and made the effort to offer almost a dozen English-speaking TV stations and a wide variety of international dining options.) The cleaning staff was rude and pushy, bothering me even with the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on my door at 10:30am, saying if they did not clean the room immediately, they would not clean it all day. I was forced to print out a business agreement in the Business Center, which appears well equipped for business needs, but the 40-page agreement at RMB 10 per page cost me an outrageous US $50 for one copy. To its credit, they do have a dedicated non-smoking floor with fairly large rooms and very clean, modern bathrooms, but should I ever come to Beijing again, I will certainly seek out a different place to stay. Jan 25 2016	Very nice hotel	Very nice hotel in very good location. Its a 3 minute walk from the dongzhimen subway station (on the blue line) and a 10 RMB cab ride to sanlitun lu (bar street). The rooms are very clean and spacious. The staff is very helpful. Be aware though that most staff doesn't speak much english (beyond the basics)."
"Aug 10 2021 	Good hotel - a bit far from the city center	We stayed in this hotel for three nights and enjoyed our stay. We were in a large room with a free internet connection available directly on the TV. The hotel staff was very friendly although their english was a bit poor.The hotel is located about 15 minutes drive from the city center. Except that it is not really conveniant, it's not a big deal since taxi fares are really low and it is usually easy to find one.We would definitly return it that hotel. Jun 27 2021 	Very nice hotel	Hotel was very good although it boasts four stars it's more like three stars. The hotel is owened and run the police dept. !!!! Yes thats right, the cops own and run the hotel. Can't complain really about it. Only thing was after a week of staying there I had to ask them to changethe bed sheets and vacuum the floor. But i mean i had a large flat screen with free internet in my kingsize bedroom. Staff had limited english but were usually willing to help where possible. Infact the manager (female) asked me out one day - lets just say not only the weather was hot.... Aug 5 2017 	Great Value!	I am writing this review at the Peixin - the computer in the room is an excellent bonus! I have just read the previous reviews and would like to comment that this is my 7th hotel in China and the beds are the same firm matress everywhere, so that is a non-issue. There only IS one English language TV channel - CCTV channel 9 - in China, so you can't blame the hotel for that! Yes, the hotel is a taxi ride from Tian'amin Square but the ride is 12 Yuan - les than $2 - and takes 10 minutes, which makes this hotel great value. The rooms are clean, my single has a king bed, and the room is quite spacious. The breakfast buffet is very good and great value for 20 yuan - served from 6:30 to 9:00. I had a problem with this computer and housekeeping was at my door within 5 minutes to solve the problem. The hotel is non-smoking which is a pleasant change from most hotels in China, and is listed as a &quot;Green Hotel&quot;. I booked on-line and the price was a lot cheaper than the posted rack-rate at the hotel. I would definitely recommend the Peixin - great value for the money. Mar 31 2017	very nice hotel	The hotel is very near Hongquiao market and some malls. The staff are quite friendly and helpful, though some may have difficulty in speaking English. You can exchange your dollars to yuan at the front desk. Before going out, ask the front desk clerk to write in chinese characters the place where you would like to go to. The room is big enough for two people. There are no good views though, one side faces a school area and some residential areas. Overall, i think the place is wonderful and i will definitely will stay there again when i go back to Beijing. Aug 4 2016	Great	Hotel is nice. Rooms very clean. Front desk staff have limtied knowledge of English BUT they do their best. There is a small gift shop that sells trinkets and personal items should you need them. The hotel is convenient to Pearl Shoping Market. It is about a 10 minute walk. Streets perfectly safe to walk around. There are a few small stores around, a McDonalds just down the street. The morning breakfast buffet at hotel is good. The coffee needs work though. (so does most of China)There is an atm machine in hotel. They also have a currency exchange at front desk. They take most currency at reasonable rates. Beds are firm as in most chinese hotels. There are computers in rooms with free internet access. It can get frustrating using them as they have a Chinese keyboard and you need to type all IN CAPS in order for the English not to convert over to chinese. Still, sending a quick email home without costing anything was great. Limited english speaking television. Oct 20 2014	Okay Hotel	Pro's: InexpensiveCon's; Poor location, far from most areas of interest -10-15 minute taxi ride to most major city center sites. Uncomfortably hard beds -like most Chinese state run hotels."
"Sep 17 2021 	A good comfortable hotel in a city that is changing before your eyes.	I stayed at this hotel for a few nights and found it very pleasant, the room was very comfortable and spotless, I even had my own chinese dressing gown and the view was interesting with the ten lanes of traffic and young lads stopping buses with red flags.The breakfast was a mixture of eastern and western and was nice, the loby area contains a bar which was relaxing to sit in at the end of the day and is not expensive for a four star hotel. The staff were pleasant and the whole hotel was spotless really.Regarding the location, the hotel is situated on one of the ring roads that circle Beijing, which is such a massive City, if you are on a tour this will not affect you, the nearest underground is a very long walk away but taxis are cheap and can take you to all the sites like the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Tianamen Square etc.If you leave the hotel on foot and walk past the KFC parallel to the road for about fifteen minutes you will come to an area the contains a pocket of Beijings fast disappearing hutongs (which are like little houses in very narrow lanes) where not so long ago the whole of the city was populated with these dwellings, only here there is no guided tours for westerners. I also came across an interesting market in the same area which was pretty big and there were all kinds of things on sale, again with the area around the hotel being so far out, this was purely for the locals and I got some currious looks here but not unpleasant. With the pace of change in Beijing I doubt that this kind of place will exist in this city for much longer.I forgot to add that opposite the hotel on the other side of the ring road there is a nice restaurant, I can't remember the name but it is up a flight of stairs, you will have to walk to the crossing to get to it. Jun 12 2021 	great hotel for the price	have stayed at plaza many times over past 5 years, always go back as it is great value for money, very clean, modern, great massages, food so so but when in beijing you should be eating at restaurants. Feb 18 2021	Liked it very much	Stayed for three nights as part of a tour. Had two room keys so it was handy if two of you needed to come back at different times or to leave one in the room so that the air con stayed on. Rooms were very warm even with air con (think some one moved rooms because of this). A thick duvet on the bed, as with most of the Chinese hotels we stayed at. Room not particularly big but clean. Kettle and tea/coffee sachets provided. Lighting quite dark, various spotlights, no main ceiling light. Slippers even replaced. Fun to watch the ten lanes of traffic or so if you’re on that side. Had a massage card put under the door!Didn’t see many shops of interest, but there was a handy petrol station - turn right up the same side of the road - selling a few basics. The off-licence the other way seemed to want to rip tourists off - told us bottled water was about 4 times the usual going rate. Go to the petrol station instead, fixed prices and they sell beer! KFC right outside the hotel.Breakfast room was very busy, food was nice - excellent banana bread/cake.Can send postcards via the concierge by the front desk, although always dubious when you hand over the money and they say they’ll put the stamps on, most arrived but one didn’t.Had a few goes at trying to change travellers’ cheques at reception as the person who dealt with the exchange was away from the desk on other business, but managed to do so in the end - but thought a £2 sterling charge on a £50 cheque a bit steep. May 21 2018	Much better than Hotels in UK	As a frequent traveller I was very pleasantly surprised by just how good the hotel is. The room was quiet, pleasant, well equipped and clean and the staff most friendly and helpful. In the UK I have spent many years having to stay in upper range hotels for work and finding a quiet room where one stood a chance of a good night's sleep was, in cities, very difficult. The 6.30 a.m. start for breakfast was spot on (unlike many UK hotels where they are never ready on time). I was the only foreigner who dined in the Chinese restaurant and the food and the service was just superb. Although not in the very centre of town it is only a short and very cheap taxi ride (considerably less than a bus fare for a comparable journey in the UK) took me to where I wanted to go. I would be pleased to stay there again. May 12 2018 	Nice !!	The hotel is very high standard - staff are very friendly and have good english. Hotel is spotless and all amenties are excellent. rooms have all facilities and are really good. Nov 2 2017 	Great Value	I have stayed in this hotel a few times. Pro: The rooms are very nice and modern. Staff is friendly. It's is quiet. The breakfast buffet is great. At below RMB 600 is. a steal.Con: The location is a bit inconvenient and it's a long long walk to the subway station.I will stay there again on my next rip! Oct 18 2017	Lovely hotel but chaotic breakfasts	Lovely hotel, great room, pleasant staff, free bottled water in room every day, but breakfast times were chaotic to say the least. Staff unable to cope at breakfast time on both days we stayed, They ran out of cutlery, plates, glasses, food on both mornings, staff were running around like headless chickens, lack of any managment seem to be the problem. Aug 14 2017	Not an ideal location	The hotel itself is great, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable, with a fridge and good size bathroom (with bath). Previous reviews have mentioned hard beds, our beds were fine, but our bed at home is hard anyway. We had an additional bed for our 14 year old son, this was fine, better that a lot of 'put ups'. They also give you a bottle of water for each person each day. Breakfast was plentiful and good, both Chinese and Western. Although the tea was luke warm, coffee was fine. The only complaint is the location of the hotel, there is nowhere to actually walk to. There are a few shops, mainly mobile phone shops and curio antiques. Also like all the other hotels it is on the side of the main roads. The dinner in the hotel was one of the worse we had throughout the holiday, we ate there twice. There is a cafe on site where you can buy cakes, which we did and they were quite nice. But salavation is at hand, there is KFC next door, and although they don't speak much English, they do have a menu you can point at! The only reason I would not stay there again is due to the location, nothing wrong with the hotel itself. Jul 16 2017 	Wonders of China	Very modern hotel, plenty of facilities, very good food!!!Hotel has got cards printed for taxi drivers so you can &quot;show&quot; them what you'd like to see in Beijing..There's too much to see!!!!Apart from climbing the Great wall, taking thousands of pictures in Forbidden city, Summer Palace, Tiananmen Square, walking down the Sacred way to Ming Tombrs with stone animals and statues on both sides...it is much recommended to hurry up and see the old Beinjing on rickshaws..before it's all destroyed for the Olympics..if you like your bargains..should go to many excellent markets, so much better than Turkish ones! (it's wrong but they're such a good quality it makes me wonder whether they're not stolen!!! :) Apr 2 2017 	Fair to middling	This is a China rated 4 star hotel located in the Chaoyang District. The room I stayed in showed visible signs of wear but was comfortable and clean. The bed was a typical China hotel bed; hard as a rock and not very comfortable. My stay was one night and I was not able to walk around outside but a map indicated that Curio City is not too far away though probably outside of walking distance.The hotel is on a busy street and street sounds could be heard 15 floors up. The breakfast buffet was average with a fair selection of food. When I ate at 7:30 AM, the seating was full and the option was to wait or share a table with strangers. This might be fine for those wishing to meet others, it can provide a grumpy morning start to others. There were a number of tourists seen at breakfast.The airport is located about 25 km away and it took approximately 60 minutes by taxi at 9 AM during a weekday with traffic. Jan 12 2017	wonders of china	Beijing is absolutely incredible, and our experienced was enhanced at our 3 nights at the Plaza Hotel. Excellent value for money, clean, super service, and a pleasureable manner with all the staff. They went out of their way to assist us with the food. We are &quot; Kosher&quot; &amp; they did everything to ensure that we had our meals without problems. Have only one small complaint, the beds were a little hard, but we were so exhausted from sightseeing that we fell asleep immediately. Very quiet, and a very nice Hotel. Thoroughly recommended. Met a lot of Israeli,s who had the same opinions as ourselves. Thank you Plaza Hotel for such an experience. We shall return.Anthony &amp; Gloria Hyatt Cardiff Wales. United Kingdom Nov 27 2006	The Plaza is a modern slightly better than a Holiday Inn business hotel.	Summary:The Plaza is a modern, slightly better than a Holiday Inn, business hotel. It is an inexpensive taxi ride away from most of Beijing’s major sites.When and why we stayed:Stayed for three nights in November 2006 during a Highlights of China tour.Cost:The hotel was included in the overall cost of our holiday.Room:Our room was clean and well furnished with new modern furniture. The large double bed was comfortable. Facilities included TV; tea &amp; coffee making facilities; Mini Bar; hair dryer; and desk. The bathroom was clean, with shower gel; shampoo; tooth brushes etc provided free-of-charge. Two bottles of complimentary water were left for us each day The Hotel: The Plaza is a modern business hotel. It has several restaurants, including Chinese, a coffee shop and Japanese restaurant. The buffet breakfast in the coffee shop was very good, with east meets west food: fruit; dim sum; cereals; noodles; bacon; rice; and cooked-to-order omelettes. Dinner for two in the coffee shop: soup; main courses; and beer cost 238 yuans.The hotel’s laundry service is excellent – it cost 30 yuans to get a pair of jeans cleaned. They were returned to our room within hours. The staff were friendly, spoke English far better than we speak Mandarin, and were helpful. When we had a problem with our toilet a repair man arrived promptly. Internet access in the business centre costs 2 yuans per minute with a 10 minutes minimum. Location:The hotel is situated on Beijing’s Third ring road. The nearest Metro Station (Guomao) at The World Trade Centre is a 17 yuans taxi ride away. To reach Tiannamen Square by taxi costs 35 – 40 yuans. There are few restaurants or shops in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. There is a KFC next door. Panjiayuan, Beijing’s biggest antique market is within walking distance of the hotel.The city:We were amazed how modern, western, and huge Beijing is. We were amazed to discover the city has 50 Starbucks. Katie Melua can never have visited Beijing. There are far more cars than bicycles on the city’s American-wide roads, which including its six ring roads are mobbed all day with motorised traffic jams. Must-sees within the city are Tiannamen Square; The Summer Palace; and The Forbidden City. The Silk Market on Chang’an Avenue is worth a visit for the lover of inexpensive high-quality faux designer gear. Oct 28 2006 	signs of old Beijing	I stayed at this hotel because of a conference i was attending here. The location was excellent, but the hotel is a bit old and dated, without particular charm to compensate. The hard beds were a real problem!Although the food was good, the breakfast arrangements were a bit of a shambles. I wouldn't have classed this as 5 star as it is advertised. May 26 2006	Good Hotel	We stayed here for several nights as part of a tour of China, so as the hotel was included in the tour, I have no idea of the price and whether or not it is value for money.The public areas are not as spacious as some hotels we stayed at in China, and the room was adequate rather than enormous. It was clean and well presented, however.The staff were helpful, and I used the internet in the business centre without diffculty and at a reasonable price.We only had a set &quot;Western&quot; dinner here, organised by the tour company, and this was a mistake as there was no choice and difficulties in getting alternative dishes. Buffet breakfast was very good though.The neighbourhood is a building site at present, and Beijing at this time of year was full of pollution, especially dust blown in from the Gobi desert. Dec 29 2005 	Excellent hotel food availability in hotel somewhat peculiar	I stayed at the Plaza Hotel from 30 Nov 2005 till 5 Dec 2005, while on a business trip to Beijing. The hotel is rated 4*. The hotel is very modern, well kept and certainly very clean. There is free high speed broadband available, both wired and wireless. The wireless beacon signal is somewhat odd. I could get the signal in one position, but if I were to move my laptop by just a centimeters, I would lose signal. Wired connection was great. As for food availability in the hotel, if you want to have room service, there are effectively 2 Oriental dishes available only (wonton noodles and tempura), even though the menu lists much more, As I stayed up till quite late each night to talk to people back in the UK, I often got hungry and became a regular for their late night wonton noodles. The noodles were OK, though I have had better in various parts of SE Asia.The hotel has 2 restaurants, one serving Western food and another serving Chinese food. In the Chinese restaurant, which was open from 1200 till 1400 and 1700 till 2100, some items on the menu were always &quot;sold out&quot; though the items available were excellent.Their laundry service was excellent. The stated &quot;regular service&quot; was return of clothes by 1800, though I got mine much earlier, by about 1300 for clothes that left my room at about 0930.I paid approx GBP 38 per night for the room. Nov 14 2005	Plaza very good	We stayed at this hotel for three days and were very impressed. Very clean, comfortable and modern rooms. The food was uniformly excellent, particularly the breakfasts which were some of the best we've ever had - juices, fruit, toast, bacon, eggs, cereals, tea and coffee, plus cold meats and cheeses or oriental foods.I would recommend this place without hesitation.

"Oct 27 2021 	Fabulous!	Incredible value!!!This is a GREAT hotel in all aspects, if you do not mind being in the city center. The rooms are really as represented on their website, fab bathrooms and amenities, very unexpected considering their rates. Internet is complimentary and not restricted, great pool and spa, variety in dining options and the whole look of the hotel is very chic. Metro stop is 2 blocks away and a few minutes and the ride to Tiananmen Square is about 20 minutes on the same line. Taxis are inexpensive and hotel is on main road to downtown very near &quot;ring road 5&quot;. Staff is very helpful although language is still a bit of a barrier, but they do try their best.This is one of the best value for the money I have ever encountered! Oct 4 2021 	Very comfortable design hotel	We stayed one week in this hotel. We arranged a hotel shuttle service and that was very comfortabel. They picked us up with an Audi A6 and it costed about 30 minutes to reach the hotel. During rush houres you have to count on 45-60 minutes traveling time by car. You can also take the Airport Express line, than by circle line 2 and then take line 1 to Babaoshan subway station (exit D). Turn to the left if you leave the metro station. From there it's about 7 minutes walking. Metro prices are low: 2 yuan for one trip and the bus is even cheaper: 1 yuan, just put the money in the box when entering the bus and take your ticket. Checking in was smooth and the staff is warm and friendly. They always greet you when entering or leaving the hotel. We had a club room. They are situated on floors 21 and 22. You can use the executive lounge for complementary breakfast, soft drinks during the whole day and from 5.30 - 7.30 PM they have happy houre with snacks. They also provide internet on 2 computers and a printer.The hotel is brand new and it's lovely designed. The rooms are good, spacious and one of the features of the rooms are the (Pullman) beds. They are very comfortable and they provide about 6 pillows per person, so u can use the pillow you like. Airco is fine, no noise. The lightning of the room is also very good (direct / indirect light, night lights, etc). Everything is very clean and comfortable. We used the pool, the gym and the small sauna and steamroom. Use is for free. But if you want to use the spa and / or the &quot;big&quot; sauna, you have to pay extra. I don't know the costs, but I think it will be reasonable priced. Rooms were also cheap in my opinion (about 600 - 700 yuan per night for the club room). The hotel is south westly situated from the city. Taking line 1 of the subway brings you in about 20 - 25 minutes in the city centre. For us this was no problem. Next to the hotel you can find Wanda Plaza, a shopping mall with also some (fast) restaurants. The only complaint I have is that service was not always 100% professional. During the first 2 days, they offered us turning down service, but then they stopped it. That was also with the newspaper. Sometimes they brought a newspaper, sometimes not. But in my opinion this were minor issues. The staff is, as said, very polite, friendly and warm and they will do everything to please you. If you want to have information about making some trips in and around Beijing, please ask for Alan. He can give you all the information you want and if necessary he can arrange cars, drivers etc. for you. Overall I think this hotel is very good and I can recommend it if it's not a problem to travel by metro or taxi (also very cheap, but use only the official taxis). Aug 26 2021 	nice hotel	it is a nice hotel, all the equipments are brand newalthough far away from hotel, walking distance to metro station, can go everywhere easily by subway.staff is very friendly, but seem lack of experience, sometimes even how to do with certain proceduresshortage...hotel is in cemetery area....a little bit weired, but it's ok la.. Aug 19 2021 	Great value for money!	I had some reservations about this hotel because of the location, but it was very easy to get into town. The staff was very helpful and they were always willing to assist me. Alan, the concierge, was particularly friendly and very professional. The rooms are spacious with great views of the city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune in accommodation but still expects a good service. I will definitely come back here again! Aug 9 2021 	Superb	Superb hotel rooms, attractive decor and mod-cons, very clean, brand-new, excellent service, all customer staff could speak english, and free internet. Also, nice shopping mall next door, and subway a short walk down the road. Only drawback is the location, which is slightly out of town, but a 50 yuan ($10) taxi ride soon solved that problem. I definately would consider staying here again. Jul 23 2021	Beautiful clean comfortable hotel - would stay there again	Our family stayed in this hotel for three nights with a large tour group. The rooms were big with great views and the beds were very comfortable. Everything was clean and brand new! There is a mall and grocery store across the street. The only draw back was that it was far from down town Beijing and thus it took an hour to get to anything... Jul 2 2021 	Grand hotel and rooms	The rooms are just fab -- well appointed and very spacious. The lobby is stunning, the Bar is very cozy and the Buffet in the is also Restaurant very nice. The service is very good and helpful and the staff goes out of there way to make you feel welcome. The free internet is also a nice feature and the bathrooms have a separate shower with a soothing rainforest showerhead.Great indoor pool and spa facilities.I booked an advanced purchase rate with breakfast included and even though its not in the citycenter the taxi ride is only about 45RMB to Tiannamen area (only 4 EUR) so if you don't mind the travel time about 15/20 minutes it is a really good value. There is also the metro stop line 1) just a few minutes walk that takes you straight to city center for 20 cents. Jun 10 2021 	Beautiful new hotel	This hotel is brand new and is a 5 star establishment. The rooms are very well appointed with lovely modern bathrooms. The food at the restaurant is excellent especially the dinner buffet. Although the hotel is a little way from the centre of Beijing, it is only a short walk to the subway, which takes you straight through to the main sites of Beijing. The subway fare is only 2 CNY. It is also near The Fragrant Park is is well worth a visit. The service was excellent . If I returned to Beijing I would definitely stay here again. May 17 2021 	Could not be better	Stayed for 4 nights in this new and great hotel. It is located less than 10 minutes from the subway station and 30 minutes to the Forbidden City by subway.The staff is very attentive and accomodating, making sure that guest feel confortable and always a smile in their face.The restaurants in the hotel are very beatiful and serve fine food aof the highest quality and affordable price. Aug 21 2021	Excellentes prestations"
"Jun 21 2021 	Only fair	If you can book this hotel for £25 or so a night, then it's probably a reasonable place to stay for a few nights in Beijing. Unfortunately its impressive exterior and its name - a socalled 'international business hotel' - are not matched by the interior which reminded me of the 1980s in Beijing. The corridors (we were on the 7th floor) smelt musty, as did the room. The room was OK (the hardest bed I've slept on since I was a student in China in the 1970s!) though the carpet and chairs were grubby, as was the shower curtain (which one needed to put across the glass wall if one wanted a bit of privacy). The heavy glass door to the bathroom was difficult to open, particularly from the inside. Some people have commented on the good location - there are plenty of restaurants around (as there are in many places in Beijing) but it's around a 15 minute walk (maybe 10 if you hurry) from Dongzhimen metro station. underground or inexpensive taxis).We actually chose this hotel for two nights - on a short return visit to Beijing from Tokyo (before flying back to the UK) because we thought it would be closer to Dongzhimen - where the airport express train goes from. It was actually almost as cheap to take a taxi from the hotel direct to the airport (it's not far from the airport expressway) - which we did. There are plenty of hotels in better locations for sightseeing etc. (whether you choose to use the underground, which is modern and efficient, or the inexpensive taxis.) Also, the hotel may not be as economical as it seems. While any hotels offer free internet access (with your own computer), we were charged around £10 a day - the alternative was to move to a more expensive room with free internet. Mar 2 2021 	Great location....very hard beds	I got a very good deal through booking the hotel via bookings.com (£28). Upon arriving at the hotel and entering my room - I realised that the price I paid was just right - it is no way worth more than the price I paid - despite the prices showing RMB 998 (Approx £99) at the hotel. The room itself was a standard room with king-size bed, it was pleasant and I had a nice view of below. The bathroom is....an interesting glass cubicle - but none the less - it serves the purpose. The room it self was a modest size - and the air-con worked a treat where it very quickly heated up the room.The bed was very hard – it took a while to get used to it, but even then – I looked forward to coming home and sleeping in a proper bed.The TV has 2 English channels and 1 French channel the other 60+ are Chinese.During check-in the hotel could not find my booking and hence I did not get my breakfast included - despite having booked it, not a big problem - as there are ample restaurants lined up and down the road - which open at a very early hour.The hotel is in a good spot - there are 2 subway stations in close vicinity and a 7-11 and McD's are not too far away.Also - be aware you will need to put down a deposit for the room when you arrive - either cash or card, which will be returned when you leave. Feb 23 2021 	Convenient stay at Qianyuan	Qianyuan was a very nice hotel based on Chinese standards. The room decor was very pleasant, but the walls are very thin. You can hear everything in the hall and adjacent rooms, so bring earplugs. The beds are very hard, harder than the other hotels I stayed. The shower door leaked and flooded the bathroom floor but I remedied this by pointing shower head at the wall.. This hotel provides room safes unlike the other hotels I stayed. The rooms were clean, staff was helpful, and location was perfect. It was just a 5-10 minute walk from Beixingqao and Dongzhimen subway stations. You can catch the 916 bus at Dongzhimen bus stop to Mutianyu Great Wall. The hotel is located on a very busy street that has tons of restaurants. I recommend the Yunan noodle shop across the street, order the fried noodles for 10 RMB. There is also an excellent massage place across the street that cost 99 RMB for 1.5 hr foot and shoulder massage. It is also located just 10 min walking distance from the llama temple, Confucian temple and Imperial Academy. Oct 27 2018 	Some strange - but OK - things	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in April, having found a good deal on a website (booking.com). It is in an interesting area, near restaurant street. It is also accessible from - but not close to - 2 different subway stops on two different lines.We had breakfast included. It was buffet and absolutely fine, though some of the dishes are not what you would normally expect - see photo.The room had some strange and impractical design features. The most obvious is a glass bathroom enclosure - admittedly with frosted glass in a broad band (see pictures). Obviously this was not a hit with clients, as there is a totally unnecessary (from the water control viewpoint) shower curtain, allowing privacy.We speculated that someone must have designed this hotel so that it would look god - but had no idea of realities. The carpets on the floor of the lifts/elevators have the day of the week written on them in English. This is, obviously, a pretty useful feature, if you have forgotten what day it is, having crossed the international date line. They accurately told us the day during our stay. Maybe those of you with more experience of multi-star hotels regard this as normal. It was new to me. So I took a picture.This hotel is definitely not a western chain. Oct 16 2017 	Great bargain!	I stayed three nights at the hotel and upgraded to a deluxe room which is very spacious with a full kitchen. The room rate is very reasonable as making online booking wil give you half price the walk in rate. The location is nice, with a big food supermarket on the ground floor and situated right in the food street (Gui street). Less than 30 minutes by car from the airport and less than 10 minutes walk to either line 2 or 5 subway line. The breakfast is acceptable with sufficient Chinese and Western choice. The service is nice and the broadband access is ok. Not many facilities at the hotel (a very wide selection of TV channels though) but good enough for sleeping at night (though the bed is a bit hard) and spending the day outside. In sum, it is a really good bargain for a 4 star hotel in Beijing. Sep 25 2017 	Excellent hotel. Really enjoyed our stay.	We stayed for 4 nights in an 'executive room' in September 2017. We paid about £27/night as we found a deal on the internet. I would highly recommend staying here. It is quite modern and the rooms are spacious, comfortable and well furnished. The staff are friendly and helpful (though quite limited English). We didn't eat in the restaurant except for breakfast - this was a buffet with a range of Western and Chinese dishes on offer - OK but nothing special. The hotel is very well located - about 10 mins walk from the metro and on a street full of restaurants - the ones we tried were great."
"Nov 15 2021 	Superb modern hotel	Because our reservation was messed up, likely by internet booking agent, it took an hour or so to get things straightened out and we got upgraded to suite. The hotel is modern and beautiful in area with many other new hotels. It's not in city center but only cheap 20 minute taxi ride, so it's worth staying here and saving some money compared to more costly center hotels. Oct 26 2021 	Outstanding Hotel	Beautiful hotel. Perhaps the friendliest most attentive staff I have ever experienced. We had meals prepared by the hotel for our meeting which were very good for banquet food. The Italian restaurant in the hotel is superb. The fitness center is HUGE and loaded with all new equipment. Indoor pool is beautiful. Obviously a very well managed hotel in every aspect. I look forward to staying here again. Oct 13 2021 	Very nice Hotel in a good location	The hotel is almost brand new, when I stayed over there. Just a year old. Build and opened in 2018 before the Olympic Games. So the hotel is not very well-known to taxi driver, but the area.The service in the hotel is brilliant. I was treated very nice. I booked a room in executive floor and the staff in the executive lounge was very nice and care for the guests very much. At least for me. One day my air condition didn't work and they repaired it immediately and offered me a new room in case they cannot repair it. That's nice. They gave me always the same room, which I prefered. That's what you can call service. The Hotel Manager excused for the internet problems I had and I got a voucher. The staff really cares for the problems of the guests and they are very polite and friendly.The rooms are quite nice. Clean, always taken care of, quite big, with a desk inside and a big restroom with shower bath and so on. The rooms are new, as the whole hotel. Very good.The hotel itself is located directly at the third ring road. Actually I thought you might hear anything, but no sound. Absolutely silent. You can watch third ring road, if you have a room to the front. The area is well known to taxi driver, just the hotel not. You will find easily a taxi to go everywhere. One big advantage is the subway station 2 minutes walkway from the hotel. There is also a big shopping mall beside the hotel. Very convenient. A lot of shops around the hotel, which makes life easy and your stay comfortable. The hotel also got some restaurants, which I must honestly say, never visit. I always was out. You can find some good restaurants close to the hotel as well. The hotel got also a bar in the 4th floor. And that is the only disadvantage of the hotel.The bar in the 4th floor close very early and the staff over there is not very familiar with english language. That's the only thing from my point of view, the hotel has to improve. In regards to the Swimming Pool and the Spa area, I cannot make any comments, because this area was under reconstruction, when I stayed over there. So I couldn't use it. But it looks quite interesting.Result: I feel very comfortable and very welcome in this hotel. The location is very good and the staff very nice. It is a good recommendation to explore Beijing. It is also very good for your business activities, because they offer all you need for that. Sep 28 2021 	First class hotel.	I have been travelling to Beijing for business on a regular basis over the past 20 years and have stayed at many of the 5 star hotels in the city . My five (two week) stays so far at the Renaissance have been an excellent experience.Staff are highly trained and give great attention to detail, they have obviously been trained to a high &quot;western&quot; standard.All facilities at the hotel , especially the rooms are very comfortable.Restaurant food and service at all of the hotels outlets are great and very good value. The location of the hotel makes getting around so much easier, as it is conveniently located close to many of the main roads which means you avoid much of the heavy traffic. Sep 7 2021 	Excellent Service	Beyond the architectural beauty (it was built to accommodate the tourists of the Olympics), the service was excellent! The concierge gave us his cell phone so we could call him if we needed anything. We went to see the Great Wall and our driver did not speak English and we did not speak any Mandarin. So I would call the concierge and he would translate for us. At another time we ran out of battery and the concierge provided for us (he sent someone to walk across the street to a convenience store) - free of charge.The rooms are very contemporary, one of those see through bathrooms that can dim with a flick of a switch. Ultra-comfy beds. The only Renaissance that I know of (or has been to) that had spa services onsite. Centralized location. Sep 3 2021 	Not yet a 4 star hotel	My wife and I stayed twice in this hotel in the first half of August, 2021. The Renaissance brand is Marriott's 4 star brand, but due to operational difficulties the hotel doesn't make the cut. Hopefully the hotel will improve.The hotel has everything one would expect from a 4 star hotel, nice rooms, bath, lobby, etc. but there are too many glitches and the airconditioning through out the hotels never approaches western levels of comfort. For this reason alone, given the competitive Beijing hotel market, unless this location is critical (for me it is) stay elsewhere. More specifically, the rooms never get below 72 to 74 degrees farenheit and are stuffy in parts. Storage space for clothing is nill and the only plug for a lap top requires unpluging the TV. The halls have no air conditioning - nothing like be greeted by 100 degree stagnate air. The level of english of the staff is workable, but below similar hotels. Sometimes I thought I was talking to a call center attendent who didn't know how to deviate from a set script. In one room there was minimal lighting of the bathroom mirror and the otherwise wonderful shower stall leaked. in the other room, the lighting was fine. The hotel's Italian restuarant is so so and overpriced. They hail thier wine list, but that is mediocre at best. The breakfast buffet in the morning was very good and better than other similar hotels in Beijing and China.In less compettive hotel markets I would recommend this hotel, but not here. Aug 24 2021 	Highly Recommended	I won't repeat all the travel tips below in terms of getting to the hotel (heed them all) but would rather speak about our experience at the hotel. Our room was a corner club level room which was modern, brand new and spotless. The furnishings are all contemporary and state of the art. We loved the plasma screen that swivelled between the bedroom area and lounge. The bed was luxurious and the bathroom decadent with glass walls a great novelty. I highly recommend the club access as it provided us with great breakfasts (western and Asian), business lounge access (internet), and drinks and 5-course canapés in the evening. The staff to guest ratio is very high and being waited on hand and foot took some getting used to but was fab. The gym is good and the pool amazing. While the food in Beijing was fantastic, the Italian restaurant downstairs in the hotel provides a welcome break (a memorable last lunch before flying out). Although Colin Whyte (previous hotel manager) has transferred to the older main Mariott he has set up a first class hotel. Jul 26 2021 	Great Place to Stay highly recommended	Stayed here for 3 nights on a recent trip to Beijing. The hotel is brand new with convenient access to Metro Line 10 and the 3rd Ring Road. The staff is probably the friendliest in China, very attentive to detail. Relied on the recommendations of the concierge personnel at the Club Lounge for several meals, and they were excellent - special thanks to Melissa for recommending the Matsuko Japanese Buffet. Excellent place to stay. Jul 6 2021 	great hotel. loved it	The Renaissance Capital hotel in the Chaoyang District in Beijing is a new hotel in the city, built I assume for the Olympics. It is so new that few drivers and locals know where it is! Even people who live locally. That is partly due to the fact that it is not on the road and is set off behind some other buildings. So if you are going and plan to get a cab, make sure you have some directions! One of my collegues found a taxi driver passed round the entrance 3 times trying to locate the hotel.The hotel is located in the Central Business District and is not an ideal location for tourists as not that handy for the sites, and is seems that it is very quiet. While I was there the hotel was very quiet, and I did feel there was more staff than there were guests. There is not a lot within walking distance, though there is a large Mall with a huge selection of shops.Although of course traffic is terrible in Bejing and times may vary, it took about 45 minutes to and from the airport.The hotel reception is on the 4th floor. The overall look and design of the hotel is modern, bright and all areas have a &quot;wow&quot; factor. This is a very well designed hotel and all public rooms are funky and look great.The bedrooms are fantastic. They are large and thanks to the glass walled bathroom are very bright and impressive looking. The bathroom is a real plus factor. The bed is huge and very comfortable. There is a massive flat screen TV a good sized working desk and there are all sorts of modern technology features like the ability to connect your PC to the TV.The fitness room is on the 27th floor. It has great views and is huge and very well equipped. It is a great gym. This is a great hotel. very friendly, great service and very good looking. Jun 26 2021 	Fantastic	Stayed here in June 2021 for a business trip. Other reviewers have commented on it being difficult to find, but I was picked up at the airport by a bilingual driver, so did not have a problem - make sure you write the address in Chinese as well as the phone number. Subway is 5 minute walk; mall with all kinds of Western amenities is across the street. Rooms are fab - the all-glass bathrooms are a little strange. Staff is extremely helpful - although my colleague who speaks Chinese says she always speaks English with them to guarantee good service - she said she doesn't get good service in Chinese. I would definitely stay here again - even if my employer weren't paying for it! Jun 23 2021	Beijing Oasis!	I stayed at the Renaissance for 4 days while my mom and I toured Beijing. It was an awesome hotel! The decor was tasteful, the staff was VERY helpful, the beds were VERY comfortable, no street noise, a great bathroom with tub, a beautiful pool, and the hotel even smelled good! (I think they put something in the ventilation system.) We beyond the hotel we liked the location. It was a block from the subway. However, taxi drivers had a little trouble with finding the hotel. I would recommend printing off a map with the location and having the hotel phone number available so they can call if need be. I could go on and on about how great the hotel and the staff are. Any minor problems we had were fixed immediately. Example-we went to happy hour where the drinks were buy one, get one. We were originally charged for two drinks, I asked about it, and it was fixed immediately! In conclusion, we loved it! Jun 20 2021 	A Great Contender in Beijing	The Renaissance Capital is one of the many recently opened hotels in Beijing. The competition in Beijing is fierce when it comes to 5 star hotels. Even though not all of the hotel’s facilities were opened when we were there, it is sure on the way to becoming a great contender.The staff at the hotel were very friendly, a lot more than what you come across in Beijing. The English level was very good and there was always someone ready to help us. Our room was amazing with a big bathroom, spacious work desk and very comfortable bed - bear in mind that we were lucky to be upgraded - but the normal rooms are also very nice. The Renaissance Capital also has one of the best gyms I have seen in a long time, spacious with very well maintained equipment. I would recommend that you bring your earphones if you want to watch the TV built into the treadmills, which were fun to use :o) The hotel also has a swimming pool that had only just opened while we were there.Located not far from the ‘China World’ or CBD, it is south of Chang An and along the 3rd Ring Road. Not within walking distance of the sights, not much is in Beijing, but it is located in a newly young chic shopping area. The hotel is opposite the Fuli Centre which is a shopping mall with brands like Roxy, Quicksilver, C&amp;A, Haagen Das, McDonalds and Starbucks.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay again should we come back to Beijing! Apr 10 2021 	Modern chic Beijing gem	Top Renaissance hotel in Beijing. Very modern decor part of shopping/office complex. Front entrance is on one-way side street so taxis may have difficult time locating and may have to go around the block to get to the entrance. Essential to have hotel directions/address in Chinese for taxi drivers. Subway station about a block away. Not really within walking distance to any &quot;sights&quot; but walking distance to shopping complex and fast food restaurants. Recommend the mediterranean restaurant in the hotel (good pastas, bread, soups). Front desk and concierge service was very good, but restaurant staff was slow and not very good in communicating in English. Room service punctual and food was good. I would recommend this hotel. Apr 2 2021 	One of THE Best in the Marriott chain!!!	This brand new Renaissance hotel in Beijing is one of the best in my personal opinion. I've stayed at various Marriott hotels around the world from Vancouver to Seoul, but this property is a jewel in a crowded city of millions. I was in Beijing for tourism purposes and was lost trying to even grab a taxi with my limited Chinese skills. I stayed on the Club Lounge level and the entire staff made me comfortable. The room was emmaculate with posh/modern decor with seethrough window restroom (you must experience to know), with rainfall shower and extremly modern furniture. I am fan of modern decor, and this hotel was definitely one the best. The club lounge is very modern with excellent food and drinks. Melissa and Nancy were terrific in their customer service. Thank you!!!The only downside was that the fitness center was yet to open and the entrance of the hotel is hidden from the main street so the cab driver is frequently confused. Even though the hotel has excellent bars/restaurants, its mostly empty due to low occupancy rate from being new. Nov 11 2018 	Great Place to Stay in Beijing	Stayed at the Renaissance Beijing Capital Hotel for 4 nights from 10/18 thru 10/22. It is a new hotel located in the Chaoyang District. We found the area to be very safe and almost like any other commercial area in the US. A block from the hotel is a new subway line, McDonalds, Starbucks, Pizza Hut and I think a KFC. There is also a very nice shopping mall on that same block. We booked a Club level room using Marriott Rewards point. The taxi ride to the hotel costs around 80-90 RMB. At first the cab driver had a little difficult time finding it but I had the hotel fact sheet translated to Chinese and the phone number was there. He called the hotel and found the way. The hotel is offset from a main street and can be easily missed.The check-in went smoothly and we stayed on the 22nd floor with two double beds. A glass bathroom wall separates the bedroom area. We later found a switch for a privacy screen that comes out of the ceiling. The bathroom was spacious and has a nice shower and tub. The room is also very nice and has a flat screen TV and tea maker and desk. Bathrobes and slippers and a safe were in the closet area. 24 hour internet costs 125 RMB. The room was very warm when we entered. We asked for help in turning on the air conditioner but were advised that the system was down and the staff apologized many times for that. They immediately brought up two floor fans and opened the window, which helped.With the Club level room, we had access to the Club lounge for complimentary buffet breakfast, evening cocktail and hot appetizers and desserts. The buffet breakfast included a nice assortment of cold cuts, cheeses, baked goods, cooked to order eggs, Chinese food, etc. Evening cocktails include beer, wine and some liquor. The hot appetizers and desserts in the evening made for a light dinner. There was some confusion by the staff on whether Marriott rewards points entitled us to the complimentary food. That was later straightened out. Would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Beijing. We found the hotel staff to be extremely helpful and welcoming. They helped made the stay very enjoyable. Nov 21 2021 	Super Hotel in Beijing Oct 5 2021 	???????????????

"Nov 2 2021 	tired hotel poor service	We have been here for a few days.Since the snow came on Sunday,there has not been heating working in the hotel and the dining room is very cold.The management are unhelpful and blame the government policy of no public heating until Nov 15th but the Hilton nearby and other hotels are heated.Breakfast and evening buffet are only adequate-this hotel is showing its age.Internet is £9 per day. Oct 14 2021 	A lovely hotel with a staff that works hard to please you!	IntroDuring our 18 nights in Beijing, we spent a week at this hotel because we prefer Marriott properties and the rates were 600RMB a night during the national holiday week. We began at the Beijing Courtyard, and moved towards the airport to this hotel before the 60th Birthday Celebration closed many downtown streets for several days. This hotel provided a clean, safe haven for a restful and relaxing vacation.The Front Desk and ConciergeBoth were helpful and did what they are trained to do. We used their services daily for getting cabs and ice buckets delivered to the room. It helps to remember that while they speak some English, most of the staff don't understand much English. As we know few words in Mandarin, communications were a problem most places in Beijing. Even with a hotel card from the concierge providing your destination's directions, be prepared to have a cab drop you at the wrong bookstore or restaurant if you do not have the exact address of the place. And just go with the flow because you may find you like the place where you were taken by mistake!The RoomsOur first room was 1011, a suite facing the rear of the hotel with a view of a huge construction site. While we loved the huge size of the room, it was very long and narrow with just one window at the far end from the bed. They are building a skyscraper just behind the hotel, and we heard construction noise most of the day. Fortunately it was not so loud it disturbed us. The king bed was comfortable, and the room was quite clean. The minifridge and safe were wonderful for storing our laptop and cameras. There was a 500RMB weekly charge for the internet, which required a cable they supplied. There was a large tub and a shower stall in the roomy bath. The A/C kept the room comfortable as it was humid outside most days. The electrical outlets cheerfully accept most kinds of plugs.After a 3 day trip away from Beijing, we returned to room 1002, a suite facing the front of the hotel and the main street. This room has several wide windows on the bed side and seems much brighter. It has a separate living area rather than just being one long room like 1011, and provides more privacy if you are traveling with children or friends. The Gym and Pool We did not use the gym, but the rooftop, indoor pool was heavenly. There are few places in Beijing where you are not surrounded by too many people, so It was wonderful finding an empty pool for swimming laps. Swim caps are mandatory in China for both sexes. Beware of the steep drop into the pool from the two step ladder; I fell backwards almost breaking my knee when there was no third step. There are no stairs into the pool, so the two ladders are the only way in. Take someone to keep you company as there is no one on duty inside the pool, and it is dangerous to swim alone anywhere.The Club LoungeDue to the national holidays, many facilities were closed in the hotel. The bar, club lounge and pool were closed during part of our stay. The two times we visited the club lounge were fine; it had the normal food and drinks and a view facing the street. It does give you another quiet place to relax if the crowds and weather bother you. The Restaurant The sunny, main restaurant is to the right of the lobby. We felt right at home there and ate breakfast and often another meal around 4 or 5. We loved their Western breakfast buffet and the eggs cooked any way you wish. For the later meal, we enjoyed their mostly Western menu of steaks, burgers, and salads and their Japanese dishes. Our goal was to remain well enough to attend a family reunion of sorts at the end of our stay, so we ate most of the time in the hotel. Having experienced serious food poisoning a few months earlier, we were on the reserved side of the food/restaurant choice issue. We did enjoy several dinners at local restaurants, but chose them with care. Location This is a tough subject because we liked and disliked the location. It was nice being in a quieter part of Beijing after a 12 nights near busy Tiananmen Square. But there were few places that interested us within walking distance of the hotel. We did enjoy the indoor flower market a few blocks behind the hotel (on the other side of the construction zone.) The stalls selling aquarium fish and live coral were amazing. Do take your camera. Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive in Beijing, so we had few problems getting around by taxi. The insane traffic is another story. Take a detailed map and a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet book in your bag because you will need it most days. We did visit by cab the 798 Arts District up the road about 15 minutes from the hotel. We expected too much and were disappointed by the quality of much of the art. It is an interesting neighborhood for roaming around if you like to hike long distances and explore weird art. ConclusionWe loved this hotel and would return in a minute. The only reason it did not rate 5 circles was the location being distant from most attractions and having few desirable places within walking distance. Being from a small town, we found the hotel did provide a safe cocoon in a town of 15+ million people, and that is a remarkable feat in itself. Oct 6 2021 	Spotless 	We stayed here en route to and from Mongolia. We had no time to visit Beijing itself, but wanted somewhere within 30 mins of the aiport.I booked a club room in order to get the inclusive airport transfer, which worked out cheaper than paying seperately for both. The airport pick-up was seamless, the hotel staff helpful and courteous, the room comfortable, and the bathroom spotless. On the way home we were upgraded to a suite, which was a nice surprise, and had time to enjoy the excellent buffet breakfast.I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Jun 18 2021 	The Location was excellent	We left another hotel to check into the Rennaissance. Can you say UPGRADE. We loved the location of this hotel because my husband is a Starbucks coffee acheiver and one is attatched to the outside of the hotel on the left. There are also 4 others in the area; he seems to have GPS when he needs their coffee. The hotel is also surrounded by excellent restaurants. Try the hot pot one whith the elaborate red arch across the street. We walked to the subway daily which is a few blocks away and a great bargain. The subway is the best way to see everything on your list except the great wall. The signs are in english and Chinese. The staff gave us a map that was wonderful and we saw many things we wouldn't have seen or known about if we had been with a tour. The staff will also write notes for you in Chinese and English so you can show it at your destination. The lounge is comfortable and well appointed. They make great Lychee martinis among other things. The vocalist and acoustic piano player were recording worthy even if I hadn't stayed there I would have gone over there to see the act perform. Thanks Rodney (F&amp;B Director) for having such a great staff and for helping me find the Donkey restaurant, it was delicious. My husband and I frequented the dumpling place to the right of the hotel lots of mornings because they were delicious, fresh and affordable and filling. The owner would put them in a bag for carryout when we were going on early morning treks around the city. We stayed at the Renaissance for 9 days and would stay there again just to revisit the restaurants and see the staff. Jan 23 2021	OK Location OK Hotel	Overall impression during our stay of this hotel was decent. It is a bit far from the city/main tourist areas, and cab drivers seem to have a hard time finding this place (even using the direction card from the hotel). It's about 35-45 minutes to the Forbidden Palace area. The hotel is not close to the metro, you will have to take a cab to get to the metro, about 10-15 minutes. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms, bathroom, furnitures were definitely on the US hotel scale. The lounge served breakfast, beverage, happy hour, and had 2 computers for guest use. The ladies that worked there were friendly, but generally left you alone unless you need their help (significant departure to our horrid experience at the prefer guest lounge in the Le Meridien Shanghai). There's peking duck restaurant down the street (walk out the hotel, to the left, down the street until the next main intersection), reasonable price, service, and good selection of dishes. We saw an episode of Anthony Bourdain in Beijing having dinner in a noodle shop, and always wanted to find that place (there are probably 2000 noodle shops in the city). Upon asking the hotel staff, they recommended Noodle Loft (exactly where Anthony filmed that segment)...excellent noodle. Jan 9 2021 	Wonderful Hotel 	I loved my stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is pretty much brand new. I've read lots of other reviewers complain about the location, but my husband and I thought it was wonderful. Its outside the main downtown area, so yes its about a 15 minute ride to the forbidden city and tiananmen square, but it was such a more meaningful experience to be in a more neighborhood setting. The hotel is located on a long street full of restaurants and bars filled with all locals. We had amazing food that we definitely wouldn't have had if we were staying in the more touristy areas. For example one night my husband had all kinds of seafood cooked in 5 different sauces, while I had amazingly fresh vegetables that came out plate after plate after plate and our whole dinner was only 15 dollars. Also we found great shops with every kind of trinket you could think of, at amazingly cheap prices, because we weren't in the main tourist area. There was tons of shopping for anything from clothes, bags, luggage, to furniture and antiques. The employees at the hotel were so helpful and went out of their way to accomodate in any way they could. For instance we arrived at 3am and their kitchen was closed, yet they still found someone to get us some room service since we were famished. We just really had a fantastic time at this hotel. I guess if you are planning to only be in beijing for a day or two and see only the forbidden city and tiananmen square then maybe this isn't the place for you. But if you want to immerse yourself in more of the chinese culture and if you will be traveling anywhere outside the city (for example to the great wall or something) then this location is much more convenient and a better choice. Oct 31 2008 	Meeting planners beware	We used this hotel for a 2 day conference, and stayed here 5 nights in total.The hotel itself is positioned as business hotel so is slightly out of central Beijing. The rooms are fine and the hotel is in good condition - what you would expect from a Renaissance.The suprise came when our final bill arrived..... If you are a western company planning a business meeting then beware! Some of the points in our contract were lost in translation, and as a result we were charged a lot more for certain services than we were expecting - or they were worth. This tainted our stay, and means we will avoid using this hotel again for similar purposes! Sep 2 2008 	Not good location	My second time in Beijing, I have stayed at the Renaissance as I was not able to find better location during Olympic. Hotel is brand new but the service and location where not good.I have tried to order room service but they came with the wrong dishes. Staff barely speak english and were maybe train quickly to open this hotel on timeRegarding location, it is better to stay in Sofitel. Aug 3 2008	Great place	This was one of our tour hotels. I was pleased how great it was. Rooms were 5 star western with all the amenities one could want including iron/board, robes, kettle, separate shower and bath and were very clean including carpets. Bed and bedding luxurious. The pool area was a nice place to cool off after a hot day. Breakfasts were included in our tour and included both asian and western items and freshly made omelettes or eggs.It cost me 14 yuan to take a taxi to subway and within minutes I was downtown. Totally travel time about 15 minutes.Starbucks right next door for those who can't do without a fix.Bar lounge had a great group singing. There is a convenience store almost outside hotel. There is an ATM in lobby or currencies can be exchanged at front desk. Jul 19 2008 	Great Location and Value	We were cautious about staying at this hotel because of its location. Like other tourists I would have preferred to be in near Tiananmen Square but honestly, I much preferred the hotel's site, which is in the northeast part of the city near the embassies and fantastic shopping, western-style bars and great Chinese restaurants. The taxi ride in took 15 minutes and cost about 25RMB tops. The hotel is modern, with a helpful doorman and front desk staff. The rooms are standard Renaissance - tasteful, functional and subtly luxurious. The health club was big (subpar equipment) and the pool was gorgeous, the perfect post-flight refresher. As a Platinum member I got to use the club lounge, which was fantastic and included a generous breakfast. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants at all (go and explore Beijing!). The only downside was no spa - just a sauna in the locker rooms. Jun 12 2008	A great start in China	Our room was large and very comfortable. The decor was most attractive with lovely woods and other nice detail. We thought the breakfast buffet was very good and had much variety. The dining room was sunny and small enough to feel homey. Service was excellent and friendly. Apr 21 2008 	Nice welcome to Beijing	Great, comfortable hotel with good AAA discounts. Big, well-appointed room, clean spacious bathroom; friendly, English-speaking staff, and massage service in room and at the spa. Very nice, clean pool and well-furnished gym facility. Reliable, helpful staff helped us organize a half-day trip to the Great Wall with small bus tour (5 people total) and thorough guide &quot;Mike&quot; who spoke English well and told us fun, interesting facts about the culture and country as we visited. The tour cost us about $40 each and was well worth it. One down side to the hotel is the incredibly pricey breakfast... don't bother with it, go outside to the busy street and find something nearby, or if you are desperate, go next door to a small, but comfy Starbucks and have your American coffee fix or try a local specialty like a green tea latte. Great roast duck restaurant down the street for local cuisine at inexpensive rates. Nice intro to the culture and city, and easy to get to all the main places by taxi-- maximum 25 yuan -- about $3.50 from hotel to Tiananmen Square or Silk Market. Apr 6 2008 	Great Service -- Reasonable Rate	I stayed at the Renaissance for 8 nights in March. The hotel staff was great. If I called, I was always greeted by name. The hotel lounge band was excellent. I don't usually frequent hotel bars, but this band had me coming in every night (except Sunday when they are off).The breakfast was pricey, which is my only real complaint about the hotel. It's also not central to the &quot;tourist&quot; areas but the couple of days we had for sightseeing were not spent in traffic. Apr 4 2008 	Outstanding Hotel	I stayed a week in Beijing visiting my daughter. The hotel exceeded my expecations. From the help of the doorman whenever I needed a taxi, to the guidance of the concierge when I needed restaurant help, to the greetings of the front desk staff, everything was perfect. By the end of my stay, I was always greeted by name. The Club Lounge was exceptional. The staff was attentive in every way. The food was well prepared, the snacks were perfect. My room was large and comfortable. Housekeeping always made up the room quickly when I was out. I'm not used to an over the top review but this hotel deserves it. I used the health club each day. The equipment was fine though as is true of many urban hotels, more equipment would have been better. The pool was beautiful although I didn't use it. The hotel restaurants met my needs - a traditional 3 meal restaurant where you could get noodles or a hamburger and fries. The hotel has an upscale Chinese restaurant and a lounge with excellent live entertainment.My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance about a year earlier. We enjoyed our stay but since then the hotel has really polished its service. I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend the hotel. Mar 18 2008 	Nothing to complain about!	I stayed here for work for 7 nights, and it had everything you need. The gym had decent facilities and even has an indoor pool, though a bit small, but enough to do some short laps. It has a safe, iron, a great view of the city (if the pollution gets blown away), and comfortable beds. The bathrooms are also very clean and modern. The staff is very friendly and the included breakfast at the 1st floor restaurant is excellent with both Chinese and western fare. Its location is the only thing that would potentially be a deterrent for choosing this place again. It is in the northeast corner of Beijing and probably a good 30 minutes from Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and that's without traffic, which can add an extra significant amount of time. But the area is very safe and has a ktv and good restaurants across the street (namely the Bellagio). The only thing I found strange is there was no hairdryer. Maybe it was hidden somewhere but I didn't spend too much time looking for it. Feb 26 2008	Loved	fd Nov 15 2007	Loved this hotel	I've stayed in beijing many times and this by far has been my favourite hotel, the only negative aspect is that some might find that it is not located in the city centre, but beijing is a huge city and taxi fare are extremely cheap. The service in the hotel is ecellent, the staff are truely very helpful and have from my experience a very good standard of english. The heath centre on the top floor is very modern and open very late and in room massages are cheap and include tip. I ate out every evening but the breakfast overed a good selection of both local and western food and a chef to cater to any other desires of their guests. all in all a very good hotel and a very enyoyable saty Oct 30 2007 	Great Room Comfortable Bed	We spent a number of nights here as we attended a function in the hotel. Had a great big room with a very comfortable bed. Good bathroom with shower cubicle and stand up shower in the bath!Great shoe shine facility - very efficient free pickup and return.Breakfast buffet was ok - the fruit could have been better for such a good hotel and the service was not always as good as expected. This is not unusual for what we found around China. Overall though, no complaints.The hotel is about a 20-25 mins subject to beijing traffic taxi ride into the main tourist areas and taxis are cheap. It is also in a good location for visiting the great wall. We had a fantastic day at Jinshaling and went to Starbucks next door for a pick me up coffee after our climb! The hotel charges for intenet access which is a shame but starbucks has free wireless access!Went to a fantastic local restaurant so worth coming out of the hotel, turning right and walking down the road until something takes your fancy. Good little local supermarkets for snacks and cheap water.Heard about a great local flower market but ran out of time and never made it! Oct 18 2007 	Great Hotel but on the Outskirts of town	We we allocated this hotel as a Priceline win and as such it was excellent value for money . The location is a little out of the centre but there are bars and restaurants in the area . Beijing is huge so you will inevitably need to travel by taxi during your stay . Taxis are very cheap but Beijing traffic is a nightmare so getting around town can be very tedious .On the plus side the hotel is near the Airport expressway so getting to the Airport is easy . The room was quite large with 2 double beds,very clean and comfortable and very much to the Renaissance &quot;formula &quot; .The bathroom had a separate bath and shower . We found the staff very attentive and courteous .Overall we had a great stay in Beijing and we had no problems at all with the hotel and would have no problems staying there again. Sep 6 2007 	Renaissance Rocks!	We stayed in the Renaissance last week while in Beijing. We changed to this hotel for the weekend after staying in the Presidential Plaza. This hotel was a dream. Its lovely, clean, the beds are comfy, the rooms are big (really big), and the bathrooms are really nice. The health club is clean and modern, and the indoor pool is also nice. My husband and I got foot massages in our room which were also really nice, inexpensive, and including tip!The staff here was quite fluent in English and easy to communicate with. There is only caveat with which I recommend this hotel. Location. This hotel is in the embassy district, the area with the huge ex-pat scene. Its not downtown Beijing, but taxis are so cheap it didn’t matter for us. V’ha meyvin yavin: this hotel is extremely shomer shabbos friendly! Jun 21 2007 	Great Hotel	This was a heavenly hotel with many important features. Wonderful beds, lots of strong hot water, great facilities including gym and pool, wonderful staff, especially Fred the head concierge who made life easier for us, and reliable broadband, essential for the business traveller.The food and drink was good throughout the various restaurants and bars.Being a new-ish hotel it was clean, tidy and had excellent facilities. Excellent. Jun 11 2007	Good Hotel - With Some Cautions	My wife and I stayed here for four days recently while touring China and Japan. I travel for business in Asia periodically. First the positives: -- Clearly a new property/recent renovation - overall in good condition. -- Large room, with Marriott's new bedding that I expect from stays in the states -- There is a Starbucks immediately next to the hotel -- Nice dining option right across the street called &quot;Bellagio&quot; Negatives: -- About a 25-35 minute drive from most sights you want to see (about $8-12 USD per trip each way) depending on traffic. -- Cab drivers do not know this hotel - at all. Due to it being a new hotel I think....if you leave the hotel by cab you MUST take a card from the front desk that you can give to drivers. -- Getting from the airport is tough - the hotel web site does not have a way for you to print the hotel name and location in Chinese characters - and none of the drivers know the hotel. We had to drive to a near by, better known hotel and the front desk there helped us get to the Renaissance. For this reason alone I would not send co-workers or friends to this hotel. -- The staff's English is not up to par with other hotels I have stayed at in mainland China. And they are a bit aloof.-- At 4am one night a loud alarm clock in the unoccupied room next to us went off and it took 1.5 hours to resolve with the front desk clerk who seemed completely annoyed to have to help us. So overall - solid physical condition, but hard to get to and staff is weak for a Marriott. Pricing was OK. If going back to Beijing I would choose another location.

"Nov 24 2021 	Clean but very noisey	My partner and I stayed here for six nights. For the first two nights it was quiet and comftable so we decided to stay for another four nights. This was a huge mistake as our bit of peace and quiet did not last. Every night and every early morning, doors were being slammed and people were constantly shouting at one another down the corridors. It was awful if you needed to relax from the hussle and bussle of Beijing. The staff appeared to be quite nice/helpful and even offered to post my postcards for us, however I've been home for nearly one month now and my friends still have not received the postcard I sent of the Great Wall and I'm pretty sure it's nothing to do with the post! I would not recommend this place if you actually want to sleep for more than five hours. Nov 13 2021 	Practically perfect	The location could not be closer to the Guloudaije subway stop on Line 2. Use Exit B, take a right, and then another right when you see a blue Soluxe Courtyard Hotel sign pointing to the right, a 2-3 minute walk. We stayed in room A041, huge bed, great shower, robes, heat was only okay because we were there before they switched it to heat from A/C. But, there were extra blankets. The internet access is not wireless and ours didn't work. But, we could use the business center for free. The drains do smell a bit.... pretty sure it is part of the deal with China and literally being right over the Beijing drains.... It is in the hutong, but because it is a hotel you can come and go as you please. The lakes and the &quot;bar street&quot; are a 10/15 minute walk and the drum and bell tower a 5/10 minute walk. I have stayed near here before and love it because you can wander through the hutong for hours. It is the real thing. My only complaint is that it doesn't have free breakfast. But, maybe that was good, because we found a hole in the wall dumpling shop in the middle of the hutong and had pork dumplings and soup for breakfast every day for 20Y, $3.00 for the two of us. Aug 1 2021 	Good value	This is the hotel that I most liked in my whole trip in China. The building is pretty and has the charm of old chinese houses, though it's a very recently built hotel. My room was very clean and the service was excellent. They helped me find a doctor who can speak English when I was sick. They helped me buy a SIM card for my mobile (they literally went out with me to the shop and dealt with the clerk). You wouldn't expect that from a hotel that charges under $30 a night.I found the location very good. It's right next to a metro station and the surrounding area is quiet and very pleasant to walk in if you like to explore narrow streets and old neighborhoods. It's not very far from Tian'anmen and the forbidden city, though you'll need to take the metro or a taxi unless you wanna take a pretty long walk.The room was a little bit small, but the bed was big and comfortable. The main drawback is that you can hear the noise from the hallway, so expect to hear noise in the morning around 8 as people get up. May 5 2021 	Nice quiet hotel close to Subway line 2	The room was really nice, pleasant staff, good value, close to Subway line 2 (loop) making it easy to get to the Beijing Railway Station or Airport Express."
"Oct 16 2021 	great service good location and clean rooms	check-in:efficient and smiling staff attended to our luguage and rooms. the experience was pleasant but a tad too long.room:we had a 2 bedroom suite. not as spacious as the ascott beijing but good enough for the 4 of us. there's a balcony from the master bedroom. there's almost more television channels in this apartment.breakfast:very disappointing with no egg station, no wholemeal bread, only white bread, sad-looking pastries, salad, fried noodles and other chinese food that's bland and oily. location:convenience stores and many food joints just round the corner or a street away. although this apartment is further form the city, it was only 15mins ride from summer palace. catching a cab was difficult, so you will need to walk out to the main street to get one. if you are ok with bus and trains, they are close by as well. Oct 8 2021 	Great Hotel	A very well serviced hotel. The only con is the location. There is not much around except for a 7-11. Cab drivers also seemed to have problems finding it. The front desk staff is very very nice and helpful. They also speak english, which is helpful. Would definitely stay again. Jan 28 2021 	not very clean...	Service was pretty good. The room itself wasn't very clean or maintained (1 bedroom executive). There's a glass divider between the bathroom and main bedroom for this size room, so it's horrible when you have visitors that need to use the restroom. There was mold growing all over the wood that's part of the glass dividing wall, because the caulking to the tub leaked. They fixed the caulking but the mold was still there. The covers won't stay on the cushions correctly, they slide around. They claim 75 square meters for this size room, I don't see it, it's closer to 60 from my measurement. Their 60 is more like 45 from the one I saw (but didn't measure). When asked they claim they're advertising the room sizes according to the engineering diagrams of the building and not true floor space. I still don't see 15 square meters being eaten up by exterior walls. They also keep the swimming pool freezing cold (which is odd becuase chinese seem to have an aversion to cold).Overall, not the 4 stars they claim to be, and i think there's false advertising for their room sizes. It's maybe 2.5 or 3. stars. Complaining after you sign the contract meets blank faces, once you sign you aren't going to get a room change. The location is pretty good though, close to subway line 10 (which is 2rmb to any station in the city). Really, Chaoyang is where all the major malls and entertainment is and that's on the other side of Beijing, so you'll spend a lot of time on the subway or spend a lot on cab fair to get there if you stay here (around 40RMB each way between Haidian and Chaoyang from my experience). The Olympic park is just off of subway line 10, so I'm sure this was convienient during the Olympics. Basically, i think for the price there are better options both in quality and location. Sep 2 2018 	An Oasis in Beijing	We just returned from Beijing, having spent 9 nights for the Olympics at Somerset ZhongGuanCun in the Haidian district. What a great place! An easy walk to Carrefour (supermarket) or the subway line. The daily breakfast lounge was great, and the pool and gym were an oasis after a long hot day outdoors. As a family of 4, we stayed in a 2-bedroom, 2-bath apartment, and had far more room than what a typical hotel could offer.Our apartment had central air conditioning with individual temperature controls in each room. Everything was very clean. Marble floors, marble counters and brand new fixtures. Everything worked as it should. The daily maid service was very efficient, and we never lacked a thing. When we needed something, the staff was very helpful. We'd definitely stay there again."
"The Whole Family Enjoyed it!!	My boys are half Chinese and the rest is Finnish. We specially chose this courtyard hotel so they could experence the Chinese culture. This is also a first China trip for my husband. He just loves this place and learned how to say the Courtyard (SihouYan) in Chinese. We have two rooms. Each room is decorated with ancient Chinese furnitures, Chinese style wall paper and etc. The room is sparkly clean. The courtyard is beautiful and painted with red, green bright color with ancient styled patterns. The breakfast was included in the price and you need to pre order it the day before. I am a Chinese, but never stayed in the courtyard hotel before. Remember, this type of the courtyard house only exsits in Beijing. The courtyard hotel is nested in the HuTong (Beijing Style Alley). To learn more about the HuTong, please visite the link to Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutong. There are Beijing people living in the HuToing and good restaurants and shops nearby. The staff was warm and friendly and helpful. My husband had a haircut across the street for $5. It was kind of fun. This was truly a wonderful experience for the whole family. Sep 24 2021 	nice courtyard hotel	This coutyard is small but very beautiful. the staff here are very helpful.The highlight is the room.Traditional style and relaxed atomosphere are all amazing.All is perfect. Sep 22 2021 	Wonderful and unique experience great friendly staff Hidden Gem!	We had a wonderful time staying in this very charming hotel with traditional Chinese style decoration. The room is clean and comfortable, the staff is friendly and location is close to local attractions. Very unique experience compare to living in a regular 4 star hotel. We love it. If you like to experience the traditional Chinese culture and Beijing &quot;Hu Tong&quot; , it is the place to be. Sep 22 2021 	Our trip was great. We really enjoyed our stay!	Our trip was great. We really enjoyed our stay!Overall, its fun and authentic place to stay.Will definitely book St Chr again, if I ever come back to Beijing. Sep 21 2021 	Perfect hostel	First time in China and first time in Beijing, excited and good luck for me to live in a comfortable hostel. Brilliant location and friendly staffs. Full of fun with excellent price. Definitely the coming the choice when I am in Beijing next time. Sep 18 2021 	Traditional style provides unparallel experiences	The hotel provides me unique experiences with its Chinese traditional style rooms, the ranch is furnished with classic Chinese furniture, yet it is clean and service is great.Its location is great in central Beijing, commuting by public transportation is easy. The landscape with green yard, red wall makes me feel I am in a blend of contemporary and traditional Chinese cultures.Recommended! Sep 15 2021 	helpful staff and nice room	The staff was very helpful and spoke very good English. There was a good selection of American and Asian foods for breakfast, and you can order as much as you want for the next day. The highlight was the room. Very cultural, cozy, yet had all the modern amenities. The courtyard made for a very quiet rest. Sep 4 2021 	I like spring garden hotel	The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. The courtyard and rooms had a great ambience, and learning how to make dumplings was a highlight! After exploring Beijing, Spring Garden was a fantastic and relaxing place to return to each evening. Mar 18 2021 	Traditional-Peaceful ambiance distinctive beauty	While in the process of booking once again at the Beijing Spring Garden Courtyard Hotel I have some comments with regards to the last opinion I see expressed here. We stayed there also last year during December and while it was cold, we found that the only issue we had was that the heat control was only in Chinese. The front desk responded quickly and showed us how to use it. We all had a good laugh and were fine.We also found that the English spoken, while not native American, was certainly understandable. The staff was very attentive, yet subtle, and even offered us breakfast whenever we awoke ! You must remember that this hotel, even rated at 4 stars, is not comparable with today's modern 4 star facilities in that these buildings are over 800 years old. They have been magnificently restored to provide modern day comforts with disrupting as little as possible of the original living conditions. If you choose to stay there, you are staying to experience the ambiance and sereneness of many years past. You can still hear the sounds of ancient Chinese Hutong life. It is like going back in time.We feel that part of our stay was like being part of the Si He Yuan itself. We are hoping to stay at the Spring Garden II, which is in a more acitve part of the Beijing Hutongs. It is truely an incredible and worthwhile experience. If ancient China has an appeal to you then you really should try this hotel. Nov 17 2018 	Not Recommended for Non-Chinese Speakers or During Cold Weather!	This hotel might be ok for a summertime visit, but I arrived in November and it was completely inadequately heated. There was a heating unit attached to the ceiling but it didn't provide nearly enough heat - it was freezing. I ended up leaving and cancelling my stay because I couldn't stand the cold. Also, you can only make local calls from the phone in the room - you can't even use a phone card. I tried to use an IP card to make an international call and it doesn't work - you can only use phone cards at the front desk. Very inconvenient.If you don't speak Chinese I don't recommend staying here - I spoke Chinese so it wasn't a problem, but the staff hardly spoke English at all. Also, be prepared to walk - taxi cab drivers don't know where the place is, so if you don't speak Chinese you'll have a hard time explaining to them how to get there. The staff was very friendly, but it was just too cold there to be enjoyable. Jul 19 2018 	The best - loved the Spring Garden in Beijing	A friend recommended this delightful hotel for our stay in Beijing - and I am SO glad we took his advice. Yes, it is a little hard to find, but all the taxis we took when we were out and about found the location. (Once you're at the hotel, they supply you with a map and a card with directions to facilitate your outings. They can also arrange tours and cultural experiences, if you so desire.) Part of its charm is that it's away from the noise and hubub, down an alley, and yet reasonably close to the Forbidden City and Behai Gardens. (Reasonably close by Beijing standards since you still must take a taxi to get there.)The building itself is 800 years old and consists of 8 beautifully decorated guest rooms, all air-conditionned (of course), surrounding two courtyards. I felt as if had fallen through a crack in time. The staff was wonderful; they even prepared a birthday surprise - cake and red wine - for my husband. When it rained they offered us nice umbrellas (sturdy and large) and were available to help us whenever we needed it. Breakfast was yummy - we ate once in the dining room (which is lined with old photos of life in Beijing) and once in the courtyard. You may also eat in your room. You do order the night before - it's a small hotel and the service has an &quot;at home&quot; feel. During our China trip, we did stay at a couple of 5 star highrise hotels, but the Spring Garden gave us the best experience of them all. (We all - my husband and I are over 50 and my son and friend are 25-loved this place.) Jun 4 2018 	The Spring Garden Hotel - A taste of life in the Hutongs	We just left the spring garden hotel last week and had a wonderful experience there. This hotel is situated right in the middle of a hutong (for those who don't know, a hutong is basically an old world courtyard style house, one level &amp; usually with a garden in the middle). If you're looking for a highrise luxury hotel then this is NOT the place to go...the Sheraton is a few kilometers away. The room was very comfortable...i think we stayed in room 7. The total number of rooms there were under 10. The decor of the room is typical classic chinese style with a 4 post canopy bed and wooden furniture. The staff at the hotel are great. Unfortunately I never got their names but they were always more than willing to help us with absolutely anything we needed. When we wanted to go out for dinner and drinks, we showed them places we wanted to go to (or often they would suggest places themselves) and they would write it down on a little slip of paper in chinese for the cab drivers to understand. FYI - if you're going to beijing for the first time, communicating with cab drivers can be quite difficult. Breakfast comes with your room rate and is delicious and made to order. Keep in mind that you have to order the night before and they will have it ready for you whenever you wish. There is a Chinese breakfast (dumplings, pork buns, wantons, etc) and a Western breakfast (eggs, toast, coffee &amp; juice). Overall a wonderful experience and really nothing to complain about. Quick tip - there is a minimart at the end of the hutong on the main road. You can get anything there from little snacks to beers for very cheap. If you have any questions or need any info at all about my experience in Beijing feel free to contact me. Mar 26 2018 	A Taste of Old Beijing	I stayed only one night at the Spring Garden in Beijing last week when I was there for a 5-day visit. It was a lovely courtyard-style place with traditional decor, located in the hutong area (narrow lanes with low-rise old-style houses - really low) of Beijing with only 8 rooms. I especially loved the evening view of the courtyard when the street lamps cast a hue over the hotel, giving it a charming and romantic look.It certainly was not easy to locate and all three cabdrivers whose cabs I took had some difficulty finding it. It is best to have the hotel name and address pre-written in Chinese on a note to show the driver. For those who prefer hotels with star-ratings and full modern facilities, you should give this a miss. However, for those who are keen on experiencing the old and traditional, this would be a good choice. The place was very clean, and the bed, though hard, was surprisingly comfortable and gave me a very good night's rest (actually, I'd love to get that for my home!). The receptionists (Ziyi and another girl I didn't get the name of) I met there were friendly and eager to offer assistance. Although their command of English was a bit limited, it was not difficult to communicate with them. Breakfast was simple fare, but specially cooked for you according to your preferred timing and selected choice from their menu. I took the receptionist's recommendation of the wonton soup, which was excellent!I would suggest anyone planning to stay here to check out the hotel's photos on the internet or even the hotel's own website before coming. I was quite aware of what to expect before I arrived and the fact that it was smaller than I expected only added to its charm and did not mar the pleasant stay I had there. However, I heard from the receptionist that they had a small group of people from Spain who booked 2 rooms for 5 nights, who arrived, and claimed they did not like what they saw. They left immediately but was pretty annoyed the hotel charged them for one night's stay although they should have also considered that the hotel might have turned away other guests due to their reservations and for a hotel this small, that would have been quite a substantial loss. Mar 2 2018 	Lovely quirky friendly and helpful	We stayed at the Spring Garden Courtyard Hotel in January 2018. The hotel is just lovely - it's in a hutong (a traditional Beijing street), very near Tiananmen Square, and is based - as the name would suggest - around a central courtyard. There are only 8 rooms, each beautifully decorated and fitted to a very high standard.The staff were extremely helpful, particularly when we had to spend quite a lot of time unexpectedly rescheduling trains and flights.Breakfast was good and varied, including the option of interesting Chinese dumplings and buns. The hotel also provides a free internet room, which is a big bonus.The best thing about staying in such a small hotel is that it's a very personal experience. We felt like honoured guests for our entire stay.One piece of advice: avoid room 6, which appeared to have some problems with the plumbing, resulting in a slight smell in the bathroom. Sep 25 2007 	Spring Garden - a tranquil jewel	We booked a 'deluxe' double room @ 720 yuan at the Spring Garden in early April 07 through travelinchinaguide.com, so were thrilled to see such a great review by all4travelling on 1 May, whose comments we fully confirm. Spring Garden was an absolute jewel and we delighted in our marvellous ‘find’ many times every day!We were in Room #1 (or 8001, as the Spring Garden has just eight rooms, all with the prefix 800) with its own undercover porch outside our door, facing the tranquil small courtyard with its gentle small waterfall over rocks, our possie made more private by a gorgeous fruiting pomegranate tree. There are four rooms on this front courtyard, and four in a rear courtyard (which is not as charming as the front). Rooms #1 and #2 are the top pick.Our room was spotless, with bright Chinese decorations and artifacts, and a huge emperor-sized double bed. When we first tested it, it felt very firm to well, hard; but proved surprisingly comfortable, we slept like babes and began to wonder if our bed at home was actually too soft!The staff were so friendly, accommodating and so generous with their time with any requests, lovely young girls who’s English is improving every day – and on the third day, and young man who was equally friendly and helpful. We spent lots of relaxing hours on our courtyard patio – such tranquil bliss, so peaceful – and in the evening, with our sundowners, softly piped Chinese music to accompany the soft glow of the red lanterns . Magic!As an indication of the level of service – early one morning, we asked reception to call us a taxi. As the response by telephone was deemed too slow, one of the girls changed from her red cheongsam into street clothes, raced to the nearest cross-road, hailed a cab, directed him to the hotel, then puffing ... announced its arrival.We did have a small hiccough with the plumbing drainage (as does a large slice of Beijing) – not with the shower, but with the toilet – but this was fixed immediately using the universally-known ‘black plunger’. Breakfast was included – the western version consisting of ham, egg and toast, and the Chinese version a brown barley soup and steamed dumplings (yum), juice and coffee (loved the kiwi - or Chinese gooseberry - juice). But there was no variation of the brekkie theme, and by the sixth day DH was hangin’ out for some good old cornflakes! ;)We enjoyed our small laneway, Xise Bei 6 Tiao or Nanwei hutong, and strolled its length many times, becoming familiar with the residents who nodded and smiled in recognition – especially the dog walkers with their itty bitty Pekingese – so that we felt a small part of their community.A true gem, stuff that fond memories are made of. May 1 2007 	A small quiet hotel in the heart of Beijing	We stayed at the Spring Garden Hotel for 5 nights in April 2007 and had a wonderful time. It is a traditional &quot;Si He Yuan&quot; with 8 rooms located in a hutong. Since it is outside of the standard tourist district, we felt like we got to experience real life in Beijing. The photos on the hotel's website provide a fair representation of the hotel. The staff is wonderful and speaks adequate English. They were extremely helpful with making sight-seeing arrangements. They also hailed a taxi for us when we left for the airport. They even made sure that we had extra bottles of water to take with us on our day trip to the Great Wall. The rooms are located on a single level around 2 separate courtyards and were clean and nicely furnished with antique reproductions. They are also extraordinarily quiet. The beds contain traditional Chinese mattresses and might be considered hard by some. The bathrooms were new and modern and came with the standard amenities (toothbrush, comb, etc.). During our stay, one of the showers began to leak and it was fixed immediately upon request. There were televisions and air-conditioners in each room. Breakfast was included in the price of our room and was served either downstairs in a breakfast area or in the courtyard. They were also willing to pack a picnic breakfast if needed. The choice for breakfast was either &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; and included as much as you wanted. Dumplings were served in the early evening upon request. Bottled water was included with the room, but other drinks were available for a small fee. A karioke machine was also available for use by guests in the downstairs breakfast area. The location is very central, near many shops and restaurants. A Bank of China with a cash machine is located within a 1/2 block from the hotel (on Xi Shi Street). It is an easy walk to BeiHai Park with its market, restaurants and natural beauty. The # 22 bus runs down Xi Shi Street, through the Xi Dan shopping area and then to Tiananmen Square. Another bus stops about a block away goes to the zoo/aquarium. It is also about a 15 minute walk to the subway (or an easy transfer from the bus to the subway at Xi Dan). Taxis are also easily hailed on Xi Shi street. The 7 year old who was traveling with us wants you to know that the Spring Garden was the best hotel that she stayed at during her entire 2 week trip to China. The adults on the trip concur.

"Nov 8 2021 	Absolutly Charming	What a place! If you want a luxury hotel go ahead, but if you want to mix with the locals and find out what great people they are this is a good start. I was traveling with a friend, and we cannot think of anything to complain about. We stayed here twice… once at arrival and once after our trip to Inner Mongolia. Bobby (owner), his wife, and the girls who work there are so friendly and eager to help that when we left we felt like they were family.There is complementary tea anytime, dumpling day on Tuesday (you are more than welcome to help if you wish). One night we had dinner with Bobby, his wife, and the girls that work there, and so on and so on… We asked for help on getting train tickets to Zhangjiakou and the next day we had the tickets on our hands without moving a finger.The staff, Yan Xiao, and Graciella even took me shopping on their day off and made my life much easier when dealing with merchants. That is what I call customer service at its best.This is the best accommodation I have ever had including those in luxury hotels (which I am not fond of) in my life. Authentic wonderful Chinese people and culture! Oct 26 2021 	Wonderful place	Very nice and clean rooms. The yard in this old hutong house has been covered with a glass roof - that gives You an opportunity to use the yard as a cosy lobby/living room.The staff - young girls - are very helpful. The hotel manager Bob lived in Australia for some years and speak fluently english. Bob and his wife are very considerate, kind and the make great efford in making the guests have a good time in Beijing. Oct 1 2021 	If you want to actually ""experience"" Beijing	You can go to Beijing, stay in a western style hotel, and say you have been to Beijing. Or you can stay at a hotel such as the Templeside Deluxe Hutong House and say you have experienced Beijing.This is because as the name suggests the hotel is in a hutong and from the moment you step out the door you are in an authentic, everyday Beijing setting with local people going about their normal day to day life.The hotel itself is an old family home which has seven guest rooms set around a central courtyard. The rooms are a good size and have everything you need to have a comfortable stay while the courtyard doubles as the eating area and a place to meet fellow travellers. We found everything about the hotel to be clean and well presented.Bobby the owner speaks excellent English and one of his younger staff members who is always there when he is not also speaks good English. The rest of the staff have minimal English but they know their job well enough to ensure that everything runs smoothly. The food, whether it is the breakfast prepared at the hotel or other meals ordered from a nearby restaurant, is very good and very cheap.The day we left we caught the night train to Xian but even though we had checked out of our room in the morning the hotel minded our luggage for the day and allowed us to have a shower before we left to catch the train.The nearest subway station is an easy 10-15 minute walk and taxis are easy to get by walking 2 minutes to the nearest main road. Each morning we walked to the subway by heading west through the hutong knowing that we would eventually come to the main road where the station is. We were always the only non-Chinese around. At night though we would use the main roads to ensure we found the right alley way to get to the hotel and not get lost.A tip that may be handy. We found getting taxis to the hotel difficult even though we had the name and address written in Chinese. Drivers either don't know where it is or are reluctant to drive into a hutong as it can take them so long to get back out. It is best to get hotel staff to write the nearest main intersection to give to the taxi driver and walk the two or three minutes to the hotel from there.The sights of Beijing are spread all over the city so no one hotel is going to be central to them all. With this in mind do yourself a favour and pick a hotel with a difference and actually experience the life of the city. You probably won't be here again so make the most of your stay and take home some true memories. Aug 22 2021 	Awesome. Bobby and company were amazing helpful nice...wonderful.	Templeside is a wonderful place. It's not right in the center of things, but I consider that a good thing when I beijing, at least. The hutong is charming, and not at all touristy, which means you can get wonderful prices on things like white peaches and Beijing duck. The place itself has covered the center courtyard, making a great space to hang out, eat, read, relax. They have an AC in there and provide cool books like the China lonely planet guide. They don´t have a restaurant in the place (though they wil make you breakfast in the kitchen), but are happy to order out for you. The food gets delivered within about a half an hour and is hot and wonderful. Bobby, the owner, speaks English exceptionally well, is VERY helpful, and they have a book full of helpful info...menus, subway maps, you can even book trips to the great wall or to Chinese acrobatic shows. Theyhave a DVD library, internet that's relatively inexpensive, and Bobby and his staff are also happy to translate directions for you. Make sure you have them do that, as NONE of the cab drivers speak any English (or anything other than Mandarin), and you won't be able to communicate otherwise. I highly reccommend Templeside Delux, as well as their other locations, which I saw and were nice. The hotel as well as the shared accommodations are just lovely. And it's a nice place to come home to after the steamy summer bustle of Beijing. Also, surrounding are some very nice tea shops, and it's only a few (albeit long) blocks from the subway stop (though cab fare is cheap, so you can pretty much get anywhere for under $5 U.S.). Jul 15 2021 	Great Ho(s)tel	Bobbie's Templeside Deluxe Ho(s)tel was great. It's located right in the Hutongs close to Fuchengmen subway station (about 15 min walk). The looks of the courtyard and the rooms are amazing - all colorful and lovely. The rooms were clean, and well-equipped. the staff is very very friendly and helpful. They offer dumpling-making sessions once a week, which is great fun and have advise on where to go and what to do and on local stuff such as different markets (fruit, antiques, food ect) . Internet with reasonable speed is also available ALWAYS WORTH A VISIT. Jun 21 2021 	Great authentic place to stay in Beijing	The hotel is a an excellent place to stay where one can enjoy a memorable stay in the capital and have the opportunity to be within the everyday life of a typical neighbourhood in Beijing.The rooms are clean and have all the facilities one can desire including airconditioning, TV and a good internet connection.The location is very central with good transport connections to all the tourist attractions as well as the shopping centers.The best part is surely the friendly team at the hotal, which is always ready to advise how and in what way one can go about visiting places of interest. May 3 2021 	two week jog thru China	Templeside was an excellent place to stay, if you like, as we do, staying in a real residential neighborhood. It's in the middle of a hatong, traditional Beijing neighborhoods which are rapidly disappearing. The room and the common areas were very comfortable, and Bobby, the proprietor, speaks excellent English and was very helpful. Templeside was the nicest place we stayed in China, all of which were fine. Jun 3 2021 	Sympatisches Gästehaus in authentischer Umgebung"
"Jul 20 2021 	Exceptional and exceeded expectations (which are already very high for Aman)	This is an amazing property. It has all of the expected qualities of an Aman resort:- incredible design- exceptional service- feel-at-home atmosphere- incorporation of local culture into all elements of the property- luxurious amenities / facilitiesThis, like other Aman properties, is a place to go so that you can feel human again!In addition, this property is unique because of its historical significance and access to the Summer Palace. During our stay, we were treated to a semi-private performance of the Beijing Opera inside the Summer Palace grounds (with drinks catered by Aman). Though this does not appear to be a regular occurrence, it is indicative of the access that the Aman has and close relationship between the property and the Summer Palace.The only criticisms I have of the property are 1) the Chinese-style chairs used throughout can be a bit uncomfortable -- i.e., not as &quot;loungey&quot; as other Aman properties (though staff are quick to add a pillow to help out) 2) no natural light at the swimming pool (though it is still quite lovely).This is a must-see property and experience. It certainly isn't inexpensive but the experience is worth the cost. You will feel as if you are living like the Empress Dowager herself (but with the benefit of modern ammenities -- plasma screens, a private movie theater, spa facilities, etc.).My only other recommendation would be that you focus your visit on the property and the Summer Palace (minimum of 2 nights) instead of using the property as a base for exploring the city. The property is relatively far from the city which makes it hard to step out and see the sites. I'd suggest a few nights in the city (Peninsula is my pick) and then a few nights out at the Aman. Thumbs up on another great addition to the Aman portfolio! Apr 14 2021	A beautiful historical Aman...	Aman in Beijing, it's staying in a beautiful historical residence, a spiritual experience cause you'll feel to be the last emperor of China. Set at the gate of the well known Summer Palace, this is the first Aman in a city but actually, it takes more than 45 minutes to join the lively heart of Beijing and this is something a bit annoying because when we stay in a city, it's more to be in the epicenter of the vibrant life than to be in a very secluded place...However, if it's not a problem for you, The Aman at Summer Palace is a very beautiful property with a fabulous design and with a private access to one of the most important site of Beijing. There is a lot of peace in this place and you'll have the nice impression to be at home far away from your home. The suites are spacious, elegant, very comfy and you'll recognize easily all the details of Aman... The only difference is a TV which is something new for this fabulous hotel brand but i think this is not essential in this kind of place... Just looking your courtyard from your suite, listening the chinese music close to the pond, reading a book in the massive library or going in the best fitness and beauty center i've seen around the world (amazing pool, first class spa, state of the art fitness studio...) will be much better than staying in front of a screen... But actually, there is a private cinema as well and i have to tell you it's a great time to choose your movie and ask to make this somptuous theatre private, just for you... An experience not to be missed...So, this new Aman could have five points easily but the staff needs a bit more training to provide the unique Aman touch to the guests. The chinese culture is quite strong and this country is not yet adaptated to this kind of resort. I'm very sure the adorable GM, Mark Swinton, will know how to do to make the staff more friendly very soon and some of the staff are already just perfect...Aman in Beijing is great but personnaly, i don't like the location and i think the staff needs a bit more training but this is a fabulous resort with the finest decoration... Highly recommanded. Nov 16 2018 	Perfect Oasis in the Best Location in Beijing	We spent one night in a deluxe suite (we were upgraded on arrival by Mark, the hotel manager) in early November. The entire experience was fabulous! Our suite was glorious, with an ante-room connecting it to the suite in which our friends were staying, a very large living room, a beautiful master bedroom and a nicely appointed en-suite bathroom (with the best bathrobes I have ever encountered anywhere). The property is laid out in a series of attractive, serene, interconnecting courtyards, and incorporates a number of buildings that were guest houses for visitors to the Summer Palace in Qing dynasty times. The hotel has a private entrance into the grounds of the Summer Palace, our visit to which was the highlight of our stay. Hendry at the front desk was very helpful in organising an itinerary, driver and guide for our foray into town to see Tienanmen Square, the Forbidden City and a hutong. We only ate one meal at the hotel. The four of us ordered a room service lunch from the Chinese menu on the day we checked out, which was served to us in the ante-room between the two suites; it arrived in 25 minutes and was absolutely superb. Good wine list, too.Very minor quibbles: it would be good to have a library of DVDs for guests (there were only 2 when we were there, one of them fortunately being The Last Emperor); and the mattresses are on the firm side, so it might be good to have a pillow-top option for guests who prefer a softer mattress. Oct 12 2018 	Lives up to expectations	As I checked out of the almost brand new Ritz Carlton Financial Street hotel in Beijing and asked the cab driver to drive me to the Aman, first of all he (and the Ritz staff) had no idea what an Aman hotel is, and then he asked why I would want to go there, coz surely it cannot be a nicer/better hotel so I spent the next 10-15 minutes in the car explaining the Aman hotels/concept, even though prior to BJ, I have only been to two other AmansI loved the Aman Summer Palace, though only some of the buildings were from the Qing era, still the complete feeling of escape into a different era and that you are in old China is not a feeling one would get in a nice boring brand new corporate modern hotel where the rooms pretty much look the same all over the worldthe Aman experience also cannot be described in pictures (although I did manage to take 30 photos of the hotel &amp; its grounds) because it really is the service/the quality staff that gives the Aman brand such a well deserved loyal following, not something to take for granted especially in Beijing where there are lots of nice hotels (the hardware is there) but inexperienced staff (the staff are not just well trained, they have really perfected the skill of being helpful/friendly without being intrusive.service aside though, you feel more like a guest in a super wealthy family friend's home than in a hotel (or a movie set), the rooms/facilities (spa &amp; restaurant) were all very good, the landscaping nice, did I mention there's a private entrance into the summer palace as well. Jul 24 2021 	????AMAN"
"Nov 21 2021 	A huge disappointment... Very noisy incompetent staff.	Beware: in this hotel, you cannot sleep after 7:30 am, and this lasts till the late afternoon). They are renovating the upper floors (and should probably renovate the lower floors as well), so that you the noise of machines will inevitably wake you up (unfortunately no later than 7:30 am). Moreover, the walls of the rooms are very thin, and the isolation of the windows not so good, so that you cannot hope for going to bed too early (especially if you have loudy Chinese staying next to you). The rooms look good at first sight, but if you stay more than 1 night, you'll start noticing bad things (as some hair in bathroom that do not belong to you, nail on the floor that should not be there...). And the management of the hotel is very poor: As i complained about the noise (and the fact that you cannot stay in the room for the whole day owing to the noise of construction machines), the manager only offered us two bananas and one apple. After insisting a lot, he finally agreed to give us one complementary breakfest... but only for one of us! The other wuold have to pay... I found it very unprofessional as we are a youg married couple staying in the hotel 3 nights, and both of us were annoyed by the noise during the night and in the early morning. So, if you stay 1 night and have to catch up your plane early in the morning, the hotel is fine. But it is false and deceiving to believe that The Emperor Hotel is a luxuary (or even nice) hotel that you'll enjoy staying at.... Nov 13 2021 	A different opinion	I booked this hotel because of the rave reviews and also because it is under the SLH (Small Luxury Hotel) brand. It is classified as a 'designer', 'boutique' hotel but I found that contrary to popular opinions, the required elements are lacking. While it is difficult to argue about taste, I would just present the negative facts here:- The hotel is located in a rundown alley with not even one decent house. There is a hospital next door. Walking to/from hotel at night time is not recommended.- The hotel is about 20 min walk from Wangfujeng, and about 20 min walk from subway.- The room decoration can be classified as Ikea quality, though there are some design elements.- The mattress is of poor quality.- Washroom is small (the one I stayed in) with no bathtub.- Room size is less than 200sqft, not the claimed 300.I paid about $100/night for the room but there are better choices during the same period. Oct 31 2021 	Great location great staff great bar	The Emperor was a fun, modern hotel with an amazing location - during a four day stay I could walk to most of the places I wanted to visit and was a short trip to the subway for anything else. The hotel is metres from the wall of the Forbidden City along a small, quiet road.The room was clean and large and full of nice touches - rainforest shower, free minibar, free wireless and a free chinese stamp. Breakfast had a good selection of western and Chinese food.The roof bar is fantastic with great views over Beijing - only problem was that it was very quiet whilst I was visiting (although October is maybe not ideal roof bar weather).Service was good - and best of all they let me check into my room when I arrived at six in the morning. They even offered me an extra breakfast for that morning.Only downside was that taxi drivers didn't know where the hotel was even with a card in chinese with a map on it. I had a few taxi drivers refuse to take me, but it never took long to find one that would. Oct 5 2021 	Great location and Great Service	Our original hotel - cancelled on us 12 hours before we arrived in Beijing due to an electrical problem. They gave us two options - we chose The Emperor Hotel. What a great choice. They picked us up at the airport, organized a car to drive us to the Great Wall, where they made reservations at a fabulous place for us to eat lunch (The School House), provided bikes the next day to ride around Beijing, recommeded another great restuarant in Beijing. We asked them to confirm our plane reservations only to learn that the flight had been cancelled. The staff quickly got us on another flight out of Beijing. This was very helpful considering that we did not speak the lauguage. The hotel was clean and the location was fabulous - you could walk everywhere. Can't say enough about how great the staff was! Oct 4 2021 	loved it!	It really was a fun room. You could watch tv or listen to the TV while in the shower! not that this is an important part of hotel rooms, but its an example of the coolness of the room. Hotel staff were nice and helpful. lots of freebies in the room. The location was maybe a 15- 20 minute walk from the metro, but you can get around really cheap with cabs. Rooftop restaurant has a view of the forbidden city and surrounding buildings--but don't expect too much as forbidden city is not lit at night, and the pollution is dense. About 25 minute walk to the entrance of Forbidden city. It has a more neighborhood feel than a tourist district--quite streets. Sep 4 2021 	One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at	This hotel doesnt look much from the outside, but the inside is fantastic.If you love staying at little quirky boutique style hotels, then I am sure you will not be disappointed.The rooms are really modern and the one of the most interestingly designed of any hotel I have stayed in. The are not overly large, but you have everything you need. There is a desk, a sitting area, and the bathroom was really gorgeous.The in room minibar is complementary so you dont have to justify an overpriced minibar glass of wine before you go out at night because its free! Little things like this really make the difference, as well as the little plate of goodies they bring at turndown.The upstairs roofbar is a great place to be for sunset you can see right over the forbidden city. You are also within walking distance of both Hot Pot and Beijing duck eating places, that the hotel staff recommended to us.Taxis are plentiful on the main road that runs along the side of the hotel, you can hail one fairly easily yourself or the staff are pretty happy to do this for you, we found the staff to be very good here, and they always seemed to be cheerful!The breakfast was tasty. We stayed here for 4 nights and for 3 mornings when the hotel was quieter we got an a la carte breakfast, this was much better than the buffet we got on the last morning (Saturday), but it was still good.Also, check out the DragonFly spa a few roads down, their treatments, (especially the foot massage after a day in the Forbidden City) were excellent value and it is a really nice place.Very much recommend, the hotel and Beijing are both wonderful. Aug 31 2021 	funkymodern and homey feeling.	This hotel is great and just unbelievable. When you check in the hotel, you have everything your need in terms of amenities and service. the hotel design is modern, elegant and nice in all aspect. Staff are very friendly and well English speaker. I just stayed there two weeks agoI am a vegetarian and i really did not like the breakfast as the receptionist informed me that the breakfast is American but it was not but for meat eater, it would be nice.I will defiantly stay in the Hotel as it is comfortable, nice, close to attraction. highly recommended. Aug 21 2021 	Great Design Service so so	Arrived at this hotel with great expectations and the design certainly did not disappoint but I was none too impressed when they did not have a record of my reservation. I had booked through the &quot;Design Hotels&quot; web site, a world wide group this hotel belongs to. Thankfully rooms were available. My other grip was the room was not made up until at 3.30pm I had to ring and ask for it to be serviced. Two small grips but they should not have happened. I was also advised by &quot;Design Hotels&quot; that The Emperor would be in touch with me via email about these issues - I am still waiting!But be that as it may it is a fun hotel in a great location. All rooms are named after Chinese Emperors and decorated in modern style with faces of the Emperors in bright pastel colors. There is a free mini bar in the room which is a great touch and the all inclusive breakfast is excellent. It would be nice to have a few more English channel choices on the TV not that we want to spend out time watching TV in the room all day. But a movie channel would have been nice.The hotel is in a great location close to the Forbidden City and in walking distance to the &quot;back door &quot;of the Forbidden City and in walking distance to the hutong area around the lakes (about a 20 - 30 minute walk). The hotel is located in a narrow lane in an old part of Beijing (taxi drivers sometimes have difficulty finding it so take a map and the address in Chinese) and the views of the Forbidden City 's roof tops from the terrace of the hotel is superb.I would stay here again and hope next time that they have my reservation and that the overall service standards improve. Jun 15 2021 	Fantastic Hotel	We stayed four days at the Emperor and truly enjoyed our stay. The hotel has a beautiful design and nice spacious rooms. In particular the service at the Emperor was impeccable. The staff went out of their way to service us. Only a minute would pass after we entered the hotel before we were offered hot tea, and cookies would be placed in our room when we came back from a long day of sightseeing. The hotel is located next to the Forbidden City and many of Beijing’s historic attractions is thus within walking distance. We strongly recommend this hotel. Jun 9 2021 	Modern 	Booked with Expedia, stayed 4 nights last week in May at The Emperor. It is relatively new with a modern minimalistic and funky look. The hotel is walking distance to tourist sights, shopping malls, restaurants, super markets and night markets. Situated in a quiet area amongst the local hutongs. The double bed is very firm as with all beds in China, but great soft pillows. The large showerhead with strong pressure was great. There is also a handheld shower but no bath. Showering with sound &amp; view to the whole room &amp; suspended TV was awesome. Comp bathrobes, slippers, minibar, kettle for tea &amp; coffee and plates of cookies to finish the day. TV has english programs not just news and free wifi internet. Rate included western breakfast of fresh fruits, pastries, choice of omelette, fried or scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, toast. Rooftop bar and gym on the 4th floor has views of Tiananmen Square and Forbidden Palace - we were fortunate to see the night lights due to the Dragon Boat Festival. Most of the young staff spoke english, friendly, helpful and efficient. The only hitch was finding taxis that can get us back to hotel. Be sure to get the hotel address in chinese and in large print. Hotel card is hard to read particularly at night. We would definitely go back there. Mar 1 2021 	Quick Sight seeing trip to Beijing	Things in China are not always as they “appear” and there was a bit or risk going with a hotel chain I am not familiar with. The Emperor Hotel was definitely forth it. I booked through Expedia and at the last minute decided to go with the Emperor Hotel based on location and that most of the reviews were very good. It is exactly as you see in the pictures very hip and cool. The location is IDEAL fir a short stay in Beijing. It is literally one row of houses from the Forbidden City. The staff was great! They were able to give me a cash advance on my CC when my ATM card stopped working. (This was very stressful as I was trying to pay for a guided tour that I had been on all day and came up short when it was time to pay.)There is no shuttle service from the Airport but I printed out the address in Chinese from somewhere on the internet and the taxi got me there for 100RMB. Andrew OttSeattle WA. / Hong Kong SAR Jan 13 2021	A Fantastic Experience	My wife and son and I went their for three days just before New Years '09 (Judea-Christian). Yes, a unique experience. The staff could not do enough. It is right next door to the Forbidden City and walking distance to the Night Market. My son became ill from something (airplane food), but was okay. The hotel folks were great. The dinner voucher was cool-very upscale cuisine included. The breakfast was perfectly Western. For a break-go to Grandma's Kitchen down the street for hamburger or chicken and French fries.Oh, and the decor of the hotel and the room was very cool. Thanks Emperor. Nov 16 2008 	Emperor = Unique hotel great location! (travel agent review)	I spent 4 nights at the boutique Emperor Hotel in Beijing and I must say it was one of the most unique hotels I have ever stayed in.Its a member of the Design Hotels of Germany with modern and funky architecture but still paying homage to Chinese history.Instead of room numbers, you stay in a room named after an Emperor. My room was on the third floor (the halls smell pretty) and it was called Wu Ze Tian, named after the only female Emperor so I was pretty pleased with that . :)The room is spacious enough for one, even two, but not meant for roommates you may not know well. The bathroom is open concept so you can see the rest of your room as you shower.Since the gadgets are funky and in a modern design, it will take you a few minutes to get your bearings as to how things work and where to find it.One of my favorite things was their turn-down service. When you walk in, music is playing, the lights are dimmed, and there is a plate of cookies waiting for you.The mini-bar selection is good, but the fridge is warm so be warned. Their breakfast buffet was absolutely delicious with many Western choices, and I loved the omelet station!We had one dinner there which was a 10 course feast with amazing food presentations - very unique. Some of the food was hit or miss but that was most of my food experiences in China.The mattress is a bit hard but that worked well for my back apparently!The service at the hotel is impeccable. There is always one or two people in their laid-back lobby waiting to help you in any way when you return.The location is fantastic. It is close to the Forbidden City, but tucked away in a alley street amongst the locals (which I liked) and many cabs won't know where it is all the time as it is still brand new so always have the address handy.Overall, I was completely impressed with this hotel and it needs to be seen to really understand it. I would recommend it to anyone! Thanks! May 19 2008 	Great location great hotel	I booked my stay at the hotel via the designhotels.com site, as I was looking for something more personable and on a smaller scale. Situated in a quiet (!) location next to the Forbidden City, it proved to be a great starting point to visit town or the nearby major sites - on foot.As to the hotel itself: The (English-speaking) staff has been extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel roof bar offers excellent views and the hotel's design elements are consistent, even if not all design is always the most practical. Also food in the hotel restaurant was surpisingly good, considering the size of the hotel. Since The Emperor only opened recently, I found myself to be one of the few visitors, but perhaps for this reason I was lucky enough to enjoy one of the hotel's opening offers. In any case, at the risk of sounding biased, I would readily recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Beijing. Myself, I am planning to return in November. Mar 30 2008 	Great design	I had a great surprise. A new, brand new Design Hotels(TM) member in CHina!! Great view from the rooftop tough! May 16 2021 	Déception... Pas fait pour durer... Oct 27 2008	diseño fantastico"
"Nov 19 2021 	Sunworld Dynasty Hotel - Better than expected	At the last minute, we booked Sunworld Dynasty hotel through the Agoda website. We stayed for five nights and the service we received is on par with standards of a five star foreign-own hotels (e.g. Sheraton). Most staff could communicate in English, which was helpful. (Not a lot of locals in the city can speak/understand English so it was nice to be able to speak our first language at the end of the day). Complimentary bottles of water were provided every day. We had a fair size room with a king bed. Bathroom was also a nice size with a shower and a bathtub. Turn down service was a nice touch. Note that there is only one non-smoking floor. Gym and pool facilities were also very good. Oct 29 2021 	Crappy hotel	It is now known as the Sunworld Dynasty Hotel. rated itself as 5 stars, more like 2 stars in fact.The toilet broke down in our first room and when we moved to another room, the toilet broke down again twice. By that stage, we were tired of moving so stayed put. Finally figured out that one is not supposed to dump toilet paper in the bowl. After wiping, throw it in the wastepaper basket beside the toilet bowl. I know it sounds gross but it worked.I think they have a major sewage problem in the hotel cos we saw the workmen working on the toilet in another room.Also, the ac does not work. It is always warm at 23 degrees.Go back there again,NO WAY! Oct 21 2021 	Ok but in need in renovation	10 years ago I stayed in this hotel for my first business trip to Beijing. It still has this impressive central hall. Apart from that, since then there has been no renovation and the management quality has detriorated. The breakfast budget still has some nice spots but also quite some room for improvement (running out of some items very early, dangerous looking sushi). Room service, even on the weekends, comes only around 3pm. Bathrooms seem to be partially redone. But still have floor standing toilets, not wall hung toilets like modern hotels have, therefore still unclean and dirty looking. Overall hotel is ok but could do better. Jan 17 2021 	High Quality Stay at Tianlun Dynasty	Tianlun Dynasty was a great hotel with good location within walking distance to Hutongs, Tianmen Square or Wangfujing shopping street. Room was really clean, nice and spacy. Hotel had good facilities, such as massage, swimming pool and bar. Also, the breakfest buffet was excellent! Oct 16 2017	Enjoyed our stay	Nice hotel with clean room, comfy king bed, our rate did not include breakfast. We ate Chinese breakfast at the restaurants down the street from hotel. Hotel has a lovely atrium with buffet-style restaurant. We found the concierge and travel desk to be extremely helpful (we bought plane tickets and acrobat tickets through travel desk). Not everyone on the staff spoke English, but there was usually someone at the desk that did. Would recommend. FYI, at the time we visited, May 2017, there was major work being done on Wangfujing Ave in preparation for the 2018 Olympics. If construction is still going on, do not accept a room that overlooks Wangfujing Ave or the Church because you will hear jackhammers. Sep 10 2017 	Great Value for your money	My husband and i had the pleasure of staying at Tianlun Dynasty Hotel in June as a stop over during our around the world tour this summer. Last year I went to Beijing and stayed at the Crown Plaza. While the room and service was decent, I elected to go with a hotel that was a bit more inexpensive but still in same area. Having read positive reviews for Tianlun Dynasty and saw it was in same area, I decided to go with it and was not disappointed. More than a few reviewers of this hotel mention the rooms facing the atrium and their annoyance at the music from piano in atrium lobby. Its worth noting that the Tianlun and Crown Plaza both had pianos in their atrium lobbies, which came alive during dinner. They had either a singer entertaining the dinner crowd or just music playing but at both hotels, music was over at a decent time to be able to sleep comfortably overnight. I understand the lure of western style Crown Plaza , however I dont think that the asian influenced style and service of Tianlun Dynasty should be a deterrent. If they refer to themselves as a 4 star hotel its because the rooms are clean, nicely sized, sufficient toiletries, prompt housekeeping services, fitness center and in room internet access. Yes the style is dated but i think thats part of the charm. as far as it being a smoking hotel--China is a smoking country. heck, the pollution in China overall is no secret and known worldwide--you can literally see the haze. as far as finding people who speak english in China in general is a task in itself. but still, when you travel, you manage to exchange information somehow and it helps to learn a few words in their language instead of us always expecting others around the world to speak our language. If you want boutique, chic trendy hotel, then dont stay here. Stay here if you want a hotel in a great location, within walking distance of Forbidden City, night market, shopping center and great value for your money. Furthermore, they have a killer lunch buffet. Here's where Tianlun beats Crown Plaza. The buffet has everything from grilled meats, all sorts of veggies, any fresh fruit and juices, even haggen daz ice cream. you can even have Peking duck everyday and its great--by the way the Quanjude Duck restaurant was way over-rated. Im from NY and Peking duck here is way better on any corner in chinatown. but i digress, i highly recommend this lovely hotel. also..if anyone is interested in using a private , patience and very personable driver who speaks decent english, feel free to contact me. we used him last year and again this time around. both times, he was always very professional and kind. great experience in china overall. Jul 23 2017	Would opt to stay in familiar Western chain hotel next time	Stayed with large group at this hotel. Pros: *The location is terrific...near the night market and busy shopping district. Can walk everywhere. Felt safe in small groups or alone. *The huge internal atrium area where there is music, dining, bar area. Great place to sit, have a pot of green tea or a cocktail, connect to the internet and plan the next days event. *The desk agent on the executive lounge floor was very helpful (language a bit of a barrier) in translation English to Mandarin for taxi cards. Cons:*It is a smoking hotel and I had a hard time breathing and had a sore throat for several days. I had to open the windows to air out the room but my room was on the outside overlooking the church next door so noise and air pollution was a constant.*Poor English/communication from staff...from the front desk to the restaurants, it was impossible to communicate if you do not know minimal Mandarin. They were not able to give anyone a non-smoking room and did not appear eager to help resolve the complaints from non-smokers. *Rooms were dated and could have used a good cleaning. *There seemed to be some questionable activities going on with the karaoke bars and lounges which we learned were not run/managed by the hotel but rather third party. It gave the hotel a bit of a questionable atmosphere. Jul 3 2017	Four stars is a joke	This is definitely not a four-star facility by any definition. Rooms were small and fixtures and furniture dated. Lobby layout and materials were old and sagging. Staff in general were fine though service and attitude were distinctly inferior to Hong Kong. Location is good. This problem of overrating hotels is endemic in the PRC. The only hotels that reasonably correspond to their ratings are those that are of western origin. I most likely will not stay here again. May 12 2017 	Excellent hotel but don't organise trips through hotel	Stayed in Tianlun Dynasty for a week. First few days stayed in a standard room and then stayed in deluxe for last two days. Both room types were excellent. Although got better view in deluxe, there wasn't much in it. Bathroom was slightly nicer and decor of room was bit more polished. Hotel staff were very pleasant but didn't their English was not as good as I was expecting.If you do stay, don't forget to bring a laptop since you get free internet access in room. We didn't so used business centre downstairs for 20yuan for 10 minutes after the first 10 free minutes. We then found a &quot;cyber bar&quot; on side street south west from hotel where it was 3yuan / hour.Went to Chinese opera (a trip organised through hotel) which was okay but a bit overpriced for an hour performance. Also considered the Great Wall trip through hotel for about 300 yuan pp but found a far cheaper price (150 yuan pp) at a travel agent on the side street south of the church next to the Tianlun.If you need to call home, you need to buy an IP card (rather than an IC card) and you can then make cheaper phone calls back home from the hotel room.Also stayed in Park Plaza hotel in Beijing - comparing the two, I would recommend the Tianlun. Although the Park Plaza is more chique and modern, the Tianlun rooms are still excellent and the hotel has more character. Furthermore, the Tianlun location on the Wanfujing High Street was extremely useful and very close to Forbidden City and other tourist things. Apr 27 2017 	Beijing by foot	We chose this hotel because the price was reasonable and the location was near the Imperial Palace. The hotel was much nicer than we had expected for the price. It had a lovely, huge inner atrium which was especially nice in the winter. The room was satisfactory. But what we liked most was being able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. We only had to take the subway once, to a distant duck restaurant. To stay within our budget, we didn't eat at the hotel. Instead we found noodle shops (with pictures) within a block of the hotel. Apr 16 2017 	Tianlun Dynasty is a great hotel	I want to recommend the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel. It turned out to be a great choice. Location is fabulous, next to the main commercial shopping area and walking distance to Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City. It is not on the American hotel circuit, so it has an international clientele, which we prefer. Has a beautiful central atrium--complete with palm trees and fountains and soft music in the evening--which provides a lovely haven from the rigors of Beijing street life. Yes, perhaps its a bit tacky, but still a nice environment. Warning: make sure you get an outside room, with street exposure, rather than on this atrium. Other reviews have warned that you can hear the music at night, and I think it is probably true. If you can splurge, reserve a higher floor, with open views. We had a lovely view of the Forbidden City on the 10th floor. This is the Executive Floor, a bit more expensive, but you get free breakfast, so I believe it evens out. (We got a good deal on hotels.com) The staff is lovely, although not many speak much English, which is true of Beijing in general and part of the experience. But the concierge was able to write where we wanted to go in Chinese so that we could show it to the cab driver, and the travel desk was very helpful. We booked a car and guide from the hotel for days when we wanted to have an easier time getting around. Apr 15 2017 	great stay	had a great 2 night stay at this hotel. Great location, very clean spacious rooms with huge bed , seating area and smart bathroom. The staff were very friendly, helpful and spoke good English.We were only in for breakfast which had a good selection of foods.We ordered room service the night we got there and had the most delicious club sandwiches ever!!Unfortunately, we did not even see the pool area due to the time constraints of our trip but would definately recommend this hotel.It is a 30 minute walk, 5 min taxi ride, from Tiananmen Square . Apr 5 2017 	Luxurious Stay	Tidy and neat hotel with a good location. Extremely good brekfeast! Mar 4 2017 	Great Service!	I stayed at Tianlun Dynasty Hotel for a week during the end of February. I would recommend it to anyone!- The service was very friendly and reliable. Most of the staff had knowledge of English and a few were very fluent.- My room was spacious and very clean. I upgraded my room to the executive floor and the &quot;extras&quot; were worth it. There's a lounge with coffee and finger foods available at certain times and there's always an employee on standby to help with your room if needed.- Hotel location was excellent and couldn't have been any better.- I ate at the hotel restaurants a couple of times...it was a little pricey, but the quality of the food was well worth the money.Food tips: - Try the peking duck in the restaurant in the basement. Pricing is moderate and it tastes great!- If you get room service, try the club sandwich!I will stay at this hotel the next time I'm back in Beijing. Feb 27 2017 	perfect Location	I stayed here in Feb 2017. I found the location was great and the staff were really helpful. The room was very clean and spacious with the biggest bed I have ever seen. The courtyard is lovely for having a relaxing evening drink but be warned its not cheap. The same is said for the mini bar it was madly over priced but you get that in every hotel. There is a shop just across the road where you can get drinks for your room at a 10th of the price. I would defiantly stay here again. Feb 24 2017 	Nice	We stayed here for 4 nights during a trip round China. It was chosen after eading reviews on here. It was a nice hotel, not luxurious but adequate. It was conveniently located being a short walk from Tiananman Square. The staff were friendly and helped us arrange a car to take us to the Great Wall.Overall a nice convenient hotel. Feb 8 2017	One of the nicest hotels i have been to in China	I stayed at this hotel for 3 days on business. The staff was very friendly and could all speak relatively decent english with some staff being able to speak proficiently. I think a few of the workers went to school in canada, austrailia, and the USA. The facilities were very clean and service was excellent. The highlight of the stay is the big open concept courtyard in the middle of the hotel. I spent a fair amount of time just relaxing and enjoying the environment.I stayed on the dynasty floor (10th floor) which offers guests alot of vip services such as conference center, coffee and drinks and snacks, its own receptionist, english magazines and newspapers, and discounts at the restaurants.There are alot of restaurants to choose from at the hotel. I think there was at least 3 chinese cuisine restaurants alone. shanghai style, hunan style with peking duck and an upscale cantonese restaurant with shark fin soup and abalone. The restaurants are not cheap but the food is delicious.I would come back here on vacation in beijing. There are many historic sites and shopping districts very close to the hotel. pricing listed on their website is pretty high but u can book the hotel for a fair price on most online hotel booking websites.i wish i brought my camera to take pictures of the hotel. There was a few special events happening and the decorations were unbelievable. Nov 9 2006 	Tianlun Dynasty-A great hotel	We stayed in the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel in Beijing for 5 days after a 12 day cruise. I must say we enjoyed our stay in Beijing and this hotel more than the cruise. The hotel room (9th floor) was large, clean, and comfortable. The hotel service was great. People at the desk and guest services spoke English and were most accommodating. Anyone who couldn't understand what we wanted quickly ran to get someone who did. We didn't take advantage of their many services but did go to 2 of their restaurants and 3 tours they offered. The hotel is beautiful and right on Wangfujing Street. (The main street in Beijing) Taxis were not expensive in Beijing but the drivers knew no English. The ones we used were very nice and the hotel doorman told them where we wanted to go. (Always carry your hotel name and address written in Chinese to show the driver) on your way home.We would stay there again if ever in Beijing and would recommend it to everyone. Bill &amp; Dona Johnston, Boring, Oregon USA Sep 22 2006 	Average tourist hotel - but good for China w/ a great location	The Tianlun Dynasty Hotel is located centrally in the center of Beijing on Wangfujing Street. Our tour guide claimed it to be a 5-star hotel, which perhaps for China, it is; however, it is definitely not a 5-star hotel. It IS a good hotel - comparable to a Sheraton and the likes and has most of the standard hotel amenities. The staff is cordial and the biggest plus is that hotel guests get 10 minutes of internet access at the business center free (after that, it's 2 yuan per minute or about 25 cents per minute). The buffet breakfast at the hotel is ok - has your standard western breakfast (eggs made to order, cereals, various breads &amp; danishes, bacon, sausage ...) as well as some Chinese food (rice porridge, dim sum, etc). But overall, the breakfast isn't as good as some other breakfasts at hotels in China. Overall, a good hotel for tourists looking for a central location and decent rooms (clean, decently appointed, enough Chinese &amp; international TV stations, private bath, mini-bar, etc.). Aug 2 2006 	Comfortable stay	My Husband and I were in Beijing for a conference and spent 8 nights at the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel. We opted to stay in the city and taxi to the conference center north of the city. This hotel is in an excellent location. It is a 2 km walk to Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City and a 5 min taxi ride to the Silk Market, Temple of Heaven and other popular attractions. The hotel sits on Wangfujing Dajie a main shopping street with several malls and stores. Plus, there is a grocery store across the street in the basement of one of the malls where you can purchase large bottles of water and snacks. The hotel concierge will write out cards for you in Chinese to give to your taxi to drive you anywhere in the city. Buy a city map ahead of time and be prepared for the taxi to shuttle you all around the city to take you to your destination 2 blocks away. We took full advantage of the food options available at Tianlun. The buffets are pricey, but it was a great way for my husband to try some more adventurous cuisine. Our main complaint with the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel is similar to others; the walls are thin and it can seem a bit noisy at times. Since the a/c was on almost the entire time, it offered white noise, which masked some of the noise in the hallway and on the street. The staff are very helpful and speak English well. Don't expect this to be a 5 star hotel. If you want newer and fancier, book a room across the street at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, which is on the higher end of accomodations. That said, we found the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel very comfortable and a great price for its location and services. Jun 26 2006	Great location great stay	We spent 4 nights here and it was the perfect base for our stay in Beijing. Great location in the heart of busy shopping district. Room was really comfortable and all the staff were very friendly. Music from the courtyard was noticeable at first but we soon blanked it out. Good breakfast buffet too. Nice calm hotel in very busy city ! Jun 18 2006	Good Choice for Short Stay	I enjoyed a 3 day stay here recently. As other folks mention they have a courtyard with classical music. The local is pretty good as well.Yes, the music does get annoying after a few days but the rooms are good quality and most importantly I was able to get the room for $125/night.If you're going for 2-3 days a good choice at $125. Jun 8 2006 	Really nice hotel!Ask for renovated rooms	We were a group of four people and we reserved for a good price through expedia. I had chosen the hotel based on the reviews on tripadvisor and also on their website. The rooms looked modern and nice and everyone seemed to like the hotel and it's location. We got there after a grueling 30 hour trip from Miami and we had reserved one king-size room for me and my husband and two double beds for our firiends. The check-in was too long,there was only a reservation for two king sizes and it took a while to clear that up. They said they had upgraded us to an executive room (we had booked a superior room) and I felt satisfied. Upon reaching our room,however, I found out that the upgrade was only for our friends and that we had gotten a room staright from the Mao era: dingy,worn out...just plain UGLY! As we were spending 9 nights there,I called reception and asked them to change our room. I had to speak to about three different people before I got the manager.5 minutes later, the bellboy was at our door and showed us to our new room: much much nicer.Smaller, but at least it was renovated.Regarding the noise , that's another problem: Yes, there is music every night in the central indoor courtyard,but it finishes at 10:30 pm.However, and due to the design of this courtyard (really high roof,very beautiful but also great at carrying sound) just the noise of people having dinner/drinks carries up to the rooms when the music is over. I'm not sure how much of that noise can actually be heard inside the rooms that face the inside,since our room was facing the outside and, truth be told, the dingy inside-facing room at least has double wiondow-panes,but when we went to get the elevators you could really feel the way sound carries. Perhaps I am over-sensitive to noise but the outside facing rooms were also a bit noisy due to the traffic outside.Nothing that couldn't be remedied with a good pair of earplugs,though. The other noise complaint comes from the corridors themselves. If what you want is to sleep in, forget it;when people use the corridors and speak, you can hear everything from inside your room...there are no double doors,which would have helped. Another thing I did not like was the massage service: I went down and had one and the woman did not leave the room as I was undressing but rather stood there looking at me.During the massage, her hands went uncomfortably near areas which they should not have gone near,all very awkward and not at all relaxing.The beds were alsop rock-hard in the rooms...I personally like softer beds.All this said, the location is great, walking distance from tianamen,forbidden city and shopping.the pool was nice, the breakfast buffet was also good and for the price we paid it was a good value for money.It was a comfortable hotel, safe and clean with western style bathrooms and rooms,nice people working there,oriental service. May 9 2006	Loved the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel!	This hotel is absolutely wonderful: great English-speaking staff, excellent housekeeping services, clean rooms, and fantastic location. This hotel is gleaming with a 5-star rating, and it truly was a luxurious refuge from the hustle of sightseeing and shopping. Each room had a Western bathroom, A/C, and free internet access. There is an indoor swimming pool; but, don't forget to pack a swim cap (mandatory here). Room service is excellent and the staff is very accommodating. Because I had reserved a room at this hotel later in the trip, I left one heavy luggage with the concierge for two and a half weeks (at no cost; just keep your luggage tag receipt). This enabled us to travel around China without carrying a bag full of souvenirs, and for this, I am so grateful to the Tianlun Dynasty hotel for being considerate to their clients.A taxicab ride from the Beijing airport to the hotel takes about 45 minutes and should cost about 100 yuan. If it's anything more, let the bell boy or bell girl assist you in getting the correct rate, when you arrive.There are plenty of things to do in Beijing. To get to Tian'anmen Square, it is about a 15 to 25 minute walk. St. Joseph Catholic church is next door, and a popular shopping area (Wangfujing Street) is around the corner. Another worthy shopping area is the Silk Market, which is about a 15 to 20 minute cab ride from the hotel. At the Silk Market, be prepared to bargain down the price to 75% of what they're asking. For other activities, such as the Great Wall of China, the hotel has a travel agency that can arrange it for you. Another plus is that there is an ATM on the hotel premises that accepts most cards.I plan on staying here during my next trip to Beijing, and would recommend it to you! Apr 22 2006 	Excellent Hotel......	Spent 6 nights at the hotel. Great location close to restaurants, shopping and 10 min walk form TS. Hotel is well run. Room was very comfortable. The courtyard (center of the hotel) is very nice in the evening when they serve a buffet and have live classical music. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the breakfast buffet. It is decent but not nearly as sumptutious as I found in some less expensive hotels. I would definitely stay there again. Nov 13 2005	Excellent	Great hotel &amp; centrally located! Extremely pleased with my stay. Well-maintained rooms. Excellent service &amp; helpful staff. Executive floor with limited view of forbidden city &amp; complimentary continental breakfast, evening appetizers and drinks (although breakfast buffet included in rate). Very pleased with my stay. Given the bad experience I encountered with the Prime Hotel (also listed as a 4 star hotel), I could not believe the diffence in service &amp; accommodations! Nov 6 2005	A good Hotel	Was offered by Crowne plaza to stay in this hotel after Crowne plaza failed to open on 1/11/05. This hotel is directly oposite the Cowne plaza. Stayed for 3 nights in TianLun Dynasty. A very good hotel, excellent rooms, specially requested prior to booking, twin beded room and was given 1 large bed (5') and 1 large single (4') which was fine with us as we have 2 adults and 1 child. Their standard twin beded room is 2 no of single beds. Front desk is very helpful and efficient, Concige was strong and house keeping is very good. Plus point, in room dining is 24 hours ordered a very good Hainan chicken rice for supper. Location is very good, Macdonalds, Bakery is a short 3 minutes walk away in Tong An market complex. The hawker street is just 3 minutes walk away. Would recomend anyone to stay there. Only minus point is that there is no direct access to this hotel from Wang fu zing. you would have to walk to a side lane to enter through the main entrance. Oct 25 2005	Wonderful hotel	We recently stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of our 18 day tour in China. Room was very nice with a view of the church and open courtyard next door. The inner courtyard was beautiful! We had great breakfast buffets every morning with both full Western and full Chinese choices, including an omelet/egg station. This hotel is downtown just off the main shopping area and is handy to The Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square. We would highly recommend this hotel. Sep 30 2005	Excellent location Aug 31 2005	Tianlun Dynasty and Beijing Aug 1 2005	disappointed Jul 7 2005	Great location but thats about it Jun 3 2005	Great Hotel Mar 28 2005	Tianlun Dynasty's 5 stars well deserved Mar 10 2005 	Quality Hotel Jan 8 2005	nice! Nov 4 2004	Highly recommend! Sep 29 2004	Good night in Beijing"
"Nov 15 2021 	A very friendly hotel .	This is a very friendly hotel , perfectly located on a quiet hutong 5 minutes off WangFu Jing . On the opposite side there is a metro station . Very friendly and helpful staff . Ideal for travellers who want a clean and comfortable place to stay . Aug 22 2021 	Fantastic Service	I experienced a very pleasant 3 night stay at the Tian Rui Hotel recently. The staff were very knowledgable and spoke great English. It is worth pointing out that we ate supper at the hotel restaurant for 2 of our 3 nights in Beijing and not only was the food fantastic, but the restaurant staff were so friendly. They offered such amazing service.The hotel is located on a narrow alley (in a traditional Chinese Hutong), so it was very quiet. But within a 3 minute walk, you are at a very busy street corner with access to the subway (line 5). Hotel is also located very close to a pedestrian street catering to shoppers.A fantastic experience. I would definitely stay there again. Dec 5 2018 	Great Location and Friendly Staff	I stayed at this hotel at the end of an organized tour. We were booked for two nights with the tour and then I stayed an extra five days before switching to another hotel for a 3 week stay. I really appreciated this hotel a lot more after switching to my other hotel. This hotel is conveniently located right off Wangfujing Street and the night market. One of the biggest English bookstores in on Wangfujing street. There is a subway stop (Denhshikou Station) right down the road which is on line 5. The area is pretty safe, there are little shops all the way down the street where you can buy water, soda, food, etc. The hotel staff is very friendly and accommodating. It's not a Super8 anymore and all those signs were taken down. There is hotel restaurant that serves a breakfast buffet which is decent for China standards. They have Internet access for 5yuan for a 1/2 hour or 10 yuan for an hour. It's a lot easier to use their Internet then trying to find an Internet cafe. There are plenty of restaurants around. The rooms are spacious, they had 3 English speaking stations on the TV including HBO which can be nice after a long day of touristy stuff. The bathroom is very nice. The shower is roomy. Everything in the room was very clean and the housekeeping staff was very friendly. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Sep 23 2018 	Great Central Location	What a great inexpensive place for an American to stay! Everyone spoke English quite well, there was western-style and Chinese breakfast item available including eggs cooked to order and coffee. It's centrally located within walking distance to the famous night market, the main pedestrian street, the bank and a really good dumpling restaurant. The subway station is a quick block away at the end of the hutong which can whisk you away to the Forbidden City and other sites. Yet it's on a lovely quiet shaded hutong with little shops to buy fresh fruit and sodas. There is a hair salon/spa next door with lovely friendly folks who spoke no English but were accommodating with massage, facials, and hair styling. We walked in the opposite direction from the main street (Wangfujung Ave.) and in a few minutes were deep into another hutong which was cool with the shade of trees. The hutongs wind around and there are ordinary Beijing folks living their lives away from the hustle and bustle of the pedestrian street and the tourists. Anyway, great place to stay. Oct 30 2015	It is all about value!	I have traveled to Beijing many times in the past decade and stayed in over 12 different hotels. Tian Rui is one of the best. I stay in different hotels because of location or customer preference but when I am traveling on my dime, I stay at Tian Rui.Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Few hotels have ironing boards. This one does. I dislike carpeted rooms in China because they just collect dirt and they seldom clean the carpet. These rooms have hard wood floors.The location is perfect. Close to the city center. However, many taxi drivers would not take me there because they did not know exactly where it was. I got a name card for the garden hotel on the next block because it is right on Wangfujing. The taxi would drop me off at that hotel, then I just had to walk about a block to get to the Tian Rui.It is a great place to stay if it is your first time in Beijing. It is sufficiently Western-friendly to be comfortable but &quot;Chinesey&quot; enough to experience China. In the end, it is the best value I have found in Beijing. Jul 25 2015	Super 8 is Super Great!	Super 8 Tian Rui turned out to be an oustanding value and centrally located. Our courtyard hotel gave away one of our reserved nights to someone else, so they suggested Super 8 instead, just a block and a half away. I thought there was no way I was staying at a Super 8 in China, but after finding out that other hotels were booked, we decided to take a look. Located in the quiet Baishu Hutong, just off of Wangfujing Ave., the Super 8 felt like the bargain luxury hotel that it is not in the States. The doorman greeted us, the front desk staff spoke english, and the modern elevator swept us up to the 4th floor to our suite with two generous twin beds. We had a living room and a bedroom, a moderate sized bathroom that did not smell, a closet, fridge and mini bar, a TV in each room, window seats and many windows, a great air con with remote in each room, hardwood floors, super clean bed linens, clean suite all around, six chairs, two luggage stands, a closed with iron and board, a hairdryer in the bathroom and large shower. All this for Y600 (About $70). The lobby has a small bar and a restaurant that serves a breakfast buffet (Y40) and other meals. We had the buffet once. It was good with many chinese choices and a few american choices including eggs al gusto. You could eat cheaper close by, though, for much less. I would stay here again. Mar 21 2015	Great location price and service	This small hotel is managed by Days Inn. It's just down the street from Wangfujing Street, the main shopping street in Beijing. The rooms aren't huge, but the price is very reasonable (less than $50 per night, if you do a little bargaining) and the &quot;American-style&quot; service is much better than the usual lackadaisical attitude you'll get at other hotels in this price range. I stayed here in November 2013."
"Jun 23 2018 	Nice Hotel	I stayed here during a three day tour of Beijing while I was in China. Overall, it was a good experience. Rooms were very well appointed. Everything had a very modern feel. Surfaces were marble or granite, and the furniture was rich wood. As others have mentioned, the mattress was typical for that region of the world. Beds are extremely firm and require some getting used to. This hotel was no exception. The bathroom offered every necessary toiletrie, from toothpaste to q-tip.Although we didn't spend much time in the hotel, the common facilities were nice. There were a full host of business services, at least one shop for souveniers and miscellanous goods. There was also one cafe, and at least two additional restaurants. One offered a free breakfast buffett, which was both Eastern and Western style. We ate in both restaurants and food quality was on par with restaurants in the surrounding area.The surrounding area is pretty docile. There isn't much in the immediate vicinity. We were there over the Chinese New Year and most places were closed for the holiday. The Pearl Outlet was nearby but was also closed. They did have several statues and stone carvings celebrating the upcoming Olympic games which were neat to see.Overall, this is a great place to stay if you are conducting business in the local area, or are participating in a fully guided tour of the area. Certainly 4-star quality. Aug 4 2017 	Suitable hotel	I did a three day tour through Beijing when I stayed at the Tiantan Hotel. The hotel is pretty nice and the breakfast buffet was very good as well. The hotel is in a weird area though. Its not dangerous, but it is definitely not much of a neighborhood. If you want to go out for dinner you need to take a cab, there is nothing in walking distance. The hotel staff does not speak English that well. When staying there request an upper floor room. I stayed on floor 5 and I could hear noise from the kaoroke bar on the 2nd floor all night. Additionally, I just found out that the hotel just charged my credit card for something I can't figure out. The web addresses for these hotels are impossible to track down. Does anyone know it? Jul 13 2017 	Good hotel near the Temple of Heaven	My family and I stayed at the Tiantan Hotel for 4 nights near the end of June as a part of a 10-day package tour of China. The hotel was part of the tour package for our stay in Beijing and we booked out three rooms. Overall, we liked the hotel, but we do have some nits to pick.The main &quot;nits&quot; that we had:1.) As a family, we wanted 3 rooms that would be near to each other. We were told that they could accomodate this request and we were given 3 rooms that appeared to be next to each other (i.e., sequential room numbers). When we got to our rooms, we realized that despite the sequential room numbers, one room was in actuality down the hall and around the corner (due to a quirk on how the rooms are layed out) and not really near the other two. When we called back downstairs to ask if we can have a closer room than that, we were then told that it was the only room available to us. Not the world's biggest deal, but somewhat annoying when the staff had earlier assured us that all 3 rooms would be next to each other. [Note: The staff's English is only so-so, but my family and I can speak Mandarin, so this was not an issue of being &quot;lost in translation.&quot;]2.) Complete and total lack of variety in their lobby background music. Strange nit you say? For 2 days straight, the lobby background music was the same instrumental version of &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&quot; on INFINITE LOOP. No other song was played (not even another song from Evita). It's amazing how quickly a song can drill into your head when it's the ONLY SONG playing over and over and over... Part way through breakfast in the downstairs restaurant, I wanted to grab some bread to stuff into my ears just to block out the sound and keep my sanity.Beyond these nits, this is a perfectly nice hotel to stay at. The rooms are very clean and nice (though the beds are like most Chinese hotel beds... VERY firm). It was easy to set a wake-up call and our wake-up calls were always on time. As also stated by the previous reviewers, this hotel is near the Temple of Heaven (for which the hotel is named for) and the Pearl Market (great shopping if you love to haggle). It is also right across the street from the Red Theater (the home of the &quot;Beijing Kung Fu Show,&quot; a popular stop for Western tour companies). I can't speak to the nearness of other tourist attractions as our tour bus would pick us up and drive us to the various places and I did not really pay attention to time or distance.The breakfast buffet is not too bad. It has good variety and has probably a 60/40 mix of Western/Chinese food items. In my opinion, the Chinese food items are definitely better than the Western ones. There is also an omelet bar where the chef will either fry eggs or omelets for you.We also had a late dinner in the Rainbow Restaurant one night. We kept the meal simple to noodles, fried rice, and dumplings and the food was very good... especially the dumplings. Mar 25 2017 	Decent business hotel but far away from main sites	This is a typical Chinese business hotel, rooms are decent size and comfortable but nothing luxurious. Remember that all mattresses in Chinese hotels have the firmness of a box spring (foreign hotel mattresses are only marginally better). Good for your back I guess but takes some using to!As another reviewer mentioned, the hotel is convenient for the Pearl Market (10mns walk). Don't forget to bargain hard, 1st counter offer should not be more than 10% of asking price. Don't settle for more than 20% of asking price, if not move on to another vendor. Best deal is on fresh water pearls on the 3rd floor. Hotel is also convenient for the Temple of Heaven (20mn walk) but very far from anything else. You will need a 15 mn ride by cab to any other sites which can stretch to 30mns when there is traffic. Breakfast buffet is so so. American items are a pale comparison to the originals and Chinese items are scarce. Long lines to toast your bread yourself and chronic shortage of butter. If breakfast is not included in your package, go outside the hotel and look for the many eateries (near the Pearl Market) where you can have a great chinese breakfast for a couple of dollars only.This hotel is good for those who are on a tight budget and whose main goal is discount shopping at the Pearl Market, otherwise look for something more central. Mar 12 2016	very nice hotel	We stayed at the Tiantan Hotel in Beijing from March 5-9, 2016. This is a very nice, clean hotel with excellent service. Although most of the staff speak very little English they do their best to accommodate. The rooms are very nicely decorated and each room had slippers and plush terry robes for our use. Other than the nicely appointed rooms probably the best feature of this hotel is it's convenient location to the Temple of Heaven, Tian An Men Square and the Forbidden City. It is also within a ten minute walk to the Pearl Market (awesome shopping!!). We ate at one of the two restuarants (Rainbow Cafe) and the food was awesome. They had a full American/Chinese breakfust buffet each morning that more than filled us for the day. You also have a full service spa/salon on the second floor. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"Nov 13 2021 	Reasonable business hotel	I have stayed at this hotel for about half a dozen times during the past 2 - 3 years. I have always been satisfied with them.The rooms are not large, but there's enough room for the bed and working desk. They have always been clean and perfectly functional.This time, somehow the staff at the reception was not too friendly. The staff at the concierge desk, the doormen and the elevator guards were very polite as always.The location is very good for shopping and sightseeing.This hotel is of good value for money at least with our company rate. Aug 27 2021 	Old weary and very overpiced... oh and badly managed!	4 years ago I checked into the Traders for what I swore would be the last time. Upon arrival they said - oh we made a mistake re your booking, please wait in the louge while we fix it... 1.5 hours later they told me they had no rooms and I would be accomodated at a nearby hotel... which turned out to be a 1 star hovel...Fast forward 4 years and through no choice I arrive at the Traders... and Im told oh sorry we have no room for you... after 40 mins they grudingly &quot;upgraded&quot; me to the &quot;top floor&quot;... The hotel is now very dated, the food ho hum and very expensive. Apr 28 2021 	Ah Beijing!	I went with my family to Beijing last month. Incidently I booked Traders since it is very close to the shopping areas. But the rooms of this hotel are not good at all. Apr 19 2021 	Great for First Time Chine Business Travellers	Excellent Location for a business traveller, especially if you're in China for the first time. Close to the Metro, Silk Market and other Forbidden City. Found the hotel a little expensive though Apr 16 2021 	Its a so-so hotel	Traders Hotel in Beijing is a typical business hotel - Its located very centrally &amp; is bang next to the Guamao subway station. The hotel rooms are quite small &amp; food is average. The hotel has a spa &amp; a gym in its premises. The room rents are quite nominal for a capital city ( ~$160) - My friends who stayed at Holiday Inn Central paid half the price but said the facilities were better. Not too much of recreation like movies, games possible in the room so you are kind of bored watching only few channels on TV. The advantage of the hotel is the location &amp; a lot of places like Silk street, Tiannamen etc is close &amp; thats an advantage. Jan 14 2021 	OK but not worth the price	Staff seems to be getting a little bit lax. Hopethey are not just trying to milk the Shangrila name andwaiting for the China World Tower to open up.Lots of better deals in Beijing now. They don't seem to get the fact that there is a global recessionand top notch service should be given to keep Golden Circle members.Time will tell. Dec 24 2018	Consistenly perfect!	I have stayed at Traders Beijing several times from 1995 through 2018. In 1995 it was just half the size. Returning, only the size had changed. Shangri-la offers the finest hotel experience through well chosen and trained staff, consistent year after year through all the locations in which I have stayed.Aside from this being a fine hotel with the finest service, the location is perfect. Food is always excellent, the hotel spotless. This is a true gem of a hotel, exceedingly well managed. I always feel great as I arrive at the front door. Highly recommend the Horizon Club! Dec 7 2018 	A very likable hotel	Stayed in Traders for 4 nights during 1st week of Dec -08. Must say it is a very likable hotel! First time to China so I am not an expert comparing with other hotels -- but it definitely served my needs. Super friendly staff all over who really have a desire to help out. Internet connection is fairly expensive. I did not sign up, yet I managed to connect to others non-encrypted wireless connections (for free).Clean and tidy. Room is OK, maybe a little bit dull but that goes for many hotels. Very comfy bed. Bathroom could have been bigger. What definitely could have been bigger too is the safe box, which is too small to fit a laptop.Liked the fact that the hotel is in walking distance from the silk and pearl market. Tried the gym, which was OK. Same goes with the breakfast buffet.Would also like to share with you a really good Chinese restaurant (serving delicious roasted duck and plenty of other dishes) at close walking distance from the hotel: Xiao Wang's Home Restaurant. Jun 25 2018 	Strategic location but not really a nice place to stay for vacation...	Well, Beijing is a city where you can still see preserver traditional Chinese buildings and high rise building in a City. It consists of five rings where first ring started from the Forbidden City. Chinese government preserve the building in first two rings and 3rd and 4th ring have the most development. Traders hotel located between 3rd and 4th ring and the is connected with the China World Trade building. The worst part is directly in front of the hotel, there is contruction on going. If you are looking for a place to stay for vacation, it is not really recommended but it is good for those that go for business trip as most of the offices like Motorola and Hewlett Packard are very near to Traders. Silk Road and Yashio where you can purchase all sort of cheap stuff from accessories, clothing, watches, tea pot, silk and et cetera is also very near to the hotel. These two places are really famous where there are no fixed price to an item and it has to depend on individual bargaining power. I suggest slash 80% from the price they tell you. Always remember to walk away if the price is not within your budget. There are a lot of stalls that selling the same item so, don't worry, you will surely get it. Manicure and Pedicure is highly recommended and please DON'T miss it! It's cheap and the quality is really good. You can get this from Yashio complex and the price is fairly the same of all the stalls. Get the O.P.I! For guy, please go for the head, arms and foot massage. It is cheap too! Beijing crispy duck is something you can't miss. I had it at Wang Xiao Hu. It is very near to the hotel as well. It is within walking distance. Please ask the bellboy where is the location. If you go to stall or restaurant that doesn't has a menu, please ask for the price before you order including drinks.I personally don't recommend you to shop for branded stuff in China as they have higher import tax. All and all, Beijing is a nice place to stay if you are interested in Forbidden City and Great Wall of China. The food are really nice too but the air polution is really bad! One more thing, most of them, they don't speak English even the taxi driver. Please prepare the hotel name in Chinese name. After you book the hotel, call the hotel to ask the name of their hotel in Chinese. Hope you have a wonderful trip in China. May 27 2018	Well located moderate hotel	Traders Hotel in Beijing is a midlevel business hotel, that does everything right within its class. It's a sister hotel to the much more luxurious (and more expensive) China World Hotel and is likewise situated within the modern China World complex, which includes a very high end mall, office towers and convention center. The lobby is small and somewhat dated, but the staff is very helpful, from the desk clerks to the elevator attendants. The rooms were small but relatively well kept. The bathroom was also small, with a combination shower/bath. The safe was too small for a laptop, which is a significant shortcoming in a business hotel. They provide complementary fresh fruit and bottled water each day. The internet access was easy to configure, though expensive (140 RMB/day) given the overall price level in Beijing. The breakfast buffet was modest but offers sufficient western and Chinese choices. The location is well suited for tourists, as the hotel sits atop a subway stop (Guamao) on line 1, from which one can easily get to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and other tourist sites. It's also just a few stops to transfer points for lines 2 and 5. Given the state of traffic in Beijing, easy access to the subway is an important plus. It's a short walk along Jiangwuomenwai to the Silk Street market, which offers several floors of souvenirs, t-shirts, knock offs, &quot;silk&quot; pajamas, etc. The shopkeepers are aggressive and haggling is required, but that's half the fun. May 22 2018 	Most Comfortable Bed in China	By far the best aspect of this hotel was the fabulously comfortable bed. Anyone who has spent time in China can appreciate that most beds here are rock hard. Overall the hotel was not standout, particularly with its somewhat hard-to-find location at the back of the World Trade Center, poor access to the street, and ongoing construction outside (but then again, this is China). However, in-room amenities including terrycloth bathrobes and comfy slippers, BBC (so sick of CNN), and - did I mention - the most comfortable beds in China (!), made my stay enjoyable. Apr 18 2018 	Decent Place for Business	This hotel is very centrally located for business travellers, very near to the Kerry Center and adjacent to the China World complex. It is also walking distance to the Pearl Market/Silk Street shopping area. The rooms are comfortable and a decent size. They could be bigger, but I'm not going to complain about that. Several restaurants on site and you can walk through the China World Mall to the China World Hotel and eat at their restaurants as well. The buffet restaurant on site is OK--fine for breakfast. They have quite a nice selection of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, cereals, etc.Staff are very friendly and acommodating. They all go out of their way to say good day and greet you when you enter the hotel. Exercise facilities are fine, but not outstanding. Several treadmills, some bikes and a full set of Cybex machines for weight work-outs. There is a full sauna as well. I believe the hotel has a spa/massage service, but I did not take advantage of it.Overall, for the rates, I don't think you can do much better in Beijing. Mar 22 2018 	Great place for business travelers	My client in Beijing recomended the hotel and I am glad they did. The room was what you would expect for a nice hotel and had a very nice bathroom. They had a good selection of international channels available in English, French, Spanish, German and of course Chinese. They have two resturants and one bar in the hotel but there are two other hotels within walking distance that are owned by the same company and allow you to sign meals to your room. The staff was incredibly friendly and were always available. The hotel is located near the SouthEast part of town which makes it convenient to get to the Business Development Area (BDA) and also close to the city center for access to the forbidden city and Tienamen Square. There is always a line of available taxis right outside the entrance at all hours. Dec 25 2007 	very decent hotel	Me and girlfriend went to Beijing, mainly to travel and see those magificant histroical monumnets in Beijing.Hotel is well manager by Shangri La group, so you do expect good manner staff, good rooms. The location is good good.just 5 mins walk to a SOHO properties, great place to spend time in.Nothing to compare about, unless you are looking a hotel with more style and taste. Dec 14 2007 	Great location good service	This hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of business district, above a great shopping mall, with a subway station that allow me to travel all over the city. Taxi is very cheap also. There is a shuttle bus from the airport although it may take some patience to know which airport bus to take and where to get off. The chinese name of the hotel sounds like &quot;Quao-mao&quot; . Saying that to the bus or taxi driver will help you get to the hotel easier. The staff is super friendly, and very attentive. I always feel very welcome in this hotel. The ratio of hotel staff to customer is amzaingly high. If you enjoy being pampered, this is the place to consider. The room size is adequate, and the room are always clean. There are some thoughts to share here though.(1) The gym (free) is located in China World Hotel nearby. You would have to walk to the shopping mall to get to the gym. It can be kind of inconvenient for some. The gym is WOW nice, so it is worth the walk, I think, (2) The hotel may want to consider upgrading to flat-screen TV.(3) The bathroom floor is very slippery when wet. So be very careful, Hotel should really consider replacing them in any upcoming remodel efforts. (4) There is construction nearby at this time, and can be noisy during some days. If you need to sleep during the day time, you may want to book another hotel at this time. Other the minor items above, this is a great hotel. I definitely would stay here in the future because of the great location and super service. Nov 18 2007	excellent hospitality	Excellent service, staff seemed very eager to please.Varied choice of both continental &amp; asian breakfast.Wasn't too impressed by 'the Oriental' restuarant.We tried a full body massage which was nice.Only drawback was the construction site across the road. Nov 1 2007 	Great business hotel in CBD of Beijing	Traders is a comfortable and well-located hotel for business travelers. Beijing hotel prices continue to increase, but Traders remains a good value, especially compared to its sister hotels in the same area (Kerry Centre and China World) which are posh but at a price. Traders' rooms are small but adequate, the hotel staff are pleasant and helpful, and the location in the World Trade Center makes it easy to shop (also within walking distance of the silk market) or take public transportation if you're daring enough. It is also a short ride to the main train station. I stay at Traders most times I pass through Beijing. Oct 28 2007	A nice place to stay	I spent 2 nights at this hotel on my wa to other locations in China. This is a fantastic Hotel, the staff are friendly at room are nice and clean. Just a little advise for new travellers to Beijing - English is not amazingly popular here. On arrival I showed a taxi driver the address of my hotel, but as it was written in english he didnt have a clue. I had to phone the hotel from my mobile and then pass over the phone to the driver so he would know where to go. The rest of the trip wasn't too bad as I met up with an old uni friend who done all the translating for me :-)Other then the language barrier outside the hotel its a great place to stay. Jul 9 2007	A+	This hotel was centrally located. Great for business and families. Beautiful Lobby, Friendly Staff, excellent service and wonderful rooms. All the amenities you need. Highly reccomend! Jun 7 2007	Great Location Excellent Service!	We went to Beijing to participate in the Skate Beijing 2007 competition. This hotel was chosen because of it's proximity to the rink. Only 2 mins. thru the shopping mall!This is an excellent hotel. I will reccommend it to anyone. It's location is great for business travelers, right in the middle of the Bussines district and just a few steps away from the China World Trade Centre. This is also a family hotel, near shopping malls and accessible transportation. Very helpful staff. They will arrange tours to the Great Wall and other places.The restaurant is EXCELLENT! The best buffet breakfast and dinner I've seen and had the pleasure of feasting on. May 30 2007 	Big hotel big heart	Basd on tripadvisor reviews I chose this hotel over the seemingly more &quot;grand&quot; New World Hotel. I was working nearby so it came down to a decision between the two. I have to say I was very happy with my choice and here's why...1. I somehow managed to book a room on the &quot;Executive Floor&quot; I think it was because I chose to have breakfast included (an extra 10 pounds from memory). It was SUCH A great move. The floor has its own (quick) check in desk, there is free access to the internet, fax, printer (and even shredder) they have happy hour between 5 or 6-8pm every night which include nibbles and open bar (when I say nibbles, let's just say I didnt need to eat dinner after), b'fast is just down the hall (and it's tasty) and lastly and for me (a regular business traveler) most importantly, there is a large space for you to go and work and /or read (they have a selection of books avaible in English). For me this is ideal, in the words of oneof the Starbucks founders it offers the &quot;thrid place&quot; that we all seek, especially when travelling on business. Sometimes you just need to leave your room but youdont want to have to kit up and head out into the world.enough said...2. the gym is well equipped and is complete with sauna, steam room and spa.3. you have access to the facilities at the nearby New world hotel - i checkied out the facilities, they are amazing- but it is a bit annoying to have to make your way through the underground mall to the hotel and to be honest , i found the modest equippment at the Traders suficient for a workout and relaxation.4. the staff, very friendly and helpful (ok, so their English is not great) but who cares? 5. location.. if you are working near the world trade centre, this hotel is convenient 6. the reviews said the rooms were small but on the exec floor the rooms are much the same as any normal sized 4 star Europeanhotel (believe me I travel A LOT!)7. You get all this for less than a night in a 4 star hotel in Europe EXCEPT you feel like a person NOT a number... So as I said, I checked out the New World and I must say WOW WOW WOW, the lobby is something to behold and to be honest I didnt actually see inside the rooms but as soon as I walked in I had the feeling that another reviwer described, that the hotel was more like a production line than a hotel. It was teeming with people, there were cars coming and going.. sure it felt large and exceptionally grand but it mostly felt cold and unwelcoming.... so I was and remian happy with my choice.Maybe it was because I was lucky enough to land on the executive floor or maybe I have too little experience with hotels in Asia to kow better but this hotel rated highly for me, I would definitely stay there again! Happy travels :-) May 11 2007 	Functional Hotel	Stayed here on a biz trip in early May. Hotel was in a convenient location, part of the China World Complex (shopping centres, offices, China World Hotel).If there are people picking you up or meeting you at the hotel, make sure you tell them that it's Traders (Guo Mao) cos the whole complex in mandarin is called Guo Mao and some people confused the Traders hotel with China World Hotel, its more luxurious sister hotel. The room in Traders in on the small side, but functional and clean. Room service is quite good, with good range of items on the menu. Apr 25 2007	Very comfortable	Spent 3 nites here as part of a tour package and really liked the property. Was too busy to check out the area, but the small room was equipped with almost EVERYTHING you could think of for a nice stay. Especially liked the restaurant staff. They were relaxed and accomodating and took all the various visitors from all over the world in stride and just seemed to enjoy it all. Would definitely consider another stay in this facilitiy. Accomodating and very comfortable. Mar 3 2007 	Traders Hotel Beijing - a good business hotel	For people who are familiar with the Traders Hotel chain, this Beijing property will be familiar. The rooms are Trader-sized ie. perhaps smaller than other hotel chains but adequate for business people who only use the room to sleep in. The hotel staff are all very friendly, pleasant &amp; efficient.The best thing for me was the location. The hotel is part of the World Trade Center complex which meant that I didn't have to venture out into the Beijing smog (if I didn't want to) to get to offices &amp; shops. The underground system, with upmarket brand shops &amp; familiar restaurants &amp; cafes, provides a easy link between the hotel &amp; offices.Another good thing about the hotel is that it is only a 10-minute walk (this time you have to walk outside in the smog) to the 5-storey Silk Market, where you can buy all kinds of things you have set your hearts on. Oct 19 2006 	business class hotel	the traders is part of the shangri-la chain of well managed hotels (save for the one in shenzhen). it is better known for its convenient location. if you can tolerate a small room, this hotel would be a natural choice. what makes the traders a special hotel is its attentive english speaking front office manager, service manager-concierge, and staff. Oct 12 2006	Good - but overshadowed by China World	A very good hotel, but definitely living in the shadow of the China World.It was disconcerting to be regularly accosted by &quot;ladies of the night&quot; on walking between the Traders and the China World. Sep 14 2006 	Quiet Impressive Brekkie Jul 3 2006	Businessman's hotel in a not too convenient neighborhood Apr 18 2006	Hotel OK and above average Mar 22 2006 	A very decent hotel Dec 28 2005	An very-OK 3-star hotel May 16 2005 	Good choice Mar 30 2005	Great hotel for Beijing - good location Jan 11 2005	Recommended With Minor Reservations Nov 6 2004 	Comfortable hotel but nothing special Sep 13 2004	Excellent Business Hotel Sep 13 2004	Buen Hotel Jul 3 2021 	?????

"Nov 26 2021 	Modern hotel with great customer service	I am in Beijing for 2 months business assignment and i have been staying in Traders Upper East hotel for almost a month now.The main purpose for me to choose this hotel is its price is relatively cheap in this area and it is close to the office (with 5 minutes taxi ride). The hotel is new and modern, a typical business hotel, its facility is also good, especially the gym which it opens till 11pm everyday to cater for business traveler. It is a very neat consideration for a gym-goer like me.Customer service in this hotel is also superb, i checked-in with no fuss at all and the stay till now has been pleasant. Last week my room's air-con unit started to generate noise and when i informed the reception, they instantly upgrade me to the corner room with better view and space with no questions asked. The only complaint i have for this hotel is the choice of breakfast in the morning. I have been staying in this hotel for almost one month now and the breakfast buffet types remained unchanged.I would recommend this hotel to business travelers but not tourists because it is located in the &quot;new&quot; business district, quite far from all the tourist attractions and the hotel is not near the subway station. May 31 2021 	perfect business hotel great value	Have stayed three times here in last six months, once during soft open and twice recently. Western bathrooms, internet always works, the rooms are clean, service sharp and food is above-average. The iSpa in basement, while expensive, is an excellent chill-out. Location is perfect for airport and getting around the perimeter of the city, though it's still new enough to sometime confuse the cab drivers. Dec 24 2018 	The Shangri-La Chain NEVER Disappoints	Needing a place to overnight between my work in Zhangzhou and my flight out of Beijing home, I started (as I always do when traveling in Asia) with my membership at the Shangri-La chain. For those unfamiliar with this chain, it's a great, four star hotel that caters to business travelers from all countries.The Traders is situated about halfway between the Beijing airport and the center of the city so it's perfect as a jumping off point in either direction. For a fee, they arranged for me to be picked up at the airport and then taken back in time to make my flight the following afternoon. Even before checking in, the staff was seeing to all my needs. I had emailed the Guest Relations Officer asking about going to Mass Sunday morning. She responded with all the information I needed on the closest Catholic church. The driver was waiting for me after I collected my luggage and the car was stocked with bottled water for the short, twenty minute drive to the hotel. The Guest Relations Officer (Vivian Gong) with whom I had traded emails earlier, met me at the door, ushered me to my room and, because I'm a member, just had me sign the paperwork in my room. She asked if the church she had found would be acceptable and which Mass I would like to attend. She said that she would arrange a wake up in time for me to meet a prearranged taxi that would take me to church.The room was a good size with all the amenities (soaps, shampoo, razor, toothbrush &amp; toothpaste, comb, and fully stocked minibar complete with adult beverages, soft drinks, and snackfood. The food from room service was excellent and the staff was superior to the point of feeling very pampered.The following morning I got in and out of a day of church and shopping in Beijing without a hitch and, when the time came, Ms. Gong was there to accompany me from the front desk to the waiting car.I always expect the best from the Shangri-La chain and have never been disappointed. Nov 20 2021 	?????????"
"May 9 2021 	Fantastic hotel would stay again.	Loved this hotel. Rooms were very nice, hotel staff so friendly nothing too much trouble for them.The swimming pool with the spa pool was an ideal way to finish a day sight seeing. The location is a staright walk to the forbidden city and square it will take about 15 mins. You will pass the wangfuing shopping complex on the way. Lots of shops, mcdonalds starbucks a great stop on the way.We ordered room service, good choice of western food if you have had enough chinese food, reasonably priced.Taxis to summer palace from the hotel was only 700 yen about £7! We hired a driver to take us to the wall really made our trip and only cost 800 yrn for the full day for all of us - about£80 in total, highly recommend this. Beijing is a wonderfully city, safe and easy to get around. If you have never been go, you will love it! Mar 28 2021 	Great Service Great Room Overall Great Experience!!!!!!!	Ok so I stayed here for 4 days and I recommend it to anyone who is visiting Beijing. It's very near all the main attractions and its a beautiful luxurious room. Also the service is fantastic and you can go downstairs to the basement to go swimming and to get pampered. Also the staff are very friendly and help out when they can. One thing I recommend is not to phone for a taxi using there service though as they charge you double than what a normal cab would cost as they hire out plush taxi's instead of your normal cab. It should only take 20 minutes to get to the main airport from this hotel and no more than 80 quai for the taxi fair. Anyway hope this helps. :) Dec 6 2018 	Quiet Hotel	Walk of 4 long blocks to subway station. Kind of inconvenient. Found out there are scheduled (every half hour) airport shuttle bus to - from Beijing National airport. Do not try to carry luggage taking subway which was told by this hotel. Email to this hotel was not answered. Room 508.Air conditioning does not work. Just blowing fan. Toilet water gets in very slowly after flash. Stain everywhere, carpet, lamp shade, Room service food is priced reasonable, OK and quick, but only a few selections. Our group stayed at 7 different rooms, all air conditioning are poor to deliver cool air.Room 709:Shower stall leaked water at every shower due to non-closure of rubber seals. Shower items, including lotion, soap, bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner not replenished each day. Room temperature remained constant despite attempts to lower degrees. Shower items were of excellent high quality, especially the hand lotion. Very nice complement of bath items offered, including sewing kit, toothbrush, paste. Shower bath gel dispenser on wall was difficult to squeeze especially for those people with smaller hands. Noise control in each room was excellent.Very nice swimming lap pool. Surprise, so quiet, no body use it.Very nice rec room down stairs too. Gym not fully equip. Oct 4 2018 	Loved the Xinhai	Absolutely loved this hotel. The room was gorgeous, the restaurant was excellent, the staff were friendly and very helpful and the location was ideal. The travel office staff were very helpful in organising a taxi for us to go to the Great Wall, even offering their mobile telephone numbers in case we had difficulties communicating with the taxi driver, how helpful is that? There is a beautiful swimming pool which sadly we did not have time to use, as well as a sauna, spa, 10 pin bowling alley, table tennis and a gym. Everything you could possibly want. All staff we met were very friendly and polite, desperate to help in any way they could. We felt thoroughly spoit the whole time we were there. Great location just 10 minutes walk from a couple of underground stations, taxis on hand the whole time. We couldn't fault this place at all. Aug 26 2018 	Surprisingly Good	Stayed at the Xinhai during the Olympics and was a little wary of a Chinese 4 star but was very pleasantly surprised.The Hotel is a modern well maintained property in a great location, clean and with large well appointed rooms.Jinbao Street is only 10 minutes walk from one of the main shopping streets of Beijing and the underground is less than 5 minutes walk away. In the street are a number of upscale hotels (eg the Regent), restaurants (eg Lei Garden) and car showrooms (Rolls, Ferrari, Maserati) which says something about the area. A new Mall is about to open in the street which will have many of the main upmarket fashion brands.The Hotel itself has some good leisure facilities (a very nice pool, 8 lane bowling alley, table tennis and 4 pool tables) which are reasonably priced and well maintained.The breakfast buffet is excellent.However, there are some annoyances, the lack of English of most staff makes communication difficult when things do not work, the bed is very hard (about as much give as a table) and only CNN and ANX English TV channels.All in all the Xinhai is a very good hotel for a 4 star but is properly classified as that and not a 5 star. Outside of the Olympic period, I am sure it offers great value for money. Jul 18 2018 	Best Valued Hotel in Beijing	I did a lot of researching before I chose a hotel in Beijing and I was impressed with the mostly good reviews of the Xinhai Jinjiang. The pictures looked good (but we know how sometimes they exaggerate) and the price was right. I have to say that I was greatly impressed as soon as I walked into the lobby of the hotel and further impressed when I saw my gorgeous room!I stayed for the long weekend and received nothing but excellent service from beginning to the end. The porter was always asking to help me with my shopping bags, the attendant outside always tried to grab me a taxi, the waitress was extremely polite and even the swimming attendants catered to my every need - even when I was the only one in the pool area. It was extremely clean everywhere I went. The hotel room was huge and comfortable. They had excellent complimentary items including toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, shampoo, sewing kit, etc. and they even had complimentary water. They had nice gorgeous, big comfy towels. My bed was turned down every night before I got back to the hotel room. I was in awe of how welcome I felt and how comfortable they made me feel.I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel. It is a service worthly of a Hyatt or Hilton but with a very affordable price. If I ever go back, I will not consider any other hotel. I am returning to the Xinhai. Oh, and the location was perfect. It was a 15 minute walk to Wangfujing Street and another 10 minutes to Forbidden City and Tiannaman Square. Perfect! Jun 18 2018 	Great Hotel in Beijing	I stayed in the Beijing Xinhai Jinjiang Hotel twice, each time for two nights. It is a ten-minute walk from the north end of Wangfujing, Beijing's pedestrian shopping street. It is about twenty-five minutes from Tiananmen Square, which is off the south end of Wangfujing. It is in a mostly residential area with lots of good little restaurants on the street beside the hotel. The rooms are big and very comfortable. The bathrooms are somewhat lavish. The buffet breakfast is really superb (additional $20 per person per day). The hotel's huge swimming pool is spectacular. The hotel's staff in all departments is gracious, enthusiastically helpful, and very competent. Apr 9 2018	Total Disappointment	I had read such rave reviews on Trip Advisor about this hotel that I was really looking forward to staying here during our week long trip to Beijing. The hotel when it was new I'm sure was absolutely beautiful but now the rooms have seen much better days. They look run down and dirty. The bathroom had a massive stand up shower which was great for us but not very good if you value a good soak at the end of the day. They initially had booked us in a room right in front of the elevators so we asked them to change which they did, so that was positive. The hotel is right on the corner of a fairly busy intersection so don't expect to sleep in past 7, that's when the traffic gets busy and the horns get loud. We had issues booking things through the hotel....the concierge do NOT handle that job although some of them make you believe that they do. The hotel has a separate ticket office area where one of the ladies was extremely helpful for us from booking events to writing down destinations in Chinese. Very few of the staff speak fluent English but most of them will at leasty say hello. We had problems with the driver of the private car we hired for a day &quot;recommending&quot; a place to eat that charged us the foreigner price. We were extremely disappointed in that. We thought that by staying in a higher end hotel we wouldn't run into things like that but it seems that's not the case in Beijing. Always make sure Taxi drivers start their meter and always have the name of your hotel written in their language...even with a map they will say they don't know how to get there. The positive thing about the hotel is that it's within walking distance to the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven and the main Wangfujing shopping district. You can walk to the Yashow market if you're up to it but it's a solid hour walk. I think the main issue I had with this hotel was that it didn't seem to cater to very well to English speaking guests. I would recommend staying at a more global chain like the Hilton, Park Plaza etc. This hotel fell really short of what I was expecting.... Sep 3 2007 	Great price for a great room	We booked one night at the JinJiang Hotel in Beijing, after searching hotels on Trip Advisor. The price seemed out-of-line with the other listings we had reviewed. Thinking that the price was too cheap comparatively we assumed there was some catch. We were very very pleased and shocked to find that not only was the JinJiang Hotel, a good value, at 850 RMB/night...it was a downright steal ! Our room was very new and clean with very stylish decor. The lobby is very lush with marble and crystal everywhere. Although a bit Las Vegas for my personal taste, you can't say it looked anything but expensive. We decided immediately to book additional nights for the remainder of our stay. The restaurant is pleasant, with a nice selection of standard andsome local foods. The price was somewhat expensive, since we did not book a room at a breakfast-included rate. Certainly a small issue to note, when the overall experience was positive. The staff were extremely helpful; struggling with their English, they made every effort to make sure that our needs were attended to.A great great value at the price we paid. Aug 7 2007 	All it still needs is a trendy cosy bar.	I have no idea at what rate I stayed in this hotel, but if it was really around $100 then it's extremely good value. Let me think very hard if there was something I didn't like..I liked:- lovely large room with huge flatscreen and prive pc- very posh bathroom (but hip)- amazing breakfast- pool, bowling, billiards, massages- location- helpfull staff- etc. etc.All I can really think of, is that it didn't have a trendy cocktailbar to end the day with your collegues/friends/partner..Recommended! Jul 27 2007	A very decent hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights in mid-July 2007. I had planned on staying at the Park Plaza but they were already booked up as I did not make any prior reservations. As per the previous review, I also fly standby. However, we find this hotel to be a really good deal. The room was very spacious and comfortably fit 3 people. The service was excellent and the bathroom were very clean with lots of counter space.. It was about a 15 min walk to Wangfujing from the hotel. The only complaint I have is that management 'shuts down' the air-conditioning around 3am for a few hours. The fan is still running but I did notice a difference especially since it was summer and very, very humid outside. Other than that, I was overall very pleased and will consider staying there again. Jun 18 2007 	What a Lucky Find	We fly stand by so we had to book a hotel at the airport, which as it turns out is cheaper. I had not researched this hotel but the ones I had were not available so we went for it. How lucky for us, a beautiful hotel with great service. We were fortunate enough to have Rachel Wang, the assistant manager, help us set up an overnight trip to Jin Shanling by interpreting for us. I mentioned that date is our anniversary and less than an hour later she came to our room with a fruit basket and flowers with a Happy Anniversary note. Now that's excellent service!!! We also used their travel booking and business service center and all were pleasent experiences. I had read many reviews that stated problems with English not spoken and dirty rooms. None of that existed here. The rooms are beautiful, and the bathrooms are really nice and very clean. The entire staff was friendly and professional and went out of their way to help. Oct 12 2006 	Great place	Wonderful stay.Excellent western style buffet breakfast.American items on coffee shop menu. rooms spacious and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful, ATM in lobby. Great massaging pool after a hard day of sightseeing.Easy walk to other restaurants and shops. Oct 4 2006	An excellent hotel in Beijing that caters for non Chinese	Stayed here with an educational school group from Australia. Very nice hotel, clean, modern, good facilities including gym, and 8 lane indoor tenpin bowling centre!! Foreign exchange facilities. Good breakfast selection - American and Chinese and food quality very good. 6 minute walk to the nearest Starbucks, or 12 minutes to KFC or McDonalds if you've had enough Chinese food by this stage of your trip.Also, many staff had a good command of English.Bedrooms a good size. Very hard beds (but then that is normal in China) but great pillows and continental quilts. Excellent bathroom/shower.Overall, first rate. Would definitely recommend. Nov 16 2007	Mucha apariencia pero..... Jan 15 2006	Un hotel splendide"
"Sep 3 2021 	Good base camp for Beijing	We stayed for 5 nights at the Xinyuan Inn and used it as a base camp for our exploration of Beijing. I'm rating it as 'very good' for what it is: a good budget choice for those who want to escape the Western hotel 'bubble,' but don't want backpacker accommodations either. Pros:- Great location within reasonable walking distance of many sights- Good bus access that's easy to figure out for short hops to sights and subway- OK access to subway (15-20 minute walk, faster if you figure out the buses)- Grocery store within a block- Great view of the Drum Tower from our room- Reliable air conditioning: vital!- Value for money: at roughly $50 per night for two people, this was an economical choice over Western brand hotelsCons:- Most (not all) staff not exactly super helpful; not a huge surprise in Beijing- Breakfast selection was meh and available for just one hour per day (7:30-8:30)- Street noise could be a problem, particularly on weekends - earplugs usefulWhile the property is technically located in a hutong, and thus off busy streets, the hutong is rather modern and touristy by hutong standards - not a bad thing. Beijing suggestions:- For those who enjoy the outdoors and like hiking, strongly recommend Cycle China's 'Best-sell One Day Secret Great Wall Hike'- Hutong bike tour (we also used Cycle China for this) Jul 14 2021 	A Gem of an Experience - we'll stay here again	We stayed here during the Beijing Olympics and we were soooo happy with our choice. We were nervous at first staying in a more traditional hotel, but when we saw the Hutong it was on and how much more authentic it was (not very western, but they do have western toilets) - we were so happy. If you're looking for how the Chinese stay when they travel - stay here. It does not have a hostel feel at all and it's in the heart of a very fun and active area.The rooms are smaller than Western style, but they provide enough room to get ready in the morning and to sleep. The beds were on the hard side though - so if you like soft beds, you won't find them here. But I think the ambiance, location, breakfast and more authentic experience make up for it. Bring your own toiletries, I don't remember them being anything exciting. Breakfast in the morning is ok and included in the price; although there's a 7-11 type store and a traditional Chinese breakfast restaurant just steps away. One downside is the metro is a bit of a hike in warmer weather; although taxi's are really cheap."
"Aug 24 2018 	Gold Medal for the XiXI Youyi Hotel	This was a hotel secured by the travel company for the Beijing Olympics on a &quot;bronze&quot; package, i.e the third ranking hotel.To be fair it was all we expected and more! Located a mile WEst of Tianammen Square it is a 10 minute walk away from Xidan Subway station on Line 1. It is one of the city's main shopping districts and major department stores are on hand as well as a mall dedicated to Wedding Dress shops!The main reception to the hotel is on Level 8 of the building and the building is spacious. On Level 4 is a fine Korean Restaurant which is well worth visiting - an all you can eat buffet which is excellent.Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the service at the hotel is very friendly and attentive. Breakfast is served in the hotels' main rstaurant on the 8th and again it is a comprehensive buffet with Western and Oriental food available. Oct 15 2017	Good location with comfortable room and wonderful breakfast	Better than expected...good location nearby shopping area and supermarket. Room is big with LCD screen though most channels are in Chinese. Comfortable bed with space to place all belongings. Variety of breakfast choice...chinese and american. There are many resturants on this building.Recommend all to stay...not far from many tourist spots by taxi and underground. Aug 25 2017	Much better than I expected...	I stayed in this hotel while on a school trip to China. It was much better than I expected! When our bus arrived to the hotel, the staff took all of our bags off the bus and up to the lobby and then to our room after we checked in. While waiting for check in, staff treated us to plates of fruit and pastries. Staff amazingly spoke English and understood what we needed. With a currency exchange office in the hotel, this was also a major convenience. There was also some restaurants in the hotel and shopping close by. The rooms were spacious and pretty comfortable. The only negative was the temperature was a little warm in the rooms. It was hard to cool down even when the thermostat was all the way down. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay here for being a mid class hotel. Jun 28 2017 	Hard to find? but worth the the effort!	I have just returned from a one week stay at the XIXI FRIENDSHIP HOTEL BEIJING. It was my first time in China, and I speak no Chinese, My B.A. flight arrived at 5.45 in the morning, and there was nothing open at the airport, and as I had no Chinese money I had to wait until 7.30 for the beaureaux de change to open. The easiest way to get to the hotel from the airport is to go through exit number 11 and there is a lady standing at what looks like a newspaper sellers booth, 'she doesn't speak any English' but just give her 16 Yuan (fixed fare) and she will give you a ticket, get on bus number 2 or 3 which are right in front of you, stay on the bus until everyone else gets off, it's about a 50 minute journey, the bus stops at the bottom end of the road in which the hotel is located, right near the Xidan metro station, walk up the road for about 3 or 4 minutes and the hotel is on the left, it doesn't look anything like a 4 star hotel from the outside, I had to ask a chap standing in the doorway if I was in the right place, but once you are there you will not be dissapointed. As another reviewer has mentioned the beds are very hard, but that would be my only complaint. a truly outstanding hotel, the reception is on the 8th floor (very strange) I was on a bed and breakfast board basis, and the breakfasts were very impressive (but avoid the baked beans as they are as hard as bullets)The hotel staff were very helpful throughout my stay, and I have no hesitation in reccomending this hotel. One of the best that I have ever stayed in. May 29 2017 	Overall - Not bad at all!	Great location where you can literally cross the street and find shopping, cafe shops, restaurants, taxi service, and a short walk (in my opinion) to the subway. The staff was friendly but don't expect too much English being spoken. Very few employees could understand me. Restaurants in hotel were also pretty good with free Western breakfast buffet. Beds are on the hard side (board-like), but very clean and enough room to feel comfortable. Stayed a week. Dec 27 2016 	Not bad...would go back again.	We stayed at the hotel in mid-November of 2016. The room was quite big but I was disappointed that we were given two twin beds rather than a queen/king bed since I prefer to sleep in the same bed as my husband. The bathroom was really nice but it was disappointing that despite the appearance the shower did not kick out enough pressure to have a good shower. Obviously labor is cheap in China as the one meal we had at the hotel we had 8-9 people serving us which made it somewhat uncomfortable to have so many eyes looking at us while we ate. We did walk around the hotel and the supermarket was close by which was convenient to get drinks and snacks. There wasn't a lot of information provided by the hotel so we weren't sure what services they offered beside the spa that was located in the hotel grounds (room service, business center, etc.) Also, there is a mall nearby but I didn't buy anything there since I thought Hong Kong had better deals. Regardless, the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly (but don't expect someone to speak English) and I would stay there again. Sep 17 2016	Convenience in a local shopping area	We paid 900 yuan for a huge king bed room and added 2 single beds for our kids and there was still plenty of space to manoevre around . Being on the 10th floor corner room, we had a panaoramic view of Beijing as half of the walls of the room were windows. It was also directly opposite the Xidan shopping center and literally next door to a supermarket so was excellent for location. However, the plumbing system seemed to be a problem as the shower would get flooded after a couple of minutes. But I must say the service was excellent and they did not hesitate to send someone up to fix the problem almost immediately, infact they sent 3 personnel up to get the problem sorted out even though I called them at midnight. Also the shopping in Xidan was very much catered for the local adults and I was looking more for kids clothing and things which they did not have."
"Aug 27 2021 	Surprisingly good business hotel but not well located for tourism.	I stayed in the Xiyuan Hotel on a recent business trip to Beijing, as it was located near to the offices of our business partner. I wasn’t expecting that much going in, but it turned out to be far better than my expectations. Upon arrival, it looked a little like a war zone out front, with all the paving torn up, obviously under going some kind of renovations.It isn’t all that well located actually, a long 1 hour drive from the airport. It is right across the street from the zoo, but far away from the central city where most tourist attractions are located, thus not the handiest spots for tourists. There are however a few good restaurants and shops within short walking distance, including a few western ones, like Pizza Hut, Pizza Factory, and a Carrefour supermarket. There are a few good opportunities for walking/running nearby, around the quiet tree-lined canal beyond the zoo.Check-in and check-out were very smooth and efficient. Most of the front desk staff spoke reasonable English so communication wasn’t a problem, however service in general was very ordinary. The hotel is mainly geared toward Chinese businessmen, so not really up to international standards that you’d expect from this category of hotel.The rooms were of average size with comfy king size beds and a small work desk. The rooms were very clean, bright, quiet, and appeared to be reasonably modern and well-maintained. Non-smoking rooms/floors are available so you can escape the tobacco stench common to Chinese hotels. The bathroom was nice enough, however it smelt musty, as if there were a water leak somewhere. Also the stone counter top around the sink was stained and marked, either needing a thorough polishing or replacement. The fruit basket upon arrival was a really nice touch. Free internet was available in the room but it wasn’t very fast.The breakfast, included in the price, was nothing to rave about, but it was sufficient. We didn’t try any of the other restaurants. I went down to use the hotel gym but found it to be “closed for renovation”, a common theme in Chinese hotels in my experience. I had a look through the window and it seemed to be fairly well equipped with both cardio and weightlifting equipment. There is also a lap pool there. Overall my experience there was very good, and much better than expectations. Would I stay there again? Well, for tourism, no. But if I had business in the area, yes I would most definitely stay there again, no complaints. Likes: comfortable good quality rooms. Dislikes: musty bathroom, lack of attention to service, poor location Jul 30 2021 	Good bargain hotel	I stayed one night in the Villas section at the back of the hotel. The room was a bit dated but clean and spacious with fast internet. I paid only 298 RMB (about US $42). No CNN on the TV, but it is fairly quiet. The Sizhimen subway station is about a 20 minute walk or a 10 RMB taxi ride. The zoo is very close and Beijing University is not too far away. If you are looking for elegant lodgings, this might not be the place but I found it quite acceptable. There is a Carrefour right across the street where you can buy almost anything you might need in food, clothing, or gear. May 25 2021 	There's nothing really wrong with this hotel but it's probably better for Chinese natives than American or Europeans.	I've really got no complaints about this hotel, but no real compliments either. The rooms were clean, but spare.The staff was nice, but not great with English.The location isn't really near anything except Beijing's pitiful zoo, but it's right across the street from that.The breakfast buffet was large, but I blame some warm milk for making me puke one day. There is one of those revolving restaurants on the top floor. Oct 10 2018	Seen better days avoid.	Try and avoid this hotel if you can, the room we had was very tired and the bathroom was a disgrace, they must use the whole output of the grouting industry in China to try keep the mould around the shower unit at bay and fail in the process. The room was very dark and the lighting is totally inadaquate. The staff were polite but instructions come from on high to keep service to a minimum and not all the advertised services are available. Probably very good in it's day but the cracks are showing with age, avoid. Oct 6 2018 	Beautiful hotel	This hotel is beautiful, comfortable and located in an interesting part of Beijing. We stayed here for three nights at the end of our trans siberian trip and could not have wished for a better end to our holiday. The room was lovely, bed extremely comfortable, the breakfast was amazing and restaurants varied with delicious food. The street where the hotel is located has numerous attractions: the zoo, planetarium and palaentology museum to name a few. I would highly recommend this hotel to fellow travellers. Sep 23 2018 	Adeqate 4 star hotel	Large hotel with decent rooms although quite dark and there were no bedside lights.There is an office where you can make reservations for one of the five restaurants and we went with our Chinese Guide to book ameal in the Grill (enough rice for now). We checked with the office later in the day to ensure the restaurant was open and that there were still tables and we were told it was OK.Had a shower and went to the grill to find a notice saying it was closed from late August until early October.I rang Reception to enquire about another of the restaurants and after speaking to three members of staff I was no wiser.Few staff seems to understand English.Revolving restaurant do do nice international (ish) buffet meals. Jun 10 2018	Excellent Beijing hotel	We had two short stays at this hotel. On both occasions the room was excellent with good facilities.The buffet breakfast has something for everyone but is not cheap at about 9GBP.The bar and restaurant staff were obliging as were the concierge staff.I would recommend this hotel without any hesitation. Feb 29 2018 	Old tired socialist hotel	this hotel has a deal with Chinese government offices. The hotel staff really did not care about their clients because they got deals from the coferences sponsored by the government anyway. They still hold that bad attitute in the 60's and 70's when sales assistants acted like your bosses. They lose guests' laundry quite often, or better they purposely hide guests' laundry with brand names, so they can sell it on the street later. The carpet is filthy. The faucets are rusty. The showhead is filled with soap scum. The maintainence of the hotel is horrible. You are still using the hair dryers with heavy klong TUBES in the 70's. I don't know how this hotel is ranked a five-star hotel. My assessment is only 2.5 stars at best. Xiyuan hotel is a typical product of the old Chinese iron bowl economy. This hotel needs a thorough overhaul. Oct 28 2017	good all round hotel	we recently stayed at the xiyuan hotel for 3 nights as part of an organised tour of china.we found this particular hotel perfectly adequate , the room was large as was the bathroom (2 showers). all the cosmetics provided you could possible need.i would not rate as a 5 star more like 4 but would happily stay there again.the breakfast was extensive and best of all we had on our journey in china. Oct 24 2017 	Good Solid Hotel	10/24/07 Just returned from staying at the Xiyuan Hotel. We were booked in one of the basic rooms, but since was on a smoking floor, moved to one of the basis suites on non-smoking floor. These are on the ends of the halls, so 2 outside walls (see below).Good, basic hotel. Although states is 5 Star, actually 4 Star in us system. Has a very good breakfast, included in most room charges, with a mix of western &amp; chinese fair. Pool &amp; exercise room appear to cost extra. Very few of the hotel staff speak english - the best seemed to be the operator who sets up wake up calls. A couple of surprises - no clocks in the room. The government does not allow heat to be turned on until Nov 15, except in the super-delux hotels. So it got a little cold in the room. The bed was very hard (like Eur beds) &amp; never really got used to it. Nice bathroom, 3-4 US TV stations. Good, very cheap (&lt;$2 / meal) chinese restaurant, that has an English menu, on Right just as leaving hotel property.If your tour includes Beijing Zoo, &amp; you also have free time, see if you can do something else during the tour. The Zoo is right across the highway from the hotel &amp; easy to do on your own. Internet cafe nearby was being renovated &amp; my ISP couldn't be accessed from hotel business center (2Y / min to use there I-net). The Carefore Grocery store has lots of stuff - AVOID going on the weekend. Every weekend is worse than the day before Thanksgiving in US.Enjoy. Oct 3 2017 	Great Hotel	Just finished a 30 day stay at the hotel for a work assignment so I have a good idea of the place. Service from staff was excellent and so quick whenever a request made. Language did not seem a barrier as staff patient and try to understand or would get assistance from staff that spoke English. Buffet breakfast was delicious with a large number of choices and eggs cooked to order. Big Carrefour store across street, european Walmart, everything u need can find there, also a Pizza Hut &amp; KFC across street if you want a quick break from Chinese. Hotel restaurants were plentiful with a great grill room almost top floor with great views and a delcious huge buffet on top floor in revolving restaurant. Food and service at restaurants I found to be very good. Good rates to and great value. A short taxi ride to financial center, walk to Beijing Zoo, 20-30 minute taxi ride to Tianemmen Square/Forbidden city, 40 minutes taxi to airport..(non peak times). A really comfortable place to stay! Jul 17 2017 	Won't come here again!	We stayed in the smaller Xiyuan Villas, which are cheaper rooms and not in the same building as the main hotel. First the good: the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, something that's not that easy to find with midprice hotels in China. The Villa restaurant is very reasonably priced (US$ 5 per dish) and quite delicious (but skip the breakfast). The location is so-so. Surrounded by busy highways, but within walking distance of the zoo, a couple pizza places, and an internet cafe. You might also want to check out the Purple Bamboo Park (Zizhuyuan) if you are around early in the morning or in the late afternoon. In July the lotus flowers are absolutely gorgeous, and it's full of people strolling, singing, and practicing martial arts. Unfortunately the reception staff, both at the Xiyuan main building and at the Villa, were bewilderingly nasty. Enough so that I wouldn't come back. Also, the location, being set back from the streets, makes the rooms very quiet at night; but in the morning when other guests and housekeeping staff start yelling down the halls, it gets noisy! Sep 20 2006 	A Truly Dreadful Experience	I had the good fortune to attend a business trip to China and must say I had a wonderful time staying in some really nice hotels in Xiamen, Shenzhen and other cities. However, I have nothing positive to say about the Hotel Xiyuan. The first room offered was filthy, grey net curtains, damp on the walls and smelt of smoke. The second room offered was little better. After agreeing to pay an upgrade we moved to a better room and thought things would improve. We had to argue with staff, yes argue, to put anything on the hotel bill, despite them swiping the credit card in advance! They changed our restaurant dining venue without consultation making us go without breakfast or be late for a scheduled business meeting. Never responded to a complaint and were thoroughly inefficient The bill was wrong at check out and they forgot to collect our luggage from the room. Needless to say we will not be returning or recommending to anyone. If you do go - and enjoy - as previous guests appear to have done - please let me know your secret! Jul 14 2006 	Completely comfortable	Everything about this hotel was great. Comfortable rooms. great breakfast, helpful staff. May 30 2006	Excellent	Excellent Hotel. Nice Rooms, spotlessly clean. Well equipped. 1st class breakfast.Only criticism was distance from centre. Neverthelass an enjoyable stay. Jan 7 2006 	Good Food and location	Stayed at the hotel as part of an international conference in November. The range of food was good at reasonable prices, including their &quot;food street&quot; in a nearby building. Service was good. The cheaper room I had was a little &quot;tired&quot;, shaver point not working, room could do with a repaint. This was evident in other parts of the hotel that perhaps it had seen better days.I would strongly suggest paying by other than credit card as many of us who attended the conference had trouble with unauthorised transactions and had to get our cards replaced. Several conference attendees only used their credit card at this hotel whilst visiting China. Sep 29 2005	A nice hotel	Stayed at the Xiyuan Hotel in August 2005 as part of a tour we were doing of China - found the hotel clean, staff friendly and breakfast was good. Hotel was abit out of the city centre - could have done with being abit closer to the action, but on the whole a good hotel. Mar 20 2005 	The Xiyuan's a Real Find!	We have stayed twice at the Xiyuan Hotel in Beijing. It's about a 20 minute cab ride to the center of town, but we never paid more than $5. The staff speaks English and is very accomodating and friendly. The rooms are standard, not luxe, but very clean. We easily added an extra bed for our granddaughter and had adequate space. Bottled water is free, and broadband is available at a minimal cost. The breakfast buffet is outstanding, and there are several restaurants in the building and within walking distance. A Spa had been added by our 10/04 visit, with very reasonably priced services. The only drawback is its distance from the city center, although tour buses will pick you up -- and it's much quieter! We highly recommend the Xiyuan Hotel."
"Oct 14 2021 	Pretty good for a cheap place to stay	Stayed 4 nights in &quot;building 2&quot;. Room simple but cheap, clean and adequate - bed, desk, chair, internet, shower / toilet. Not fancy but that doesn't bother me. Only surprise was the cleaner coming in at 8.30am (she did knock first!) - use the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign if you want to sleep in. Front desk pretty good and spoke adequate English. Easy to miss if you don't know where it is - down a sidestreet. Didn't really investigate the neighbourhood or hotel's other facilities.Convenient for Tsinghua (about 20 minutes' walk to East gate). WuDaoKou subway station about 10 minutes' walk - can get to airport express quite easily (but takes a while along line 13) and also into town. There is an airport bus that can drop you nearby if you know where to get off, but I wouldn't fancy that unless I was sure! Jul 13 2021	Comfortable stay professional assistance at Xi Jiao Beijing	Reliable personnel, relaxing and quiet environment, all taxis in Beijing know this hotel. Although it is not in a central position, I still recommend it for the clean rooms and prices that are attractive compared with service and quality provided. Jul 28 2018 	Missing something	I stayed there for a couple of days on my business trip. The hotel is placed near universities sites. The location of the hotel is hidden from the main street. The hotel accommodates several buildings. My room was located in a building next to the main building. In the building where I was placed the breakfast wasn't served every morning so I had to walk in cold freezing morning of December to the main building to have my breakfast.Internet was OK. Only one English TV channel. Apr 1 2018 	Quite good actually	After one week's terrible experiences at Novotel Peace in Beijing(I left a review), I moved to this relatively unknown hotel. I did not have much expectation when I booked this hotel. But, I had very few choices since I have so many businesses at Peking University, Qinghua and Wangjing(connected through convenient line 13 subway). For about $120, I could get a delux room in building number 9 - the hotel has many buildings and this building has four-star rate while others are three star rate. After I checked in, I found that my room is a little bit smelly and asked a different room. The front desk immediately assigned me a new room which is about 30% bigger than the original one. Though it does not have nice view or ultra-modern features, the room was clean and well maintained. Overall, I think this hotel is better than the current ranking (#143 in Beijing). Cleaners, front desks and other staffs are extremely kind and nice. One day, an assistant manager just came by with some fruits in the afternoon to ask if I needed anything. When I went out for late morning meeting, a cleaning staff moved in to clean. He called me in the hallway, alarming me that I left my cellphone in the room. Another day, I had an afternoon nap and went out for dinner. When I came back, I found that they briefly made the bed again and briefly cleaned the room one more time(they did it in the morning already). Bathroom is adequate and glass desk is decent to use. The room has many storage spaces and offers free green tea (real one), instant coffee, black/jasmine teabags. The area is not for a tourist. But it is a place for international students (many colleges are located around there), it has many cheap but interesting dining options, mainly Korean and Japanese. Inside of the hotel, it has several very reasonably priced Korean/Japanese/Izakaya restaurant and a bar. It has a few shortcomings though. If you are intolerant to smoking smell, this hotel is not very good. You can smell cigarette smoke in the hallways. Breakfast (free for delux room guests) is somewhat miserable. All staffs are extremely nice but their English is very limited. If you cannot speak any Chinese, this is not a good place to stay. I believe this hotel will be a pretty decent option in near future. I am familiar with this hotel's change (though this is the first time staying here). When I came for dinner a couple of years ago, inside of the hotel was quite chaotic, including some men distributing advertisement of &quot;special massage&quot; and hostess bar in one of the hotel buildings. This time, I found that the hotel &quot;sanitized&quot; those elements. I would be comfortable to bring my family here now (except for too much cigarette smell). If they keep working, I think this hotel will be my preferred place around Zhongguancun area. Nov 7 2017 	fine hotel pity about the neighbourhood	I had a deluxe room which was huge and quite cheap (I booked through a conference organiser). The staff were very helpful and friendly. There are several restaurants in the hotel but most closed around 8.30pm which is not helpful if you're returning from the theatre or evening out. The only one that stayed open later was above the pool/gym; this is essentially for staff and is pretty basic but is clean, open to the public and the food is excellent and cheap. No English is spoken but you can point to a picture on the menu. The one problem is that this hotel is in the 'burbs' a long way from central Beijing. The neighbourhood is deeply uninteresting altho quite safe with plenty of people around (this is China after all). The streets around are pretty rundown, choked with traffic and a pleasant evening stroll is out of the question. However, taxis are very cheap and there is an (even cheaper) subway station not too far away. Note: if you sleep with your window open you'll get bitten. Get some industrial strength insecticide from the staff (no I don't know the Cantonese word for it). Jun 17 2016 	clean nice cold in October	Nice, a lot of restaraunts and other services inside.Clean rooms and halls, friendly staff.In october there was pretty cold ( 10C - 15C ), but heating was not working, becasue of &quot;official&quot; autum did not begin yet.So me and my fiancee had to buy electrical heater for the room, in one of the big stores. Donated it to the hotels when check-out, you can ask for it :)Very friendly staff, always try to help but only few ofthem speals English.At the entrance you can find a few cards and coupons that helps you navigate in the city ( tranlated phrases and places to visit written in Chinese and English ).Each building have two or more restaraunts, cafees, etc.Remember that most of the places in Beijing closes at 6:00pm ( or earlies ) so little pub in the hotel was nice place to have a drink, to chat with othere tourists.Try theis beers, it's a little strange but tasty and the price is really low.TV in Chinese, of course, but there was a lot of english speaking people ( hotel hosts a lot of conventions, seminars and such ).I was there for academic seminar, and met with few local students also.They told me that hotel's area is not all that safe at night, but at day light it's Ok.Nevertheless i had a walk or two near the hotel at 10:00pm. It looks like ussual not-top-of-the-class suburbuns. Small houses, students, etc.There ALWAYS were taxi ready at the hotel entrance, hotel's staff menage the taxi really good.If you find yourself at evening in the hotel, you can play bowling or, better, go to visit one of the kung-fu shows. I visited RED THEATRE ( or someting like it ), if was magnificient. IT's alsow starts at 8:000pm or 9:00pm, so it give you something to do in Beijings evening. Aug 31 2021 	????? Jan 18 2021 	bon hotel"
"Jun 29 2017 	Great little hotel in Haidan (University District)	I was booked into this hotel by Chinese friends at Beijing Jiatong University at the last minute...but couldn't have asked for a better hotel. For just over 20 GBP per night I had a little haven which I looked forward to returning to each night. Chic and stylish rooms - a lot of thought had gone into a good-looking, functional design with money spent where it mattered. Comfortable beds, crisp white sheets and a wonderful bathroom with huge walk-in shower (no bath). Also a choice of aromatherapy and anti-allergen pillows as well as fluffy white bathrobes and ‘take-away’ soft slippers.It was not a room with a view as windows set quite high in wall. I had reservations when the receptionist explained this to me as I like light and space, but once I saw the room I knew it wouldn't be a problem. The windows were attractively screened and the relative shade kept things cool (no need to use the excellent air-con). No mini-bar but range of snacks and soft drinks available in room and drinking water provided on-tap in the bathroom. Satellite TV included CNN, sports and CCTV 9 amongst the Hong Kong and Chinese stations. Don't usually have breakfast in hotels so didn't try the buffet breakfast, but at only 28RMB it was cheaper than a coffee in Starbucks! Guests were mostly Chinese conference attendees but I did see other Western guests most days. This is primarily a business hotel with a business centre, Wi-Fi access etc but as a tourist I found the staff helpful and welcoming and I would happily stay here again. There is a reasonably large supermarket just across the road from the hotel and a huge market round the corner selling almost everything including the kitchen sink! Local restaurants mainly catered for students and not much English was spoken but most seemed to have picture menus which helped a lot.I commuted into central Beijing most days which took about 30 minutes and felt quite safe returning to the hotel later in the evening (around 10 -11.00). The hotel is a 5-minute taxi ride / 7-8 minute bus ride to the nearest Underground station which is XiZhiMen."
"May 4 2021 	Beautiful Setting Quiet Convenient Location.... Nice.	When our driver [the owner of the company we were here to visit] pulled in the front gate, he asked us to please wait in the car so he could make sure we were in the right place... I picked out the hotel several weeks before, so I knew what to expect, but, the place was a surprise to my local escort... Turns out that he had a hard time believing that such a beautiful place was actually a hotel.! The location is easy to reach by car or Metro line 1, just off HengShan Road about 200 yards from the HengShan Road Metro station. If you're not familiar, this area of Shanghai is what I would call &quot;inner city residential&quot;. Mostly residences [lots of ex-pats] with many local restaurants and bars... Four Metro stops [about 10 minutes, cost RMB 3 each way] from city-center [People's Square/Nanjing Rd].I picked this hotel from recommendations here and I'd say the previous reviewers were spot-on... The hotel grounds are beautiful, the hotel is older, but well-maintained. Overall, it's a very nice place and for a very reasonable [for inner city Shanghai] price.The rooms are a good size and 4-star quality [see photos]. Furnishings are a bit dated but spotlessly clean. The bathrooms are 4.5-star with updated granite and all the usual amenities. The bed was firm, but, not as hard as others I've slept on in China. The pillows were plentiful, large and just right. In-room safe, decent TV, free internet and small mini-bar complete the picture. There is a balcony that is shared between two rooms, so, the balconies were all locked for security. You could not go out on the balcony at all.. A small disappointment, but, I was glad the hotel was safety-conscious. There was a small breakfast buffet with most of the usual Chinese and Western breakfast foods... It was ok... not great, not bad... Coffee was pretty good...I suppose my only small complaints were... 1.The front desk staff was a bit dour. No smiles at all, but, very efficient service... and.. 2. The electrical outlets were a bit old/loose.. You had to jiggle wires a bit to get things like laptop and phone chargers to stay powered... Minor inconveniences... I would definitely stay here again. Aug 12 2016	Peaceful and comfortable four star hotel	The Anting Villa is a very good hotel, set amid well kept gardens on a quiet road in a leafy suburb of Shanghai. My room was comfortable, modern, and very well equipped; a comfortable bed, easy chair and footstool, and a bathroom with full bath and plenty of space for toiletries. The room not only had a sizeable desk, but also came with unlimited high speed internet access included in the room price. My room even came with a computer which I assume worked with the large flat screen television (I used my own laptop, so I’m not sure exactly how the computer worked.)My impression is that this is a hotel primarily for business people rather than tourists. It is in the Xuhui Zone of Shangha, an area which as far as I could tell contains little that would be of interest to most leisure travelers. The hotel is a 20 minute taxi ride (costing 25 yuan, or about US$3) from the Bund area, and it is a short walk away from an underground train station. The hotel does not have a tour desk. It has three restaurants, serving Chinese and foreign food, and all three them are perfectly adequate though unspectacular. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and competent; not all spoke English, but those who didn’t were quick to find someone who could help this foreigner who speaks no Chinese.All in all, this is a very good, peaceful, and modern hotel, with a competent and attentive staff. I enjoyed my three day stay and I wouldn’t hesitate to come back. But if you are looking for a hotel with easy access to tourist attractions, in room massages, karaoke, or plentiful tourist information, this probably isn’t the place for you."
"Jun 3 2021 	Beautiful Place	I stayed at Ascott for nearly 2 months! That is a long time to actually know the hotel staff by name - and trust me, the staff was genuinely very nice. I was undergoing training in Pudong and Ascott is one of the best places you can stay. With a nice view overlooking the river, Ascott offers all the luxuries that one can expect only from 4/5 start. One gets a good variety in food, though not so much for a vegetarian. Pool and Gym facilities are excellent. May 31 2021 	Spacious clean and good value for Shanghai	Myself and some colleagues stayed at the Ascott for a week to attend a conference, having chosen the Ascott as being within reasonable walking distance of the (very expensive) hotels where the conference was taking place. The Ascott's accommodation is more geared to the long-stay traveller, but we were more than happy with the huge apartment-style accommodation. The one-bedroom suite was very spacious, with a bedroom, living/dining room with office space, separate galley kitchen, large bathroom and even a dressing room. It was also spotlessly clean, the maid came in every day and each day left two bottles of mineral water. There was a good array of complimentary toiletries and a large number of complimentary sachets of tea, coffee, green tea, creamer etc. Its easy to buy milk and other drinks from the small shop round the corner, as there was no mini bar. The only downside as far as I was concerned was that since the hotel caters more for long-stay guests, there are not really the facilities for refreshments that one would find in a regular hotel. There was no bar/cafe on site, only a room where the complimentary breakfast was taken, but this shut after breakfast time. As to the breakfast, this is best avoided as it is very poor. Go somewhere else for a better breakfast. Given that the Ascott itself is immaculate and very clean, I was surprised to find that the tables on which the breakfast was laid out were very unsavoury looking and seemed unclean, especially around the tea/coffee are. There was a lot of Chinese food available, but very little in the way of a Western breakfast, some sliced bread next to a very dirty toaster, some small dry rolls, and some jam and butter and yoghurt but that was about it. There were bacon and beans and some small omlettes but the bacon did not look right and most of the food was very unappetising. There were numerous staff at every breakfast, but their time might have been better spent cleaning the breakfast area rather than just hovering, chatting and getting in the way of the guests. Reception staff were quite helpful and organised a nice car from and to the airport at a cost of RMB 600 one way. The Pudong international airport is about 45 mins drive, locally one can take taxis at a very reasonable cost - the hotel will get one quite promptly -but bear in mind Chinese taxi drivers mostly do not speak English and also the Ascott is tucked away down a side road, so best show them the address of the hotel in Chinese and tell them it is near Marine Tower. Many taxi drivers do not know where the Ascott is, and also surprisingly they do not know many of the main landmarks in Shanghai. If they throw a wobbly, just get out of the taxi and get another one who knows where he is going. Overall, lovely accommodation, but be prepared to either cater for yourself in the kitchen, which has plentiful amenities, or go out to eat. Also, they do not exchange currency at this hotel, so you have to go to a bank or other exchange office. A final word of warning - it is difficult to get to anywhere walking at the moment in Shanghai due to the massive amount of building work taking place ahead of Expo 2020, which will take place summer 2020. You think you can walk somewhere, only to find your path blocked by a massive building site, and you have a 20 minute detour to skirt round it. The beautiful bund is also marred by huge amounts of building work at the time of writing. The whole of Pudong is awash with construction workers in orange hard hats. Feb 18 2018 	Great place for long stays	I stayed at the Ascott on three separate occasions in the span of two years. I had a great stay each time. The one bedrooms are pretty roomy and the bathrooms are large. There is a fitness center with an indoor pool and tennis/badminton court. We rented the courts a couple of times. They are fairly well kept.There is a little minimart on the first floor in case need something quickly. Otherwise, it is pretty expensive.The only thing that needed improvement was the menu in the restaurant. It was pretty tiring to eat the same thing all of the time. However, there is a free shuttle that will take you to a large mall a couple of minutes away. This mall also has a supermarket. The only thing is that it will not pick you up, so you'll have to get a taxi back. Oct 17 2017 	Highly recommend the Ascott	My husband and I, as well as our 10 year old son and nanny, stayed at the Ascott for 18 nights, while we participated at a conference at the nearby convention center. I personally never left the Pudong side of the river, so can't speak to how convenient the Ascott would be for that purpose. For getting to the International new convention center (attached to the oriental riverside hotel), it was about a 20 minute walk, which was a couple of blocks from the SuperBrand mall. The Ascott has a shuttle which goes there several times a day (they even took us directly to the convention center when we asked). Taxis were always easy to come by from the hotel, though we were not usually leaving during rush hour. The taxi ride was fast and cheap.We had both a one bedroom apartment and a two bedroom apartment. I had read in a couple of reviews that things were getting old in the apartments, but that was not the case at all for us. Everything was clean, and in new or nearly new condition. We were told when we arrived that we'd been upgraded to &quot;executive&quot; apartments, so perhaps that made the difference. The housekeeping service was excellent, and the staff always friendly and eager to please. At the front desk there was always someone who spoke English quite well, and they were able to make sure our taxi drivers knew where we were headed. As other reviewers have said, it is difficult to find the Ascott, but most drivers were able to at least come close with the directions we had written in Chinese, and we could usually get the rest of the way by pointing. Only once did I have to get out of a taxi and find a new one because the driver had no idea - didn't read any language I think.I was not crazy about the breakfast, but there were a lot of choices if you don't mind eating things that westerners don't normally consider &quot;breakfast food&quot; I stuck mostly to the hard-boiled eggs and pastries. There was fresh fruit every day - usually watermelon and either cantelope or orange segments.As far as the beds being hard, in our apartments they were firm but quite comfortable. The comforters were very nice. The water pressure was fine in the showers, though I did try to remember to turn the water on several minutes before hand as it took that long to warm up.I used the combination washer/dryer frequently. It was very slow - took several hours to wash and dry a small load, but things did come out okay (somewhat more wrinkled than at home, but there was an iron and ironing board).The internet service was great. We had a problem with our modem the first couple of days, but it was replaced and we had no problems after that. I had thought there would be some websites I couldn't get onto in China, but I was able to do everything I wanted, and quickly.The food from room service was not fantastic, but was fast cheap, and adequate. The small market onsite was useful for getting a few items, but if you are going to actually be cooking you'll need to go to the SuperCenter at the mall. Limited dishes and cookware are provided, but a lot more is kept in a locked cabinet in the kitchen, which they opened for us on request in one of our apartments.The fitness center was kept cool and comfortable and while there was only one elliptical, which is what I like to use, there was never anyone else there when I went. My son played tons of table tennis - the charge for using the table was low (less than $3 per hour), but we paid more than that to rent the paddles each time, so I suggest you bring your own if you'll be playing a lot. We'd planned to play tennis, but the indoor court was not air-conditioned and was just to hot for us. My son enjoyed kicking a ball around the soccer field (with goals),and the outdoor playground looked cute for younger kids.Hope this helps. I highly recommend the Ascott for luxurious serviced apartment accomodations, especially if you have business in that area. Aug 14 2017 	Ascott is a comfortable apartment-like stay	I stayed at the Ascott Pudong Shanghai for 2 months from June to August 2017. Here are my thoughts. I had a two-bedroom apartment on a high floor. I appreciated the balconies (3 of them), as I could let in fresh air and enjoy watching the rain. I wish the housekeeping personnel would clean the balconies, though, as they were quite dirty (from the dirt in the air) and I tracked a lot of it into the apartment (on the white carpeting) when I walked in and out. It is true that the Ascott is not as new as it once was, but it is a very nice place. The apartment was spacious and there was substantial closet space. I wish I had so much in my house back in the states!The master bath was wonderful. I appreciated the adjustable shower (as I am only 5 foot 3 inches), so that I could reach the shower head. The bathtub came in handy, as well. The second bathroom was adequate (what I usually get in most hotels) and my son enjoyed having his own bathroom when he visited me. The bedrooms are very nice. The blackout curtains don't quite black everything out, but they do an admirable job. The beds are a little hard (okay, pretty hard) and take some getting used to especially for us who are used to more cushioning. The alarm clock never quite worked, so I used the wake up system on the phone. It never failed me!I asked for a DVD player my 3rd week there and wish I had asked earlier (or that they had told me one was available). It made things a little easier when I couldn't sleep at night. The kitchen was workable and I appreciated having all the utensils, pots and pans there for me. I could concentrate on cooking, not on buying cookware, so that was nice. The common areas of the hotel are very nice--marble and such. An understated elegance that I do appreciate. The little store on site is a bit pricy, but nothing like the prices at other local hotels, and I did appreciate that (for instance, you can get a 12 oz can of soda on the street for 2 RMB, in the Ascott store it was 3 RMB, but in another hotel nearby (which shall remain nameless), my colleages were asked to pay 20 RMB). The clubhouse is very nice and the workout room and pool (and jacuzzi) never appear too busy. I always found room when I showed up. I do wish the front desk clerk at the clubhouse didn't sneak off for a smoke in the office nearby--we can still smell it in the lobby!The grounds are beautifully manicured. There are walking paths, a soccer field, a small playground, trees, tables and chairs, and a see-saw. The Ascott also has a shuttle service that leaves at pre-designated times to local shopping malls and tourist locations. I only used it twice, but it was nice to know that I didn't always have to pay for a taxi to get where I wanted to go. The breakfast is not on par with the buffet at the Intercontinental or even the breakfast offered at the Sofitel in town, but it is palatable. It has a variety of foods: eggs, congee, mashed potatoes, dumplings, fresh fruit, juices, coffee and hot chocolate, breads... and it can get a bit monotonous, but it fills me up. The room service menu is a bit dicey, too. I ordered the jumbo burger and was served soemthing that looked nothing like jumbo (it was two small patties) and very little like a burger (I'm not sure it was meat--it may have been soy). But other items like the Spaghetti Bolognaise was wonderful. Besides, I tended to use Sherpa or other delivery services if I didn't feel like cooking. I appreciated the staff most of all. They were very helpful. There was a little miscommunication at first regarding the inventory of items in my apartment, but we worked through that very quickly. The staff took pains to remember my name and which apartment I was in. They always worked hard to fulfill any request I made. Jessica Fang is an outstanding front desk manager. She even took it upon herself to start up a class for guests to learn useful Mandarin and taught it herself. It was nice to learn some Mandarin and also meet fellow guests. All in all, the Ascott was a good address to have for the two months I spent in Shanghai. I would recommend it for longer-term stays. Jul 14 2017	Pros and Cons	The room provides you every thing you need, but things are getting old here. The carpet is kind of stained and dusty that I can feel it on my feet. The living room are spacy...the kitchen is nice but I never use it. The walk-in closet &quot;look&quot; nice but &quot;smell&quot; terrible like a few pair of damp shoes were there before. The bath room is not as functional and is designed for 7-feet tall people. In the morning 9 a.m. the maid got into my bedroom (well, she had to pass my living room, kitchen and there was another door to the bed room) and I was shocked. She saw me asleep and yet she asked (well...people here are loud by nature) if I want to have the room cleaned (!?) The breakfast is terrible, I could only eat the soy milk. Coffee sucks, it was from dripping machine. Bread and pastries are limited. Street buns and dumplings taste better, I belive. Apr 10 2017 	My kids love this hotel!	We went there on oct 26 2006. It was a large apartment with two bedrooms. There are three televisions and a big kitchen. There even have a garden with a small children playground. Everything are nice and we enjoy our stay. This is a very good choice for family with kids. Jul 13 2005	Luxury service apartment in Shanghai	Our family of 4 stayed for 2 nights at The Ascott Pudong. We had an apartment with 2 bedrooms (1 king, 2 twins) and 2 bath (2 tubs, 1 shower). We were pleased with how well appointed the rooms were. From the living room, there was a view across the Huangpo river, although not exactly of the Bund. The kids were excited to find that not only was there cable TV, but also a DVD player and VCD player (with all those gadgets why go sightseeing?). The kitchen was small and sparsely equipped, but enough material was at hand to make simple meals. There was a clothes washer and the appliances were clean and looked quite new.The hotel provides a shuttle service to a few of the more popular destinations, such as People's Square and that big shopping center in Pudong whose name I can't remember. The shuttle service is one way, however. No shuttle to the airport. Breakfast was the usual mixed Chinese and Western fare, although, surprisingly, with less variety than we had seen in our 2 weeks of journeying through China. A small point - although our apartment was clearly set up for 4 people, they would only give us breakfast tickets for 2.Finally, one of the drawbacks of the hotel is its location in the financial center of Pudong - somewhat removed from the cultural and historical center of Shanghai. In the 3 trips back to the hotel by taxi over 2 days, we could never get any of the 3 taxi drivers to figure out exactly where the hotel was. Although its address is Pudong Avenue, it is actually tucked behind a set of tall buildings so that its front entrance is not visible from the street. On the plus side, the taxi fare is low - about 17-22 RMB (US$2 to 3) from the city center - and it's about a 10 minute walk from the subway."
"Oct 29 2018 	Good Location Excellent Value with Minor Problems	One of my husband's officemates recommended this hotel and I didn't have any regrets booking at this hotel. First of all, we paid for RMB1,074.00 for 4 days and 3 nights. Quite inexpensive right? That also includes one buffet breakfast for each day. Since I was with my mother the whole stay, I just had to pay for RMB20 for another buffet breakfast. Check-in and check-out was fast though I was requested to press my atm pincode because it was offline. So I had to go to nearest ATM machine to check if my balance is still correct after the transaction. The minute we walked inside the room, I was surprised that the room was bigger than what I expected. It smelled like cigarette smoke so I called the reception for my complaint. After a whole day of city tour the next day, the smell was no longer there. Thank goodness! The sheets were clean, well pressed and no stains. They provided double window panes to prevent dust to come in because there is a big building construction just across the hotel. Bailemen is next to a bustling train station and also the famous Jingan Temple. We went to most of the places by train so it is very convenient. The food during breakfast had so many Chinese varieties. I hope there will be more Western as well. The coffee in the dispenser is strong so don't forget to add hot water. But for those who want to energize, it is perfect for you. Aug 13 2018 	Great location. Not too western crowd...	I recently (August 2018) had just one night to spend in Shanghai on my way back to Europe from Nanking. I had to choose: stay an hour out of town for about 250 rmb, or closer to town, for more. Sometimes much more. This was a perfect compromise. It is located just next to a beautiful, lively Buddhist temple (Jing An Ci), it is clean and about 50 m from the No. 2 subway line, which goes downtown and connects nicely with the Mag Lev to the airport. The clientele was mainly Chinese, all very nice, and the staff were fine, patient and spoke English well. The room was clean and well appointed. I would happily go back. Apr 27 2018 	good clean and convenient	Bailemen hotel is conveniently located across the subway station in shagnhai, You can hop on the quick and easy subway to many parts of the city within minutes.The hotel room is clean and roomy, and includes a good variety breakfast for one person.There is a 24 hrs mcdonald next to the hotel, plus many restaurants and shops within a few blocks. Apr 21 2018 	Good Location and nice breakfast	The hotel was classified as a 3* hotel and we pay less than S$500 for 4night. Location near the Jingan Temple, about 5min walk from the Metro.The room maid is helpful,my hubby step on a broken glass inside the room, and immediately the room maid got a vaccum to clean the whole carpet again. Taxi is very easy to get and it will bring you anywhere. Check in/out was fast. Breakfast comes in western and local delight, not too bad, quite a variety. The famous Jingan temple is just next door and if you don't mind the walking, you can choose to walk down to the Nanjing walking street and to the Bund, don't forget to bring along the camera you will find lots of nice scenery along the way. Of course, Taxi is cheap so can always hail one and happy riding! Apr 13 2018 	Good Value Hotel	We stayed there for 3D/2N. The hotel was 1 to 2hr drive (depending on the traffic) from the new terminal 3 airport. 5-10 min walk to the subway. 5-10 walk to a mall and burger king. The bed was not that soft though. We had a deluxe room. It was big. No english channels e.g. CNN, BBC, HBO, etc. The Chinese buffet breakfast was ok. Didn't speak that much with the reception so I had no problem communicating with them. Money exchange rate at the hotel was good.Near a good bar/restaurant called the Spot which has some bands playing. Also near to an Irish pub. Apr 11 2018 	For budget travellers	The location almost on top of metro station is good. The traffic on the streets are quite hard, continueing all thru the night. View is guite good, at least if your room is by the street.The staff does not speak very good English, but you can manage.Breakfast is not very good. Only few &quot;western&quot; items available. Tea is from teabags, but if you like strong coffee, you really enjoy the breakfast.Internet connection is quite expensive if you consider the price of the room, 40RMB per day.All in all, quite cheap, quite clean, quite ok. Just don't expect five star luxury and service. Mar 24 2018 	Great Location - but nothing else	We booked this hotel based on the reviews on TA, agree that the location is great. However had not realised that a 3* hotel in China does not measure up to those in Europe and felt that the place was dingy, the food was awful and instead of staying the 3 nights booked we checked out after 1 night. Perhaps I was put off by the fact that condoms were on sale in the en-suite, must say that was a first for me. On the whole our other hotels in both Beijing and Xi'an were great but both were 4* and all were from this site. Nov 24 2017 	Great Location	Excellent location for a hotel in Shanghai, as recommended by ELLYSE. Subway stop literally on the corner. Bookstores, food shops around the block. Near the hotel, a 24 hour convenience store + a McDonalds + a Shanghai restaurant was still open when we arrived at 1am. Rooms were ok, clean enough. But the location is everything in this case. Airport shuttle buses from both hongqiao and pudong have stops here. We paid only 19 rmb and 4rmb from both airports one way using the shuttle bus.Will consider this next time we stay in Shanghai. Oct 29 2017	Review	Location is great as there is a train station call jing an stn nearby. there is also a tourist information center just opposite the street of the hotel , the room was big , ( ours were the normal two bed ) and thus plenty of space to throw things around , there is even a safe depost in each room but you could also opt to put your valuables at the lobby .. there are shops nearby to the hotel and food is not a problem in fact the food there is consider cheap and we spend most of the money on food Dislike The food at the hotel was not that good , we took our breakfast at the hotel and after two days , we could not endure it and thus went out to eat the lobby service SUCKS big time , don't expect any smile or greetings from them. on the whole it was not bad if the service was good , then this hotel would get a better rating. Oct 3 2017	amaizng location	Stayed here for 5 nights. its a great location at a great price. between 40-50 US$.Rooms are huge, bigger than the JC Mandarin where I stayed before and payed about 120US$ a night.Excellent location with the Jignan temple right there and the Jignan tube station. full of restaurants, bars and shopping malls,.very accessible and even if you have forgotten your hotel address card, all you need to say is Jignan temple and you will be back here.On the flip side they hardly speak English so ordering anything is a bit cumbersome,but all in all the best value you can get and great location Apr 12 2017 	Perfect location great value hotel	We just returned from a trip to Shanghai and stayed at the Bailemen for 4 nights. The staff were professional and willing to help at any hour. The location is spectacular for those who love a neighborhood feel. The Jianan Temple is across the street and the Jianan Park is also across the street. The hotel windows overlook the beautiful park where one can see the locals getting their morning exercise at dawn.Cheap yet trendy restaurants are all within one to two blocks and Nanjing Road- the artery of Shanghai's commercial and shopping district starts at the Bailemen and ends at the Bund. The few kilometers of walking helps one truly appreciate the upper end of Shanghai life.The rates for walk-ins is cheaper than what we paid. A triple room was advertised on the &quot;discount&quot; board for under $45. The exchange rate for currency was the same as banks and very convenient.Rooms are simple but comfortable. The breakfast is Chinese in general but does include toast, sweet rolls and eggs. My 9 year old did love eating the noodles and fried chicken as well as the abundant fresh fruit for breakfast which were part of the Chinese breakfast.The store next door is a nice grocery and convenience eatery where we picked up bottled water every day for about 20 cents a bottle.If you are looking for a clean, well-run hotel with good service and value for your money, you won't be disappointed. Dec 3 2005	Tired Three Star	Stayed at this hotel for three nights. It is rated three star according to the local system and you can expect a level of service and appointment no more than this. Patronised mainly by Chinese are far as we could tell. We found it to be a bit tired with decore in need of refurbishment. The bed was very hard, the TV channels were all in Chinese except one in English and no BBC or CNN. The breakfast, which was included in our room rate, was a Chinese buffet and some of the dishes might not suit Western tastes. Bread, jam, butter, omlette and soft drinks were all Westerners might find suitable for breakfast although dumplings and noodles were also available. Coffee was of a quality Westerners might not find acceptable. On the positive side it was very handily located on West Najing Road. A subway station was across the road as was a Japanese department store with food hall, supermarket, pharmacy, cafes and pizza restaurants. Oct 15 2018 	????????"
"Nov 9 2021 	Excellent value no frills!	Location of hotel is quite good for crossing over by taxi to Puxi or going to Lujiajui. Unfortunately, its ambience and accessibility is somewhat spoilt by ongoing Metro construction work on Pudong Avenue. Neighbourhood is a little dusty but not unduly noisy. Room offers good size and comfort, without any unnecessary features or over-intrusive service. Another plus is the convenience of dining at the 2 wonderful Chinese restaurants on either side of the Pudong Avenue entrance. One is a popular Sichuan restaurant; the other a newly opened &quot;Fusion&quot; place featuring interesting dishes like Foie Gras done Chinese-style and Prime Mutton sourced from Hainan. Feb 18 2021 	Good Value for the room	The room was good. It was large with a nice sitting area. Our room came with a kitchen that was good size for a hotel room. This made it very nice for us to store food we purchased at the store. The shower was very nice, but a little small for our personal taste. The bathroom needs more lighting. The walls in the bedroom were dirty, but the rest of the area was clean. I would stay at this hotel again, because the price was such a good value. Oct 16 2018 	Nice place	I stay here whenever I come to Shanghai. It is close to our company's Shanghai office. The employees at the front desk can speak English (minimal though). The rooms are spacious and clean with a mini fridge that has water/coke/juice. The restaurant on the second floor serves breakfast with some westernized items. Although I thought that the french fries were a little weird for breakfast! They have a really nice selection of fruit, I made the mistake of loading up on it only to find out that it tasted salty (not sure why).They also have 4 or 5 English channels on their tv's which is nice.I would definitely recommend this hotel.The only thing I don't like is that most taxi drivers are not familiar with it so make sure you have the address in Chinese. Mar 21 2018	Decent place	I stayed at the The Barony during a round trip in China. The booking was done by the chinese agency, so I can’t comment on the room rates.First I was a bit worried because I know Shanghai from former visits, though the hotel name was new to me. When I saw the tiny lobby, I got some more reservation and the english language skills of the front desk officers seemed to be minimal.On the other hand, the rooms are fairly big and very clean, also the bathroom. The view to Pudong is great. The door gives an alarm if not properly locked. Breakfast buffet was quite good, I think I had the best croissants all over China in that hotel. On those 4 days, I also had dinner in the restaurant at the last day. To order it took a while due to language barriers, but the restaurant staff was being very helpful and eager to feel us comfortable ... a kind of charming trouble, I don’t mind. By the way, the chinese meal was good value and quality.There’s another restaurant with a nice ambiance and decoration in the same building but with separate entrance from the road. The Metro station is just 5mins walk though you need to change trains if you’re heading for Nanjing or Huaihai Road.Get a business card with the hotels address, because taxi drivers are not familiar with the hotel. Sep 14 2017 	One night only	We only stayed one night at the Barony hotel because the Purple Mountain was fully booked. It is a very modern hotel. We would stay there again for one night only.The rooms were fairly large,clean and the bed very comfortable.The breakfast was not to my liking, cold fried eggs or Congee ( rice porridge) I just ate the fruit which was ok. Apr 11 2021 	Une chambre? non ! Un appartement avec vue magnifique sur Pudong"
"Oct 22 2021	Good Value Hotel but ...	We just returned from Shanghai and our stay at the BestWestern Ruite.We agree with previous reviews that the hotel is a bit out of the way, and there is no eateries near by except for the restaurant within the hotel itself. Having said that, the new subway line (only a block away) is now open. This made it very easy to get to other parts of Shanghai. Depending on where you are heading, you may need to make 1 or 2 transfers though. To get to Pudong or the Bund, it would take 2 transfers and approximately 30-40 minutes.As for the restaurant in the hotel, they served surprisingly good meals. For example, the beef soup noodle was generous, tasty, and reasonable by western standard - this, coming from Chinese Canadians who are accustom to good meals.As for the hotel itself, the lobby looked a little dated, but our room looked more up to date. Make sure you book and ask for the &quot;business&quot; rooms.The bathroom was a good size with a tub. Air conditioning worked great. The bed was on the hard side, but I didn't mind that. Internet was free but was on the slow side. Breakfast, not bad, was also included.We arrived via Pudong International Airport, which is a good 60 minute taxi ride through heavy traffic. We left via Hongqiao International Airport for Beijing. This ride is only at most 20 minutes ride from the hotel.I booked the hotel using my travel points. So I guess it was good value - if you don't mind the location. Jun 15 2018 	Interesting experience	I have just returned from Shanghai BW hotel. It was really a good hotel with reasonable price. Room was clean and comfortable, however the bed was so hard. They welcomed really kindly. There were couple of issues there: they were not speaking english very well, so sometimes the communication was confusing. Breakfast is about 58 RMB, which is really expensive I think, and there is no too much options.Hotel is located in the southwest of Shanghai, out of the main attractions. You can use taxi to the Indoor Stadium metro station - approx. 15-20 min and max 18-20 RMB the cost. With the metro you can reach every attractions and the cost is about 4 RMB.Ask the receptions every time for a taxi card where they can write your destination in Chinese.It is really important, because almost nobody speaking english. Nov 21 2017 	great hotel	I stayed at this hotel in Nov 2017 as it was recommended to me by the Tennis Masters Cup ticket agents in Shanghai. I was told that it was one of the hotels near the Qi Zhong tennis centre.The only negative aspect of this hotel is that it is in the middle of the HongQiao industrial zone!!! To get to anywhere near ( subway, shops etc) you need to take a taxi and it was no where near the tennis center. I ended taking a taxi there the first 2 days ( 30-45 min trip, depending on traffic ,60 - 70 RNMB one way) and then took the shuttles to and from the pick-up points around Shanghai once I got my bearings. I was told by the managment team that there will be a subway station 2 minutes' walk form the hotel byt the end of this year.Otherwise, I had no complaints about this hotel. Great hotel, clean, large, modern rooms. It is also part of some art initiative and so there are pieces of modern art scultpures, paintings, displays all over the hotel. Hotel is sophisticated and well decorated. All rooms have either wifi, internet access, cable tv. Breakfast was both continental and Chinese. There is a full service restaurant there as well specialising in Chinese and Italian cuisine- not very expensive. Staff very friendly and helpful, esp for translating destinations to taxi drivers in chinese. Beware that the average person in Shanghai speaks very little english but the young people are speaking more English now. It is a good idea to learn a few phrases in Mandarin.I would definitely stay there again once the subway station has been completed to make it easier to get into central Shanghai.Arrived at Pudong intl and took the line 3 bus at the airport to the Yin He ( Galaxy) hotel then took a taxi from there to the hotel. Hotel is definitely nearer Hong Qiao airport and taxi there cost about 45 RNMB. I checked out one day after I arrived as I had to fly to Beijing for 2 days and my luggage was stored and I was upgraded to a bigger room/ business room when I returned to check in the 2nd time around.All in all , great , modern, classy hotel best suited for businessmen who have come to do business in the hundreds of factories in the area. Very quiet and all rooks sound-proofed. Having said that, there were many tourists at hotel as well. Shanghai is a great city and will definitely visit again.Enjoy the stay and , by the way, the pics of the hotel are accurate.If anyone wants to contact me about the tennis masters cup , feel free."
"Nov 20 2021 	Good quality nothing special	Stayed here only 2 nights during a business trip. People at the desk, not so nice, no welcome smile at all! Room is average size, but has some plus as a small kitchen (microwave and sink). There are two breakfast rooms: one the the ground floor, with a good choice but too crowded and another on the 14th (... well I do no remember exactly the floor...). This one is reserved only if you have a superior room, so few people in, but very poor choice in my opinion. Position is good, especially if you love italian luxury brands: Gucci and Bottega Veneta shop doors just next to the hotel entrance. Sep 25 2021 	Great location but be aware of the extras	I have stayed at this hotel 3 times, and the third will be the last. Upon reserving I was told internet was complimentary (I would never stay at a hotel who charge for that), but when checking out I was presented with a bill for 2 days of internet at the amount of 30 USD. I protested but they ignored that. They got the 30 dollars extra, but lost a customer. Location is great, breakfast is below average. Rooms are ok, but stiff prices for internet will keep me away from this hotel. Sep 21 2021	Great Value would definitely recommend	I stayed at the Central View Suites on a trip to Shanghai with my mother and was very happy with my choice. The purpose of the trip was simply sightseeing, and sightseeing we did.I'm a very picky on cleanliness and this hotel did not disappoint. There was a convenient safe in the room as well as some snacks in case you get the munchies (though, for the price I suggest stopping to keep nearby). The hotel is located in what would be the high-end, name brand shopping district (i.e. gucci, prada, dolce, ferragamo, burberry, etc) I felt very safe walking the neighborhood late at night and early morning. It's about a 3 block walk to the West Nanjing metro stop. The more central hotels I looked up were not only more expensive, but after walking East Nanjing at night, I would assume much noisier as well. So for the price, you really can't go wrong.My only 'complaints' would be that the bed was a little hard for my taste, but you can request they add some padding to it (which I did) still a little hard but better. Also, I couldn't figure out how to keep the water from not falling out the shower.If you can even call those complaints, my overall experience was very pleasant and simple... and I like simple :) Sep 19 2018	loved this hotel	beautiful hotel, nice rooms, clean, cental location. no need to stay at the ritz carlton when you can save money here. the only disappointment was the breakfast buffet in the morning. it stays open unitl 10am, but they stop putting out the (lukewarm) food around 9am. everything else was superb, including the front desk who went out of thier way to translate my list of things to do in english to mandarin--very helpful. lots of great bars in the neighborhood also, since the hotel bar is kind of dead at night.

"Oct 10 2021 	Great Hotel but small rooms	My stay at the City Hotel was wonderful. Service was excellent, the front desk personnel spoke great English, and they were helpful in recommending sites and restaurants in the area and happy to call cabs for me in the rainy weather. The rooms were very clean, we had a nice view of the city, and the bathrooms were very nice. The only flaw with the rooms is that our room was the smallest I had during my stay in China, but it was worth it given the hotel's amenities and service. The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood, 2 blocks from a Starbucks serving breakfast and lunch, and with lots of cute stores nearby. I would stay at the City Hotel again without hesitation. Oct 1 2021 	Good place for the business traveler	Did stay in this Hotel for 4 nights...had an fantastic room almost on the top floor with an breathtaking view over Shanghai...Pretty close to the old exhibition center and that´s what I was lookin for...Will stay there again next year.Don´t think that I would stay there for Holidays, most attractions are too far away, but anyhow...spending your holidays in Shanghai???? xcuse me?What was terrible: The breakfast...gosh that was bad....just had it once and that was enough...okay..no need for this... Aug 22 2021 	Definitely an excellent hotel	Extremely well situated right at the French concession; We booked thru Rates to go with an excellent rate of 42 euros/room however Rates to go service is just useless as they have forgotten to fax our reservation. City hotel managed to get us 2 double rooms, Very reliable and helpful staff. . We did not get any breakfast at the hotel as you can have the chinese breakfast (dumplings) for 10 yuan at 15 meters from the hotel or Star'bucks at 50 meters.We are extremely pleased with this hotel and will certainly come back for our next stay in Shanghai Aug 21 2021 	Surprinsingly very good	We stayed at this hotel for a week and based on my previous experience, this hotel is really good value for money. The faclilites are excellent and the staff is simly great, very helpful and always with a smile on thier face. Please be aware that they will tell you what you need to know and no more, I mean you wont get any proactive advise, for instance, if you ask how long a taxi will take from the hotel to the airport, they will say about an hour, but will not explain that there are road works on the way and could potentially take considerably more time. This s not an attitude is simply the way they are.This hotel is located right in the French Concession near beautiful shops and some hidden beautiful restaurants. (Avoid the restaurant on 1 South Shanxi Road if you are not adventurous). There is a wonderful little sort of eatery on Shanxi Road (left hand side of the hotel, same side walk - you need to cross the 1st street and then keep walking for around 50 metres) You can see how they cook dumplings. You need to buy tokens from the lady at the cashier and then exchange for the food you want. We had really unexpensive wonderful dinners there. Also their stuff is very friendly and very willing to give foraigners a hand. I would go again anytime Jun 9 2021 	Exceptional MGMT 	As a traveler you always dread the unexpected surprises when traveling, especially after a tiring day or a long trip. Not here....everyday was a reward to one's self for a job well done. The City Hotel and it's staff where exeptionally accomodating and quick to please. A reflection of it's management attitude to provide 5 star service and exceptionally reasonable rates. It is convienetly located to great shopping, good restaurants and the metro is a short 12 minute walk away. You can only pay more to find a hotel with this level of comfort and service. All of the hotels in house restaurants provide stellar food and service. Its also a great place to relax, have a quiet business cocktail and enjoy great fare at reasonable prices. With its fitness center, in house spa there is absolutely no reason to leave. I now call City Hotel home when traveling to Shanghai. Thank You to the Mgmt for a job well done and for making me feel like I was someone special! Jerry Lee Gomez San Antonio, Texas Mar 28 2021 	Positive experience	I spent 6 nights in City Hotel with freinds. we were on the 25th level. It was awsome. The neighbourhood is clean, lots of shopping, transportation...Staff are freindly. Sep 25 2018 	Perfect Location	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our September trip to Shanghai.We really liked this hotel for several reasons:1. Location - It is situated in very close to the old French Concession area of Shanghai, so if you want to walk around and take a look at the &quot;old&quot; Shanghai of 20s and 30s - it's a perfect place. Also, two blocks away is West Najing road with TWO huge brand new malls, which house all of the brand shops you expect to see in a major city - D&amp;G, LV, Armani, Versace, etc. So if you're into shopping - the location is excellent. Also this hotel is away from the major tourist areas, so you won't find big crowds of peddlers of fake goods (DVDs, bags, watches, etc) as you might closer to the Bund or East Nanjing Road.2. Food - there are several restaurants in the hotel, including an Excellent Japanese sushi restaurant, American Steakhouse and a tradition Chinese restaurant. It's very hard to find a place in Shanghai that has all those choices under one roof. Plus two blocks away in modern malls on Nanjing road you'll find more restaurants choices - Western, Chinese, mixed, etc.3. Service - everyone is very friendly and helpful.Rooms were pretty good, nothing exceptional, but very clean and had everything we expected to have. Plenty of English channels on TV, which is always nice to have in China.We actually paid extra to substitute this hotel for another hotel, because of its' location and we weren't disappointed. Mar 24 2018 	Average simple business hotel	Average Shanghai business hotel 2km south west from People square. In my opinion a good solution for whoever is looking for a clean hotel, quiet at an affordable price. Service is good, english speaking personal. The breakfast is above average.The main weakness is the swimming pool and fitness room. The best is to consider that there is none. Apr 30 2017	Avoid this hotel!	A group of 6 people rented three rooms for the period 19-24 April, and then 4 people stayed yet another night between 25-26 April in this place.During checkout on the 24th, one of our rooms was quite full with boxes, bags and suitcases. In this chaotic situation one of the cabin bags was left either inside the room or outside the room, but not with us. Returning to the hotel later that day, we realized that this bag is missing. To make a long story short:- it took two hours to convince hotel personnel to look for this bag, which then was found partly emptied- the hotel acted very rudely towards us, like it was our fault- despite our repeated attempts we never received any papers enlisting the damage we suffered. We finally received a Chinese-language fax which is probably the Shanghai Police notice of the events.- the hotel made us feel like idiots and to make matters worse upon our return, one of the bellboys dropped a suitcase and damaged another.My advice is to avoid this hotel, there are so many other nice, clean hotels around! Jan 4 2017 	Unpretentious but good hotel	I stayed at City Hotel in Shanghai for ten days, from the 18th to the 28th of December and I spent a nice holiday there. First of all the location: The location is ideal, five minutes walking from the central Shanxi Nan lu metro station, in the French Connection, one of the best areas in Shanghai. The staff is friendly and helpful and at the front desk there are ladies who speak English. I know people who stayed in other four stars hotels in Shanghai were nobody of the staff spoke English...;-( I changed rooms twice, the first one at the no-smoking 10th floor and the second at the no-smoking 17th floor, both very clean, confortable and with a nice view of the futuristic scenery of Shanghai. They were both superior standard rooms so that the cheapest ones but, anyhow, very nice.I had breakfast few times in the hotel. It is not included in the room rate and it cost 80RMB, about 8 euros/ a day. It is not too bad but I agree with the previous review of Mr. Amherst: the staff is not always very friendly. By the way, there is a Starbucks 3 minutes far from the hotel where sometimes I had my breakfast. I did not try the restaurants and the cafè in the hotel.The only bad thing of the hotel was the deposit they asked me in advance the first day I arrived. I had already paid all the amount for the room through Expedia but they asked me 3000RMB (300RMB per day) for any possible service I would use for the forthcoming days. I refused to pay all this money so I gave them 600RMB for the deposit that I had back the last day.Besides, the 24hour music cable radio on the corridors of the floors is simply terrible. Dec 19 2006 	An OK hotel	The hotel's location is ideal, somewhere in between the Huaihai Zhong Lu in the old French Concession and the Nanjing Xi Lu, with a comfortable distance.I made the reservation on the internet through a travel agency in Shanghai, and was informed that I would pay my bills to the hotel directly. I fount the people at the front dest were very friendly. Later in my room, I somehow forgot about the little keyholding box by the door. When a bellboy took my luaggage into my room and left, I could not find the room key, which the bellboy had left at the door key holding box. I called the front desk telling the person that I could not find the key. They duplicated the key for me immediately in a friendly manner.The only place I feel needed improvement was the Vienna Room at the breakfast time. The services were VERY uneven. Sometime the service was friendly and efficient, but in other morrnings the services were cold, negligence, and VERY bad. The hotelroom service was good. Cleaning ladies were conscientious. I particularly remember a cleaning lady on the 10th floor, Ms. Wu Yuxia. Still, after a few days staying at the hotel, I haven't used to take the roomkey out with me when I went out, and I forgot the key in the room and could not get in. I found Ms. Wu Yuxia and told her about this. She helped me by making several phone calls, and finally openned the door for me. She apologized that she must follow the rules before letting me into my room. This was evident of a responsible employee at the hotel. I believe she deserves my thanks and respect.I also found that the bellboys and people at the hotel gate were quite friendly.I stayed at the hotel for five days, but I did not have chance to taste the several restaurants in the hotel. Dec 6 2006 	Never been in any bad place like this before	It needs at least 2 pages to describe all feelings I got from this hotel. I've been in many hotels around the world, only cheap hotels made me feel a bit upset (not much coz I know what I should get for that rate).At City hotel, even smiling was quite hard to get at the first step of arrival. That's the 1st thing. The 2nd, my flight arrived Shanghai at 6:30 p.m. so, I asked the hotel to keep the room for me. They asked me for the credit card guarantee even my company sent reservation letter at least 2 weeks prior. So, my company sent the comfirmation letter to the hotel again as City hotel is one of our contracted hotels.The 3rd thing was, they asked for credit card guarantee which is fine for me if they just did it for guarantee. But what they did was blocking a whole amount of staying, 9 nights plus personal expenses 300 RMB per day. It was charged 8,100 RMB at the first night!!! And what made me so angry is that amount is blocking my credit line, STILL! (I checked-out from this hotel since Nov. 29, 2006. The actual amount already cut from my credit card but the guarantee amount is still there.) The 4th was, the services at Front desk, cafe at the 4th floor and else were ineffective. Some of them couldn't understand English at all. The 5th, I ordered breakfast box on only WEEKDAY since I had to go to work very early morning. And I wrote on the paper to show the receptionist that I didn't want any on WEEKEND. What I got was EVERYDAY boxes even on the last night I called the receptionist to inform that I wanted to wake up late on the departure date. The receiver didn't understand what I said then sent room service girl to ask what I want again. I did explain to her again and she seemed understand it very well. Guess what I got, I got the box at 6 a.m. as everyday!!!The 6th, I always got all services from the receptionists without any smiling. Only a few girls there can smile and know how to deal with guests. For me, some of bell boys at concierge can speak and understand English much better than receptionists and also know the word, service-mind quite well. Moreover, it's a bit ridiculous for me when I, a guest, had to greet them first everytime we met. Being nice is not suitable for this hotel, I guess. :PAnyway, maybe, I expected too much for the rate, 862 RMB per night. What I can say for this hotel, its location is the best thing nothing else. Jun 2 2006	Nice clean tourist class hotel in great area	I booked a 3 night stay here via Travelocity - deluxe room was reasonably priced at 104 USD per night. This was attractive compared to the chain hotels whose rates were at least 50% more. The location is in the French Concession on a main road with lots of boutiques and little shops. About 4 blocks from the metro stop (Shan Xi road), which is a huge shopping area as well. Safe area at night - no problems walking alone or getting a taxi.The front desk staff speak reasonable English and buffet breakfast was included in my room rate, which was convenient. Food was average with a selection of western and Asian choices. There are only a couple floors that are non-smoking (4?) and the room was very clean. The bed was a little low (no boxspring) but nice and firm mattress with lots of pillows. Bottled water (2) was provided in the bathroom and replenished daily - which I needed for brushing my teeth (don't drink the tap water!). The light system was a bit complex to deal with - I could not find a setting to shut of all the lights for bedtime. In the end, I simply removed the room key from the power setting at the door.The crowd at the hotel appeared to be mostly tour groups from Europe and parts of Asia, with the occasional vacationing couple. Would stay here again if the rates were still relatively reasonable. Jun 1 2006	Nothing bad to say about this hotel	Shanghai City Hotel was a positive suprise for me and my mom who really expected just a shabby 2-3 star hotel. The hotel has recently been renovated and everything was new and clean.The staff where very friendly and did indeed speak english. At least so much that we where able to conduct our buissness and the needed services e.g. getting a taxi, adresses written in Chinese, using internet,exchanging money. Certainly the hotel is worth more than 3 stars, it is if not a 4 star at least 3++. The price is very cheap compared to what I would rate the hotel and the location couldn`t be better. 5-10min walk to nearest metro station(Shanxinan road) and taxis always waiting outsaid the hotel. The &quot;doorman&quot; always very polite greets you and asks if you need a taxi.Then he goes and gets it for you and even tells the driver in Chinese where you want to go. Be sure to take the hotels card, on which it reads in Chinese the adress of the hotel, whith you when you go by taxi so that you can show it to the driver when you come back. We stayd 6 nights in the hotel, booked by the internet the superior room, whitout breakfast. (Cost about 200 euros/person)Everything went smoothly, we even tryed the brekfast for a couple of mornings and where very pleast whith it. I would certainly use this hotel again when returning to Shanghai. It was cheap, well located,(just beside Hengshang Moller Villa) clean, renewed, friendly and just 5-10 min walk to Nanjing or Huihai shopping street, metro or Xiangyang &quot;fake market&quot;. Sadly the fake market will be moving to some other location in July 2006. Mar 2 2006	Fantastic breakfast	I was amazed at the helpfull nature of the staff and there willingness to try to speak english. I was a few months pregnant and the breakfast did more than needed to satisfy me and the baby, it was varied and great. We Only stayed 2 nights back in April 05 and its ideal location to the famed fashion market and Yu Yen gardens was great. Will be going back to Shanghai again in March 06 and will definatly stay in the this hotel.Did not realise till leaving there is a cash machine in the lobby tucked away round the corner, so much easier than trying to change sterling at the desk.Forgot to submit review last year! Feb 9 2006 	More than 2 stars	I was surprised to see this hotel rated as only 2 stars, perhaps because I stayed in an &quot;executive&quot; room on a nonsmoking floor. I would give it 3 stars, and would stay there again.I had one serious problem, which was that the room smelled of sewage the first night. However, the smell was gone by the next morning and did not return except faintly in the bathroom from time to time. I suspect that if I had complained they would have moved me to another room.The room was nicely decorated and clean, if a bit small. The free internet connection worked well, though I would recommend leaving your computer off or disconnecting it from net when unattended. Note that internet is free in executive rooms, and costs extra in other rooms. The internet fee almost equals the difference between a deluxe and executive room, so you might as well go for the executive level if you want internet access.The light switches by the bed were a little illogical -- the left-hand switch operated the right-hand light and vice versa. English TV channels are minimal. Sound insulation seemed good, and you can open the windows slightly even though it's a high rise. The location is convenient to most of downtown Shanghai.The included buffet breakfast is reasonable quality and presents limitless opportunities for stuffing yourself. The Western food doesn't vary much from day to day, but the Chinese dishes seemed to change more. I didn't sample the other food.The staff is friendly, but the level of English is uneven. I had better luck face to face than on the phone.The executive room rate includes free laundry service for one tee-shirt. I found out later that this is per *stay*, not per day, which seems stingy for a long stay. Nov 12 2005 	It's good	I didn't want to pay lots of money and some hotels are now very expensive and not very Chinese. I took a suite at City which cost $160 ish. I was very pleased with it. It's Chinese and whilst room service doesn't always come exactly as ordered, they will immediately go fetch bits you wanted with a willing heart. I stayed for 6 nights and found the staff friendly, helpful and will refuse a tip if offered! It is well situated to see the sites. It made my trip really enjoyable and will use it again because it's Shanghai, some of the other hotels,you could be anywhere in the world. Apr 20 2005 	Great location good value	This is a nice hotel that is within walking or short cab distance from almost everywhere we went in Shanghai. The common areas are beautiful and the rooms are above average (mine was a little worn, but clean). One thing I liked about this hotel is that I could open the window in my room. The internet connection in room was fine, and they have a business center that can help with a variety of services. Breakfast was included with the room and they had a wide selection of Asian and European foods. My only complaint is that the staff doesn't speak English well enough to consistently get you the food, information, or directions that you need. The supervisors can help, but we had a few mis-ques that were annoying. Nov 19 2021 	???????? Sep 6 2021 	???? Feb 25 2021 	??????????????? Jan 2 2021 	???????????????"
"Hidden Gem in Pudong	This hotel proves that Pudong is a great base for a Shanghai visit.We stayed here for half the price that we paid for our Puxi-side hotel, but we were very comfortable nonetheless. Outstanding Courtyard hotel, with marble lobby and foyer. The staff graciously granted our request for extra towels too. Room service was satisfactory and everything was clean. The bathroom is immaculate, with a deep tub and two massage showerheads, perfect for a tiring day of exploration.Within walking distance were a few Chinese and international restaurants, a shopping center, a subway exit. The Pudong sights are one or two subway exits away and People's Square is the exit after those.Free wifi would have made our stay perfect, but internet access was just too expensive.If you're on a budget but want to stay in a comfortable hotel that's nearby the main attractions in Shanghai, this is the place for you. Nov 23 2021 	My ""go to"" hotel	I have stayed at this hotel at least 10 times. It might not be the greatest hotel in Shanghai but for the price it is my hotel of choice. The rooms are clean, the food is great, the service is excellent, and the location is strategic. For me, I like to stay here because it is closer to the airport and also closer to the Pudong Riverwalk area with the great restaurants. A taxi to the hotspot is about 5 minutes and 15 RMB. Everyone speaks great English and the GM is a wonderful Aussie lady who really knows how to run a hotel! For the price you simply cannot beat it. The breakfast buffet is excellent. I only wish the internet was cheaper than $20 per day, but that is a Marriott decision throughout China... Nov 18 2021 	Great Value	The best Courtyard Marriot you'll ever stay in. The restaurant, club-level lounge, room -- everything was much nicer than you'd expect at this price. I wouldn't stay here on vacation, but for a work trip it was just right. Oct 12 2021 	Excellent value and convenient	We took advantage of a very low rate on expedia, and although there were some surprise fees (perhaps fully disclosed but hard to understand), it was a very good experience. The location is quite convenient - very inexpensive to get a cab into Puxi, or to take the metro, just two blocks away. Good breakfast at a &quot;au bon pain&quot; type place 1/2 block away on the way to the metro. We at first were unsure of staying in Pudong because it seemed so far from the 'action' in Puxi, but really it's so easy to get back and forth, and frankly we liked Pudong - easier to breathe, and the price was just incredible. Rooms were very nice, and staff was very friendly and helpful. Only complaint - the business center is astronomically expensive - you can easily spend more at the business center than your room costs, so keep it to a minimum! Aug 10 2021 	Very good hotel for a correct price	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and found a very good hotel for a correct price. Although this is not a luxury hotel as a standard Marriott hotel, we had a big room with a king size bed and a high quality service. The staff speaks a very good english, which is not the standard in China.I would recommend this hotel for people looking for a good and reliable accomodation for a good price. Aug 2 2021 	Good Stay for weekend.	I got quite a good deal at just over 450 RMB per night over the weekend including tax.Very helpful staff at the check-in desk, they were a big help as I had problems with my checkin. The staff at the lobby bar is also very friendly and helpful. Overall I had a good stay at the hotel over the weekend. It is quite new a new shopping mall called 96??? Jul 2 2021 	Good	The location of this property may not be too strategic for shopping but due to convenience to office, i have selected this hotel. The rates offered is also quite affordable compared to many other hotels. Though the hotel looked quite dodgy from outside but its actually not too bad. What i like about this hotel is the room is actually quite nice and cosy. The rooms are also kept very clean which is my main concern. I had trouble using their steam iron and within few minutes from my call to the operator, I had the housekeeping girl came to assist me. Though sha cant speak english very well but she is definitely very friendly and helpful. The reception staffs were quite friendly as well. I also like the bellboys cos they always helped me to catch a cab. They were helpful all the time.I would recommend this hotel for those who wants value for money. I only used the room and breakfast facilities, the rest I have not explored. As for breafast selection, it was not too extensive but i love the croissonts! It was excellent! Jun 23 2021 	Good Hotel Great Service for the frequent traveler.	During 2017-2018, I spent 6 months (off and on) living in Shanghai. The Courtyard Marriott became my 2nd home.The hotel itself is a 10-15 minute walk from the PuDong Times Square (shopping area), but there isn't much else near the hotel, and there is limited food (McDonalds, local restaurants) nearby. The restaurant itself has a nice Chinese and American restaurants, although it is a little pricey (typical for Shanghai restaurants that cater to Americans). The rooms are very clean, but are slightly below average in size, and non-descript.However, what I loved about this hotel was the staff. They will do anything to please you if you just ask them. One of my colleagues lost his luggage and only had one shirt, but the bellhop top his only shirt and found a laundry service open at another hotel at 2am and had it cleaned for him. This was typical of the service level that I experienced. After being there for 2-3 weeks, all the staff called me by name.If your business travel requires you to be within walking distance of PuDong Times square, I would recommend this hotel. If you are traveling on vacation, I would recommend a hotel on the Puxi side. May 17 2021 	Good Hotel  Very helpful Staff	I found the hotel comfortable &quot;Not Luxurious&quot; The staff were very polite, and helped whenever asked.Breakfasts were good, The Place to eat looked very small, but there was always tables and so it worked very well&quot;The food of an evening and day is excellent value for money and the staff are happy to explain whats what.Only complaint i had , was the prices of the drinks &quot;alcoholic&quot; Spirits are extortionate , doubles i would avoid , at best they are triple the UK price if not more.The internet is also far too expensive, although worked well &quot;This should have been Free of charge&quot;I would certainly stay here again on my next trip Apr 5 2021 	A very friendly hotel...but not near anything terribly exciting	We stayed here for 4 nights for business and were quite pleased overall with the experience. The rooms were clean and designed in an Asian theme. Beds were comfortable, and pillows fluffy. HOWEVER, it was freezing cold in the city when we arrived, and there was heat in the hotel. The front desk said that the heat is controlled by head office so they do not have authority to turn it on and off at their free will. So we froze. They did give us extra blankets, but in zero degree weather, we need heating. Especially considering it's a Marriott hotel! For food, McDonalds is just down the road a bit, and there are plenty of local restaurants near the hotel as well. Unfortuantely, there is only one shopping mall within walking distance from the hotel, but there is a larger one further down the road (we didn't try to walk it), but I suspect it's a 20-30 minute walk away. Also, you have to pay for Internet. It was quite expensive from what I remember. I'd go back if they'd turn on their heating when it's cold, and AC when it's hot. P.S. Andy the bellhop boy is a gem. Very smily and friendly. Mar 24 2021 	Average Business Hotel	Rooms:Low ceiling but room furnishings and bed was clean and comfortable. Toilet could do with a more luxurious feel. Air-con temperature not adjustable or slow to response. Breakfast:Service staff was courteous. Unfortunately, food was never replenish and there were too many empty trays (did not matter if I came to breakfast at 7.30am or 9am). Hot food (i.e Fried Eggs, Noodles) counter kitchen staff generally ignored the customers, so had to raise my voice to get some attention. Food was too plain and if this did not come with my Room fee, I would not have bothered. But savings grace was their Juice counter which had a variety of freshly squeeze juice.Facilities:Gym was small and not condusive for a workout.Service:Generally, the staff was courteous and good natured. Room extension for 1 hour was rejected. This hotel also caters to local businessman, and they tend to bud-in when you are dealing with the counter staff.Location:In the Pudong area with many local and also cheap eateries nearby. For shopping, there is a local shopping mall 2 blocks away. Within 10mins walking distance of Yaohan and Times Sqaure. Massage Shops (probably the happy ones) round the corner. Feb 20 2021	Very plush comfortable Hotel more than the average traveller needs	No mistake this is a very nice hotel - but probably a bit over the top for most travellers paying their own bill. Rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean, service is first class - but the place lacks any real atmosphere. Ideal for a business trip or an overnight stay but not really for the leisure traveller. Pudong is a fair hike from The Bund, Yu Gardens and Nanging Road so holidaymakers might be better off with a more central location. Jan 5 2021 	Very good hotel in Pudong	One night stay for business.The hotel was suggested by a major customer with special rates. Slept in a big suite at a very good price. Dec 25 2018 	Very good hotel in Shanghai	A perfect hotel in Shanghai, with a very helpful and smiling staff. We definitely recommend this hotel, even if it is a bit far from the city centre (if one can define a center in Shanghai), and reachable by direct metro (line 7, 4 and 6 at Century Avenue) or taxi (not expensive, expect 20 RMB minimum to go to old town for instance). Dec 22 2018 	Decent hotel good location	Stayed here on a free night in Shanghai. Decent rate and good location. About 2 blocks from metro station. 45 mintes by taxi to airport. Oct 27 2018	Not Marriott Quality; There Are Better Places in Shanghai	I spend many nights a year at Marriotts because they are consistently above average. This hotel was the exception.The front desk check-in was slow and lackadaisical. They refused to accept my Marriott card for reasons that they could not explain. When my message light was on and the message said there was a package at the front desk, they could not find the package (it was delivered to my room several hours later.) There are not enough elevators to service all of the floors, and they elevators were s-l-o-w. The food was average.The room was smallish. There was one small water bottle in the room (for two people) whereas every other hotel we stayed at in China had two large ones. The hair drier did not work and there was a large stain on the carpet. The first morning we were there the room contained 6 packets of decaf coffee and none of regular. The second morning we were there the shower head blew off the shower when we turned it on. The soap bar in the bathroom was miniscule; hardly shower size.This was the worst hotel we stayed at in China. I could not believe it was a Marriott property. Sep 21 2018 	Decent and Good Value	A little rough and worn around the edges but decent hotel for business or pleasure providing good value. Comfortable bed (Marriott standard) and average room size. Could be a little cleaner (carpets need good cleaning) and hot water takes some time to get going. Staff is English-challenged but you can usually communicate or they'll find staff with better English skills. Restaurant (Spices) has limited menu and food is just average. For example, fish and chips should not be frozen fish sticks. Recommend you eat out or at another hotel (e.g. Shangri-La has good restaurants but pricey). McDonald's and KFC are within walking distance if you are desperate for fast food. ATM (China Construction Bank) is right around the corner.You can walk to nearest Metro station (Line 2) about 15 minutes away (Century Avenue station), which can put you on the other side of the river in the heart of the Bund (Nanjing Road) in about 10 minutes. Walking distance to Oriental Pearl Tower and two tall towers (Jin Mao and Shanghai World Financial Center); about 20-30 minutes.I prefer Renaissance Pudong because it is newer and nicer but you can save a couple hundred or more yuan by staying at the Courtyard. Sep 7 2018 	Very happy with this Hotel	I am writing this from my room in the Shanghai Courtyard Marriott on my third night here. MY AC works great; the food is very good (a little pricey, breakfast is overpriced for Shanghai), room service is quick and efficient. Taxi rides to everywhere are very reasonable and there is a metro station within a short walk. I have had no communication problems and everyone has been extremely nice here. Best of all the bed is larger and the pillows are down-filled and abundant! Much better than my first five nights which I spent at the Zhongyou hotel. Great hotel if you are here on business. May 30 2018 	Good Value Hotel. Location is ok.	For the money, this hotel is a decent deal. Although, there are better options out there. The hotel is clean as well as the rooms. Nothing fancy. It is an american business hotel. Although, it is much bigger than the Courtyard Mariott's in the states. The food is great in the Cafe, especially the buffet. The bar is in the atrium and is nice as well. The A/C for some reason doesn't work very well. We had problems in one of our rooms with the A/C and were switched to another room. The lobby is also hot sometimes as I guess the hotel likes to save money on A/C. It is about a five minute walk to the Metro and we couldn't find the hotel upon exiting the metro, so make sure you get directions where the hotel is upon exiting the metro. I would definately recommend taking the MagLev from the Airport to the Metro, then using the Metro over a Cab ride, it is much cheaper.It is located in Pudong, but there is not much around. Cab rides around the City are very cheap, so getting to the Bund or the French Concession is fairly inexpensive. Mar 24 2018 	Great value hotel!	I am glad I stayed at the Courtyard Shaghai in Pudong. This hotel is superior than the Courtyard hotels in the US. The entrance lobby with marble floors is elegant. My room and bathroom were clean, quiet and the bed comfortable. They provide you with terry bathrobbe and slippers. The staff is courteous and always smiling. The times I requested room service, they were at my door within minutes. While the hotel offers Western and Chinese cuisine, I preferred to eat in the restaurants close to the hotel, which are very good and inexpensive. The only drawback is that is not close to downtown Shanghai. You have to take a taxi or the subway (a 5-10 minute walk). Fortunately the cost for a ride into town is dirt cheap, anywhere $3.50 to $5.00 and taxi drivers don't expect a tip! Dec 30 2017 	Good business hotel	Good hotel for business purposes but because it's in Pudong, you have to rely on public transportation or the cab to go to Shanghai which means planning about an hour each way. Otherwise, the rooms are nice, clean and comfortable and the service is what you expect from MarriottCourtyard. Oct 25 2017 	Good quality convenient location	A fairly typical Marriott hotel which fills a tower in the Pudong area of Shanghai. This is the main business district and the hotel is squarely aimed at business customers. This is not the cheapest business hotel in Shanghai by a long way, but it's not extortionate for the level of service provided. It has all the usual features - reasonable sized rooms with good quality beds and furniture, effective air con, good cleanliness, well equipped bathroom, Internet (at a charge), hotel shop, concierge.... Breakfast is plentiful and available from 6.30. Some unusal items that reflect the local cuisine, but all the western staples are there if you are not feeling adventurous.Most desk staff are English speaking; other staff less so, but no major problems encountered.A big plus is that the hotel is only a block from the Shiji Avenue metro stop. This is on the line that connects with the airport maglev in one direction, and runs through the city centre in the other. In total it took me 30 mins from leaving the airport terminal to arriving at the hotel, which is 30 mins less than it took a colleague to do it in a taxi.There is also a range of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Apr 3 2017	Take the Heat	Five nights of Misery. Lack of quality communication is the basic harrasment you will face. Most of the staffers are trainees so they are worse in language and skills.My misery royale was the poor airconditoning and roon temperature around 24 degrees celcius and to add injury to nsult they maintained that its official temperature.No senior met me to resolve the problem or change my room. Food and room service a disappontment. In general a total disappointment. f i had time i would have checked out the second day.Saving Grace is clean rooms, comfortable beds and good housekeeping. Mar 17 2017	Beautiful Hotel	This is a beautiful hotel and the staff was supremely welcoming. My workplace booked this hotel, so I was not expecting much. I was very pleasantly surprised. My one and only complaint, and it's not really a complaint, is that the restaurant menu could have had more selection for dinner. However, I'm a picky eater so don't put too much stock in that comment. Breakfast buffet selection western food) was really yummy. Oct 3 2006	Best deal in Shanghai	I've stayed at a number of Courtyards in the US, so I guess I was expecting something similar in Shanghai. Instead I was treated to something more on the level of Marriott's finer domestic hotels. The staff was great and it'll cost half of what the upper echelon hotels will run you. The neighborhood is a bit boring, but a $2 cab ride will get you to the subway and from there anywhere you could want to go. May 24 2006	Great Hotel	Stayed 5 nights at this wonderfully run hotel ..congratulations to all the staff .. professional and very polite and friendly. Oct 6 2021 	?????????????? Apr 23 2021 	Excelente pero caro"
"Nov 24 2021 	Very good indeed!	Me and my father (family owned business) stayed at this Courtyard Marriott for 4 nights this mid november. We got a good  rate on Expedia (USD108), which I thought to be reasonable compared to similar grade hotels (150 and up). Having stayed at a &quot;chinese&quot; hotel in Hangzhou, I decided not to adventure again. kept it simple with the Marriott chain.The hotel is very new - it just opened in June, so all amenities and commom areas were very well mantained. Awesome bar at the lobby floor, very stylish, cool restaurant on 2nd floor and a nice gym at 4th (pool too). We had lovely hostess girl experience. They are fun and very willing. Location-wise, its perfect - just byGrand Gateway mall, metroCity, a subway station and Papa Johns and Starbucks!! Being a brasilian with an american education, I just loved to re-encounter papa johns pizza again!! And all of this on a 3-5 minutes walk!The bad part is all services are paid - breakfast was not included on our rate, so add another 26 USD and USD 17 for internet. But still, if you are in leisure and just want to check emails, it's cheaper to go to a cybercafe. And for the food, go to starbucks or Costas Café, and you'll be set. However, I must be fair, it's one hell of a breakfast they offer, and for americans and europeans, where breakfast anywhere may be around 20-30 USD, this amount may be just about right - but even though it's very well served, it's a little to much for my brasilian budget (in comparison terms, a nice breakfast here costs around 10 bucks).One short note, there is also a tailor shop right before the inside front door of the hotel. They have this special sale, where you can get 3 custom made shirts for 48 bucks each. I just couldnt hold myself and bought 9 shirts and loved it!!! They deliver in 2 days.In short, I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to people. Jul 28 2021 	New pristine hotel super service good price	The service was superb. The staff was plentiful and always available and eager to help. The room was beautiful, pristine, nicely appointed, and had an American soft bed! Apples in the room. The hotel is brand new and spotless. After a month of standard Chinese hotels, and firm beds, I found this to be heavenly. Location is very good. A beautiful 6 floor elegant mall across the street. Subway stop just up the block. Rooms were running about $90+ per night. Restaurant offers western and Asian foods at reasonable prices. I loved the hotel, the staff, the room, and the amenities. The internet is a bit pricey at 120 yuan (about $17) and the breakfast buffet with an amazing array of delicacies was about 170 yuan ($25). So if you and in breakfast and internet, it's not as much of a bargain. Jun 28 2021 	I had a great stay at this hotel	I had a great stay at this hotel. I have chosen this place since it was the only international hotel in Xujiahui Area. I was very surprised which product is behind the new Courtyard line. It has nothing to do with the American ones and even the European Courtyards are different. This one is a full service hotel and doesn’t look like a Courtyard.The Gym and the swimming pool are fantastic and the service and food in the Restaurant is casual but outstanding. Especially the breakfast buffet is not what you would expect in a Courtyard, Honestly it is even better than in some Renaissance or Marriott’s I have stayed before. Rooms are ok, not big but cozy. Check in was good and the Service overall tried there best to make my stay comfortable. The bar gave me are good start in the evening with the happy hour and Alan was a great guy and filed up my glass well… I would recommend everybody which likes to have a five star stay for a four star pocket. Jun 5 2021 	Big Surprise and fantastic stay	I travelled to Shanghai for 1 day business and four days leisure and was booked in the newly opened Courtyard. The rate was very good and I thought, ok it's a Courtyard, but as I arrived I was amazed. What a great hotel. Not comparable to any other Courtyard's I have ever seen. Full Service Hotel with a great heated Swimming pool and a, I guess, around 250 - 300 sq Gym with the newest cardio etc. This Courtyard is designed following the new style, the friendly bellboy David told me proud. Check in was good, not great but the Lady was very friendly and explained me all amenities of the hotel. Also the MoMo Cafe Concept. I remember something with Modern Eating. Anyway, the restaurant offers a fantastic breakfast buffet with daily changing chef's special like a Breakfast Pizza or Spinach Frittata. Never had that before.. But the Pizza overall is just great!The room size is ok and the room design interesting with a sliding door to separate bedroom and bathroom. I personally liked it a lot. Room was clean.Staff is very friendly and try to do there best to made my stay most comfortable. They have done a great job since they just have opened in February. I definitely would recommend this hotel for any traveler. And thr location next to the French Conssesion is very convenient to visit Bar's and Restaurants. Also inside 5 minutes walking distance are three big shopping malls including IT with four floors. May 14 2021 	Good job	The staff in this hotel were really friendly and helpful throughout our stay, my compliments! As a gold member I got access to the executive lounge, which I can warmly recommend for any business traveller to Shanghai. The rooms are not big, but nicely designed, and the bed was great. The fitness center in this hotel is one of the few I have seen in an international hotel that feels like a real gym, also again thanks to the attentive staff. The prices are not yet as high as in some other good hotels in Shanghai, so in all, this hotel is a good deal. May 11 2021 	Very Satisfied Customer (Twice)	I have now stayed at the Courtyard twice over the last 3 months and each time have been impressed with the hotel rooms, facilities and staff. I have found the staff to be incredibly friendly and efficient. While the hotel may not be close to the city centre it is relatively close to areas such as the French Concession. For me it is a very convenient 5 minute walk to my office. I will not hesitate to return. Apr 20 2021 	Terrible Stay...	We were expecting this hotel to be very nice as it is the 800th one in the world. The renovation was quite pleasant in the lobby, but as soon as we got into the room, it was way too small for what we had paid for. The bathroom was linked to the entrance, some sort of architectural design to make the bathroom seem bigger. This created inconvenience because if one person was in the bathroom, the other person could not leave or enter the room. The bathroom door also had no lock. All we wanted was a pleasant, clean and care-free place to stay, but instead the bathroom design gave us unneccessary inconvenience to the hotel room use. This designis okay if you are staying by yourself, but definitely not for 2 or more people. Feb 19 2021 	Disappointed	We checked in the hotel 2 days after the official opening day, however, we still felt the hotel was not ready to open. No hotel directory, no toothbrush and no shaving kit in the room upon check in. I was asking the weather of the day, but they gave me a phone no. to call by myself. What a nice service!!! By the way, the toilet door was unable to open as its stuck on the floor. Upon checked, no sincere fond farewell and even THANK YOU FOR STAYING WITH US. VERY disappointed.... Feb 1 2021 	brand new courtyard the 800th one in the chain	We checked into the brand new Courtyard Shanghai Xujiahui on 27 January 2021, apparently 4 days after the hotel opened. The decor is very modern and pleasing. The room we had for 2 adults with 2 beds was a bit small and the commode and shower were encased in a plexiglass material. For some privacy while using the bathroom one had to close the bedroom area off with the rolling breakfront. The shower was excellent with a choice of rain shower head or hand held adjustable shower. Bathroom amenities were very nice.The buffet breakfast was served in the executive lounge on the 23th floor. Not sure if this will be the case when the hotel is fully up and running. We enjoyed the coffee and bread and cereal options. Most of the hot dishes were Oriental items, so we stuck with the cold items and were pleased.The staff was gracious and helpful. Nice TV, reading material, computer access and sitting area available.They have a nicely equipped gym and an absolutely beautiful pool on the 4th floor.The hotel is within walking distance to the metro and near 2 nice shopping malls. The Grand Gateway mall across the street is really nice and has some dining options.We took the number 3 airport bus and then a short taxi ride to the hotel - cost 58 rmb for 2 people. Returning a taxi to Longyang rd and the MagLev to PVG cost 150 rmb for 2. These were 2 rather inexpensive options traveling between the airport and the hotel. We found all the staff very welcoming and helpful. They really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. We were in Shanghai for 3 nights for sightseeing. The hotel is a bit out from the main attractions, but in a city of 20 million is was nice to be a bit off the beaten path. We can recommend this hotel and the staff and think they are off to a great start. Did I mention we were there in the middle of the Chinese New Year Celebration!!! Very loud and colorful, something to see.If you are looking for a nice new hotel with a good staff book the Courtyard Shanghai Xujiahui for your next trip to Shanghai. Nov 14 2021 	????????????"
"Nov 20 2021 	Loved the Hotel	Crowne Plaza Century Park is one of the best hotels tostay in Pudong area. This place is ideal for business travellers because of the proximity of New shanghai International Expo centre and the Pudong Expo center both are about 5 mins from the Hotel.Almost everybody in the Hotel either speaks or understand English which makes it very convieneient to talk to the Concierge to get around the place.There is a near by shopping area called the Thumbs plaza which has a great ambience and athmosphere. There are several international food chains like the Pizza hut , Subway and also several bars and Pubs including the very comfy and laid back Irishmans Pub. The Irishmans pub is run by Deaglan a very friendly guy who has a steady group of Expats visting the Pub.There are also some cheap joints to have food including some Chinese and Indian restaurants.Overall its a lovely location and and a very good hotel to stay. Nov 17 2021 	OK but Renaissance next door is better. The breakfast buffett is poor	This is a good location depending on what you are in town to do. It's quieter than some of the more &quot;downtown&quot; locations and if you are willing to walk 1 km or so, there are restaurants and stores nearby, as well as the MTR that can take you to downtown quickly and efficiently. This hotel feels dated. I stayed at this place and the Renaissance next door and the Renaissance is much better. Nov 4 2021 	Nice hotel good location great ammenities but a bit pricey	I stayed in this hotel in April of 2021 and it was a very good experience. The rooms are beautiful and offer very nice views of the Pudong area with the Financial District off in the distance. The service is excellent, the rooms are a bit pricey but they are very spacious and very modern and the bed is &quot;too comfortable&quot; and if you are not careful it's very easy to over sleep :-)If you have access to the &quot;club level&quot; then they offer exceptional services for business meetings, no charge for computer access or printing and there are meeting rooms available as well as a great breakfast buffet. All included in your room charge.The fitness facility and pool look great, but sadly enough I did not get to use them.I would say that the Chinese Restaurant on the 3rd floor is probably one of the best in the city, the food is outstanding and service is excellent. And the lobby restaurant is very good too.The Subway station is a short 4 block walk across Century Park (below the Museum of Science &amp; Technology) and there is also an amazing market place in this subway station that offers incredible deals on all sorts of merchandise ranging from clothing, to electronics, purses &amp; bags you name it. I highly recommend taking time to visit the Science &amp; Tech Museum if you can and definitely try to spend some time in that market place (often referred to as the &quot;Fake Market&quot; by the locals.The only draw back to this hotel is that if you are opposed to using the subway system then the cab ride across the river into Shanghai will take about 30-40 minutes so getting over to the Bund, Nanjing Rd, or XiTangDi will take some time. But other than that this place is great and I really recommend the hotel.Joseph SlobodaFort Lauderdale, FL Oct 16 2021 	Not more than average	Stayed here a total of 6 nights, stayed on an executive room with access to the club lounge on the 25th floor. The hotel has some good restaurants, although I did not like the Heji restaurant on the 3rd floor. It felt too formal for its clientel, and the waiters were uninterested at best. Breakfast at the club lounge was boring, not much to tempt you in the morning. The evening buffet was actually better.Club level benefits were ok, nothing special, but some of the staff were quite nice and remembered my preferences well. Front desk staff were all business, not much smiles or personal service there.Rooms felt quite old because of the decor, and the bathroom I had was huge without really making smart use of the space. Showers took too long to become hot. Bed was good though.Fitness facilites were good, and the location is decent, although you have to walk a while to find decent shops and restaurants.All in all it was a experience that will not last, and I doubt I would choose this hotel again when there are so many others in Shanghai to choose from. Jun 23 2021 	Good Choice	To me this hotel is just right, it is a no frills hotel that offers everything I need jsut at the standards that I need them. Location is in a nice spacious quiet area of Shanhai( which is not easy to find). I enjoy this neighborly quiet part of town. You can stroll to century park or walk down a couple pf blocks to a shopping mall. Room are well fitted and appointed, bathroom spacious with windows. thi will be my new regular home when Im in Shanghai. Jun 22 2021 	Good Hotel in a Good Location - 4 1/2 Stars	Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Century Park hotel for 4 nights the beginning of June. The hotel is very new and the rooms are large. Service was excellent and the food good. It is a three block walk to a shopping area with Carrefour and numerous restaurants. I would recommend and stay again. Mar 26 2021 	Very good hotel excellent value.	This hotel was chosen based upon reasonable transit to the Airport, coupled with value. The price I got through a website was unbelievable and I expected an average hotel - it turned out to be an excellent hotel in all respects - rooms, service, food, check-in service and location. In addition, you could get to the airport easily (40 minutes) using subway &amp; Maglev, or ('excitingly') a taxi for all or part of that journey. The location was very friendly for walking/jogging as there is a huge park nearby, wide streets etc. Not a great base for exploring the &quot;old&quot; Shanghai center, the Bund or general shopping but I will certainly stay here again whenever I need to overnight before a flight. Feb 3 2021 	Very Nice experience	Stayed here for 5 nights while attending an exhibition in Shanghai.I was upgraded to a club room. Club room had plenty of room, nicely decorated and a lovely bathroom.The club lounge is superb.Within walking distance of the Hotel there is a rather nice outdoor complex of bars,restaurants and shops that seem to have been built to cater to expats.Generally the area around the hotel is very peaceful and somewhat tranquil.Great for walkingService at the hotel was excellent .I will be staying here again in January 2021 for sure. Jan 11 2021 	Value for money	I am visiting Shanghai almost once a month and have, of course, tried many hotels in this city.Among the hotels in the Pudong district that I have stayed with for the last four-five years this is the best if you look on value for money.Very new and fresh, big beds and a nice bathroom make it an excellent choice.If you plan to visit Shanghai Exhibition Centre there is a free bus from the hotel in the morning and back again in the afternoon for every single exhibition all year round.The staff is “new” (as the hotel it self) and very keen to making your stay a comfortable one. Their understanding of English is over average compared to other hotels I have stayed with in Shanghai. It’s, in my experience, very rear that the bell-boy can have a meaningful chat with you in the elevator going up to your room.There is one restaurant on the ground floor operated by the hotel, which serves buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is, in my opinion, to expensive, but the food is good.On the third floor there is an independent Chinese restaurant (belonging to a chain as far as I know) which offers a traditional Chinese lunch or dinner. It is a huge restaurant with many separate rooms and several open areas with a lot of tables for two to six-seven people. I don’t know so much about this restaurant chain, but if you like Chinese food this restaurant will give you value for your CNY for sure! A dinner for three with tree-four dishes and two-three bottles of beer is a mere 150 – 200 CNY.On the 25th floor there is a lounge for those staying in Club rooms. They serve complimentary breakfast, beverages all day and drinks and snacks in the early evening. Nice area which will give you value for the extra 2 – 300 CNY you have to pay for a Club room per night.The close surroundings are mostly offices (Pudong local government is one) and flats. There are several small restaurants, a video shop, two bars, a massage parlour, a barbershop and two Family Marts close by. The area is quite popular among expatriates and you can meet many Europeans in the bars on weekends.For more serious shopping it’s only a short walk to Thumbs Plaza with many shops including Carrefour.For not so serious shopping it is a short walk to the copy market underneath the Science and Technology Museum. This is one place where you can try out your negotiating skills. Century Park, Shanghai’s largest park, is also within walking distance.A taxi to Times Square, Pudong (close to Intercontinental Hotel on Zhangjang Lu) is about 15 CNY and the same number of minutes. Here you will find several electronic markets and department stores with all international brands. There are also a large number of good restaurants in this area. The restaurants are not so easy to find though. Many are located several floors up and you have to be able to read Chinese signs or ask someone for the way to find them. Highly recommended is a small Sichuan restaurant in Thomson Business Centre ground floor for those who like spicy food and an authentic environment. I have never seen any Europeans in this restaurant over the years.If it’s your first trip to Shanghai or if you are a regular, Crown Plaza, Century Park is a really good hotel and can be highly recommended. Nov 16 2008 	Very Gem in a quiet and peaceful area of Pudong	I was on a business trip on Shanghai and decided to try out this brand new Crown Plaza. I am very happy with my decision. This is a very nice hotel with great hotel room that has a big bathroom.Breakfast is good with a great selection of warm and cold food. The buffet dinner is well priced for the selection that it has to offer. Hotel staff are friendly and extremely helpful and service is very fast. It is about 15min by cab away from the bustling luJiaZui area and for some reason I feel that the air fresher and colder in this region. Within 2min walk there is a whole strech of shophouses which includes resturants (korean, Japanese, Chinese, Pubs), massage, hair salon, pharmancy, convience store etc (very convinence)Infact I have such a great massage that we have been having massage almost daily :)If you are on the executive floor then you will enjoy the large and well-designed lounge on the 25 floor of the hotel. They offers free tea (organic tea) and coffee throughout the day. I have been using this to host my business counterpart and this is a great place for serious business discussion. Infact there is even a meeting room (I think for 10pax at least) that you can rent if required. Do note that you can only bring in 1 additional guest FOC to the executive lounge at any one time.The indoor swimming pool is a bit small but is great for a dip. Following that you can have spend sometime in the jacuzzi followed by a sauna session, ideal relaxing if you have 1hour to spare ! (All these will close by 11pm so do be there early)Some of my other friends who have seen the hotel has already make this their must stay hotel in Pudong.For me, this is definitely my preferred hotel in Pudong Jul 28 2008 	Value and Comfort in Shanghai	This hotel only recently opened. The staff was courteous, though the front desk staff did need to be reminded to fulfill some requests. The location wasn't perfect, but it was 1km from Thumb Plaza, a wonderful restaurant location. The bed was comfortable and rooms were clean. The gym had most everything you would need. The air conditioning was loud. It was a nice business hotel. Apr 11 2021 	Ottima sistemazione"
"Oct 31 2021 	Good Price w/ standard	Not a convenient location, however, you can find many restaurants along Panyu Road. Room is clean w/ standard faciliites. The room price is very ok but Internet is charged at RMB 120 / day. Oct 25 2021	Crown Plaza Fudan Shanghai	This hotel is excellent for large tour groups like SmarTours. We stayed three nights. Great buffet breakfasts. Rooms are large and very clean. Only disadvantage is distance to the center of town. Since we were in a group, we were bussed to the attractions. A taxi would be required otherwise. Next year the city is hosting Expo 2020. Lots of construction in progress right now including a rebuild of the Bund. Would suggest waiting till after the Expo for a visit. Oct 1 2021 	Luxury Hotel	One of the best hotels Ive ever stayed in. I stayed here for a month I was in Shanghai with work. All parts of the hotel are top class. You can chose from 4 different Breakfast ranges, Chinese, Japanese, European and American. Hotel food was best in Shanghai but came at a high price. If you have the money or if your goighere o business its the only option. Jun 7 2021 	Exotic Shanghai	I have stayed in there Pudong property, it's a lovely 5 star property in the out-skirts of Shanghai. Very close to free trade zone. Excellent value for money May 12 2021 	Good Hotel has all the regular features of a solid business hotel	I stayed here for two nights (May 8-9, 2021) on a business meeting. This also happens to be the crew hotel for several major airlines.The first thing I like about this hotel is it's location. It's very easy to get a taxi (doorman will get it for you) and there are plenty of small to medium sized restaurants nearby that feature both chinese, western and other international fare.Check-in was easy and efficient. My bags were taken right to my room by an attendant. The hotel was in good repair and I didn't see any visible signs of wear and tear or things that were not functioning.. One of my favorite things about the whole check-in experience is that beautiful red fabric back-drop that is to the rear of the front desk.. very beautiful and elegant..My room was fairly large well equipped. It had all the features you'd expect.. a large desk, internet access is available in the room (at a charge), full international TV, coffee/tea maker, iron, etc. Nice big bathroom with tub/shower combo. Everything in the room was clean and nothing was broken or inoperable.As for the hotel itself, it has a large healthclub right on the premesis-- for a small charge-- pool, sauna, exercise machines, etc.. You could get a full workout here without missing anything.. There is also a fully equipped and staffed business center on-site. Computer rental, internet access, printing, mailing, faxing, translation, etc.. you need it-- they'll get it done.. There are three restaurants as well.. of course the requisite main chinese restaurant, a western/international cafe, a coffee bar with small pastries and sweets, plus a quasi sportbar-like place that offer lighter fare and drinks.. However, in my opinion, in a town like Shanghai, that is arguably famous for its cuisine, you really should take the risk and explore the cities diverse culinary side..My room was prepaid on a company account, so I can't speak to the rate. The service from the hotels' staff was friendly enough.. My one complaint-- such that it is-- is the staffs' lack of what I call &quot;forward thinking&quot;.. for example, I take my first cup of coffee with cream. If I ask for a refill of coffee, I would expect that the server either bring a cream/sugar offering (assuming s/he remembers my initial serving) or would ask &quot;would you care for cream or sugar?&quot;.. that may seem trivial, and on the surface it is, however, I use is as an illustration as to what I mean by &quot;forward thinking&quot;.. anticipating the guests needs-- before s/he ask.Overall, I'd rate this hotel very good for it's ammenities, room features and cleanliness.. While the level of high(er) end hotels has literally expanded like 10-fold in the past several years-- and the bar is now very high-- I still like this hotel.. it retains some local shanghai flavor without becoming just another gigantic, sterile, business hotel... and the location is very good for walking around and exploring. Apr 9 2021 	Good as usual	Stay there very often. Service on the exec lounge seems to depend on the people, some crews are very good, other talk among each other so loud that the guests cannot talk to each other. Rooms are nice, bathrooms quite small, but OK, no separate shower unfortunately.Nice job they have done in redesigning the lobby. Just missing the Italien restaurant.Overall - great Jan 17 2021 	Poor sound insulation	1.Sound insulation is very bad between rooms. I could clearly hear the person in the rooms next to me not to mention the TV, going to the toilet etc.2.Strange vibration through the room sometimes like a boom car is passing very annoying – maybe a train, or a cinema but I couldn’t figure it out but it was there and I was on the 22nd floor.3.Room was very cold when I arrived, outside temperature was 0 celcius and the room about 10 celcius. Put the heating on high and it took about 6 hours to get the room warm.4.Taxis are a problem – I had read in other reviews and I didn’t think this would be a problem but it becomes one when you stand in a line out in the cold and wind for half and hour waiting for the bellboys to wrangle up a taxi.5.High pressure sales to upgrade when you book-in that I have never experienced in a hotel before – quite strange but be ready for it.6.Internet very good.7.Room service not bad.8.Staff ok but a little controlling but then again this is China.9.Kettle in room which was great.10.Very clean but sterile rooms.11. The room was not good value also they slipped in a donation to Project Hope in the final bill - I hate hotels that do this. Also, I was silly enough to agree to a room upgrade at checkin but I wasn't thinking straight as I had been on a plane for 38 hours. Did the booking on the internet and then they charge a 15% what i think is a service charge(I'm pretty sure this is not a tax but just a way to charge more without you being aware when you do the booking.)Cost were Package rate per night Cyn 959Room Revenue Svc++ Cyn 144Project Hope Cyn 5Room Upgrade Cyn285Room Upgrad Svc Cyn 43Internet Cyn120Cost per day Cyn1,556 Sep 29 2018 	A godd Hotel	I spent 8 days at The Crown Plaza Shanghai, and chose this Hotel as it was close to places I intended to visit during my stay. The Hotel is not located in the Toursit area and is about a half hour cab ride to The Bund and main shopping area of Shanghai (Nanjing Road).The rooms were modern, quiet and very clean. I found all the Hotel staff very helpful and friendly. The Restaurants in the Hotel are OK, breakfast is the usual buffet, but I found the lunch and dinner menus did not have large choice of food. There are a lot of small independent restaurants close by, and a couple of good massage places to have cheap foot massages, a must after walking all day. Overall a very enjoyable experience. Aug 28 2018 	Decent Business Hotel	Compared to a few other hotels I've had to stay in Shanghai, the Crowne Plaza is a good selection.The location is in a fairly quiet street, near Huating Lu, good for shopping. I was not able to check any of the services the hotel offered, as I was mostly in and out of the hotel late/early, as my schedule was tight.I had a deluxe room, which was nice but average - the best thing was that I could open the window, not very common in high-rise 4* hotels, so I was able to turn off the aircon and grab some fresh air.The restaurant serves a decent buffet and some a la carte, although the service is a bit slow and clumsy. Breakfast also offers the standard fare and the overall price (around 100€ all inc) is a good deal for what is offered.The only drawback was the awful processing of my check out. It took them almost 15min to get my bill printed and, although I had pointed it out, that I neeeded it invoiced to my company, they got it wrong TWICE.NOTE: The KLM airline crews also stay here. Jun 29 2018	Better Than Expected	We stayed at this hotel as part of a group tour of China. I was a little concerned about staying here at first, because on a map it seemed kind of far from the places we'd want to visit in Shanghai (i.e, museums, the Bund, the Pudong area, and the Old Town). One of the advantages, though, of going with a tour group, is that the tour company provides a driver, and although this hotel is too far from downtown to walk there, it took us no time to get there with our driver or by taxi. The location turned out to be pretty convenient actually -- there are number of little restaurants and shops in the area, a convenience store around the corner, a really good gelato shop two doors down, and an ATM right across the street. The other fun thing about this hotel is that some of the elevators have glass backs to the outside of the building, so you can get a view of the area on your way to and from your room. The business center is really nice and open late, which is convenient. The breakfast is good, serving both eastern and western breakfast foods, although the selection was somewhat limited compared to other hotels we used on this trip. The rooms were nice, and the beds were comfortable. Apr 2 2018	Pretty Good Hotel	Intro- I have stayed at this hotel during many visits since 2005. Due to my changing work locations, I just stuck to the &quot;old formula&quot; of staying in a familiar location.Location and Logistics- This specific Crown Plaza is situated on a secondary road (Pan Yu Lu) which connects to the Yanan Elevated Road (S). - It is in an almost central location, in an area which is quite accessible to some of Shanghai's main sites.- It is however a problematic place to stay if you want to regularily commute in and out during morning or evening rush hour. The reason is because Pan Yu Lu is a 2 way-single lane road with medium range shops on either side.Rooms and Design- Rooms are quite spacious. They are equipped with the usual standard stuff like a Safe, Kettle, (nice) Toiletries etc- Internet is available but at a charge.- The Design is quite nice to the eye as well - good tan/brown shade finishes which make a cold day outside feel nice from inside.- They have a good range of TV Programmes as well.- The lobby of the hotel is so-so. The Breakfast area in the morning can get a bit crowded in the morning but the food is good and always fresh.Service/Safety- This is a good secure hotel with pretty stiff security and CCTVs all over the place.- The checkins can get slow sometimes since the hotel hosts regular flight crews which means bottleneck checkins at usually 2 counters working simultaneouly.Amenities- Theres a coffee shop run by the hotel just outside called Star walk Cafe. With a Starbucks opened up nearby, thats a plus for &quot;fast food&quot; type coffee lovers.- I haven't checked the gym or pool but I was told its pretty good.- The hotel actually shares a compound with a large cinema hall as well!Opinion/Pros/Cons- Pan Yu Lu can be a tight slow moving road at rush hour. It may even make your arrival time from airport extend by 30 mins! Total commute time from Pudong Airport in a taxi is around 90 minutes.- The hotel at night is not really in a very hip or trendy area with much nightlife around and its not a walk away from the famed Nightspot Tongren or Heng Shan Road.- Pan Yu Lu is however a very 'fully equipped' road with all kinds of shops for shopping medium range products like a range of clothes/DVDs/restaurants which are open at normal hours. This includes a 'legal' massage place suitable for all family members across the road.- The hotel is situated at a spot which is quite close to the Xui Jia Huai Shopping intersection and good distance from the Jiangan Temple (by Taxi).- Overall the hotel is a nice stay and quite comfortable but as someone mentioned...its a bit boring for some reason. It may be well packed with visitors but somehow still doesnt &quot;rock&quot; or isnt memorable.Cheers Mar 29 2018 	Good hotel so-so location...	Both the service and the rooms at the hotel were good. The location of the hotel is in more of a residential district. It surrounded by several shops and restaurants which was convenient, but since it is not in the &quot;touristy&quot; parts, you will need to know some basic mandarin to get by. Mar 21 2018 	Basic. Clean. But boring.	I booked online so I could be with some business associates I had come to meet. I booked online and got a fantastic &quot;weekend package&quot; deal including breakfast for US$ 110 so very worth the priceThe rooms are large, clean, well stocked (toilet prodcts, mini bar etc) but the hotel advertises a Japanese restaurant, Charlies bar etc ... however ONLY the one Crowne Restauarant and very small lobby bar. So if you are looking for a busy hotel with many options dont expect that. Ify ou just want a central Shanghai well-located place; sure this is good as a base for business meetings etc Also if you ae here for tourism this is not the hotel as not walking distances from the bund or other major sights. Feb 18 2018 	a impressed hotel during my trip to China	during the last Chritmas' and New Year's holiday, I traveled to China with my families. Booked by my Chinese friend, the Crowne Plaza Hotel offered an excellent services to us which gave us a memorable impression. The staffs are very friendly to our foreigners, in particular, some of them can speak English such fluently as they could answer my any request in English. The services are value-added in terms of its lower price. I wish I could enjoy their services next time when I have opportunity to China again. Feb 14 2018 	A good face-lift	My recent stay in new renovated Crown Plaza Shanghai was a wonderful experience. Booked through hotel directly with a resonable rate because of the winter pomotion, efficient check-in as usual. It's not a new hotel but staff is very friendly and willing to help you wheneven you need. Room is nice and clean, with all facility and space you expect for a crown plaza room. Only one thing I may suggest is a bigger plasma TV which is becoming standard for most new hotels in Shanghai.The most impressed is the renovated lobby area, It really give the hotel a better image when you step in. Reception told me hotel is building new club rooms next door, hopefully I can try it next time I visist shanghai since crown plaza is my favrorit hotel in town Nov 26 2007 	Needs some work	I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza a number of times over the last few years and have to say some of the rooms are starting to look quite tired and shabby.I was initially put in a room (on the sixth floor) with very little furniture and quite a threadbare carpet. I had to contact reception to get international dialling on the telephone. After an hour of incessant noise which sounded like it was coming from renovation work on the floor above, I complained and was moved without a fuss to a much better room on the 18th floor.The reception staff are all very pleasant and check-in and out is very efficient.Eating in the hotel is not recommended as the standard of food is not brilliant. Admittedly we went for mainly western food but even so I would have expected better.The lobby, bar and restaurant areas are due for rennovation later this month (Nov 2007). And judging by my experience some of the rooms are currently being refurbished. However with the choice and standard of similar hotels in Shanghai, the Crowne Plaza needs to improve. Sep 27 2007 	Cut short my stay and moved for good reasons....	This was my most unfortunate stay with an Intercontinental Hotels chain property around the world. My stays at the China Holiday Inns have been much better. And of course, the Intercontinental Hotel stays have been great to exceptional.The check-in was ok, upgraded to a deluxe room, which was not deluxe in any sense. It was a very dated (early 1990s designed) room, nothing special or deluxe about it. I cannot fault the room for providing a quiet place to sleep on a western-style bed. However, if you are expecting more hospitality, go elsewhere.The staff is, well, just not trained in the IC chain style. Smiles and greetings are sparse and efficiency is lacking. One of the biggest faults is the lack of taxis. As many Shanghai travelers know, a taxi is generally a cheap, easy and mostly fast way to get around. This hotel is at least one km from the closest subway station, so you cannot fall back on public transport for a quick trip.The hotel was designed with no taxi queue! There is no place for taxis to park and wait for the lucrative fares coming from an &quot;upscale&quot; hotel. I talked with several taxi drivers, through an interpreter, and they said the hotel is too inconvenient for them to regularly service. Hence, the only taxis are those which are dropping off passengers. If there are no dropoffs, there are no cabs. This is a &quot;business meeting&quot; type of hotel, with many people lining up at once to get a taxi. One afternoon at 4 p.m., I waited for 20 minutes until I gave up and began to walk the streets. The hotel sent some bellcaps out to the street to lure in taxies, but they were passive. If you have ever seen the effort some doormen put out to find a taxi, you will laugh at this Crowne Plaza's attempt. A complaint to the front desk got indifferent shoulder shrugs and little effort to satisfy the guest for a basic hotel service. Translated loosely into English their (several front desk people) body language said, &quot;So what's new?&quot; For a traveler accustomed to warm Chinese hospitality, this place was cold as ice.I suffered from sticker shock on the internet charges of 120 yuan (over US$15 a night). This is the highest charge I have seen after maybe 20 hotel stays in China in the past 18 months. (Many are free, of course.) The breakfast buffet, for those not getting a &quot;free&quot; breakfast, was about 175 yuan per person, over $23 at today's exchange rate. Breakfast for two at the Crowne Plaza=almost US$50. It was not a spectacular spread, and they advertised their dinner buffet at the same price. It is price gouging to charge so much to guests looking for a western breakfast. (For China, the US$50 can buy a wonderful dinner for two at a white-linen restaurant.)Many times I pick up the &quot;vibes&quot; of a place, good or bad, upbeat or depressing. This property had sufficient negatives in convenience and costs that I checked out after two nights of a planned five-night stay. When checking out, no one asked why I was checking out early, if I enjoyed my stay, or gave me a comment card. Perhaps if they would solicit feedback from their customers, they would find out why it is not a hospitable place to stay. Aug 4 2007 	Average at the Crowne Plaza	We spent 6 nights at the Crowne Plaza Shanghai in early July 2007. We had just stayed at another Crowne Plaza in November 2006 on the Pudong side, so we thought we knew what to expect. It is a long ride to and from Pudong airport, so prepare for that when planning your stay. It is about 20RMB by taxi to central Puxi. First impression of the hotel was all right, but upon inspection it looks tired and worn everywhere, including the hotel band. We were on business and we had club level rooms booked. The rooms were ok, nothing to brag about and especially not the club-level I expected, quite small, worn out and the view was terrible. The club lounge was also a little tired and what surprised us the most was that there were no windows in the lounge. We ate at the hotel Chinese restaurant, which was quite good, but there are better and cheaper choices even on the other side of the road, just turn right and cross the street. We had a few beers at the hotel bar Charlies, nothing to tell our grandchildren about, very loud music by a terrible band and the price of beer was astronomical by any standards, a pint of local beer costing about 55RMB! Breakfast was fairly all right, but limited in choices.What upset me was that they charged one of us 134Euros directly from the credit card with no explanation, which we only noticed when we got back. Still trying to get an explanation, but so far no answers... Overall, not terrible, but not good either and the last part didn't help either. The Crowne Plaza on the Pudong side was so much better, but sooooo far away. Will be staying at another hotel chain the next time. Nov 11 2006 	Great staff fine hotel	This Crowne Plaza, one of three in Shanghai, is actually quite out-of-the-way on a back street off one of Shanghai's main shopping streets (although all the shopping is a couple of miles down the road at the other end). There is no Metro stop close by, which would make things difficult except for the plentiful supply of cabs, which are very cheap. Do be sure your driver knows where he's going though - some in Shanghai don't seem to be aware of the basic tourist spots! Inside, it's a comfortable international business class hotel, with several restaurants and bars. I recommend you book a room on the club floor for the extra space and comfort, the dedicated breakfast area and the priority check in on the upper floors. The room itself had a decent bathroom and was large with a comfortable bed. The internet connection was fairly slow, despite claiming to be 100 Mbps, but the TV stations were a good mix of CNN, BBC, some movie channels, etc. My real memory of this hotel will be the exceptionally helpful and friendly staff, however. I was unfortunate enough to be the victim of a crime in Shanghai (nowhere near the hotel, I should add), and two of the staff went out of their way to help me, accompanying me to the police station, translating for me, and generally reassuring me. I couldn't have thanked them enough, and highly recommend this hotel on the basis of those staff. It's a comfortable base, and a pleasant refuge from the bustle of this electrifying city. Incidentally, the crime I was the victim of occurred on Nanjing Road close to the Bund. It seems, from my research afterwards, that many others have suffered similar experiences in Shanghai. A man approached me on a Sunday afternoon and asked me to help him speak English. This happens a great deal in China. I resisted, but he seemed genuine and in need of assistance. I accompanied him to his choice of venue: an Egyptian bar off Nanjing Road, near the top end by the Bund (which he assured me was a coffee house, but was clearly, on entering, a red light bar). This resulted in me being asked for sex by prostitutes, and when I refused being presented with a bill for nearly 3000 Yuan (around 250 GBP) for drinks they falsely claimed the girls had consumed. I was threatened by male bouncers and not allowed to leave until I paid up. I did so and left, after which I called the police. If you are a vicim of crime in Shanghai, always call the police on 110. They were really helpful, found a translator for me over the phone, visited my hotel room, and eventually took me back to the bar where they got me most of my money back. The police take these crimes very seriously and will be helpful. Two further tips: don't speak to anyone on Nanjing Road, and avoid the Egyptian Bar just off the main street. It's full of appalling criminals.Enjoy the rest of Shanghai, though: it's a great city. May 4 2006	Better than ever	I was a regular visitor to this hotel until they began the renovation work a couple of years or so ago when the daytime noise became too annoying. Having tried other hotels such as Sofitel and Hua Ting in the meantime, I was relieved to learn that the work was completed and I had no hesitation in returning for a short stay in April 2006. The rooms and service are up to the best Crowne Plaza standards and good value (at least for Shanghai) at about USD 120 per night ,particularly with the upgrade I usually enjoy as a Priority Club member.Although a bit out of the way from the main shopping and business areas, it is located in a very quiet and pleasant neighbourhood with lots of nice restaurants within walking distance. In fact if you don't like hotel breakfasts there is an excellent cafe with Chinese and Western dishes immediately next door by the cinema complex.If you don't fancy long taxi rides through the Shanghai traffic it is simpler to get a taxi for a 5 minute trip to the Xujiahui shopping area (several large stores and shopping mall) where there is a fast subway service to Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road shopping districts.Unless you have a lot of business in Pudong area I would recommend this hotel to anyone - it is also very close to Hongqiao Airport which is much more convenient for domestic flights than Pudong Airport. Jan 4 2006	Good value nice place	We stayed at this hotel for 9 nights. We paid $81/nt for a single king bed and in advance. When we got there inspected this room, it was fine but, we paid an extra $25/nt and upgraded to a better king room with many extras including one breakfast(only one, regularly about $20, and not that good. if you are with someone else, you will probably eat on the street), free happy hour, 2 shirt pressing/day, 23rd floor usage where the happy hour room was located, internet, free drinks, good snack foods and a meeting area. It was worth it to upgrade, especially since even at $100 is cheap for a nice hotel. We used the business office twice but they are not very helpful, but they try. I wanted to locate a company but they had no idea what how to help or did not understand?? There is construction going on in the hotel but not near our room and I heard a hammer occationally in the lobby. While I was at the counter, a visitor was complaining about the noise, so they just moved her to another room. Over all the price and the service is a good value. The location is the French concession where there are good places to eat and places to see. Across the street is a good place for massage (one hour is RMB 70). Feb 3 2005	horrible construction work!	I stayed at Crowne Plaza in Shanghai in December 2004 with my mother-in-law. I have often chosen Crowne Plaza hotels in Asia, because usually the price/quality ratio has been relatively good. However, this time I was very disappointed because there was a big room construction work going on, and we got our room just below the construction work. The noise was just terrible and plaster was falling from the ceiling. I immediately called the reception and asked if we could change the room (after 8 hours' flight + jet lag you need to rest). The change was not possible, we had to wait for the next day!!I fully understand that construction work have to be done sometime, but there should be a warning at the hotel website (in this case the work was done betw. 8:30-18:00 so it didn't disturb those who were on a business trip, but for tourists it was a nightmare). Additionally, the german girl at the reception just said that &quot;the walls are so thin nothing can be done&quot; - that did not make us feel any better! They could have given discount, free dinner or something.But there was a lot of positive things as well, both rooms were newly renovated and kept very tidy, breakfast was very nice (+ lot of variety) and there were a lot of shops &amp; restaurants in the neighbourhood of the hotel.Transportation to shopping streets takes time, the ring road was congested and it took 20 mins to walk to the nearest subway station. Jan 9 2005	A Good Value 4 star	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in November 04. It was very busy at the time but at check in they still managed to find me a non-smoking room which my agent had forgotten to request. The hotel, although not new, had attractive decore and was extremely well maintained with every amenity expected for its 4 star rating. My room was also attractive, spacious and very well appointed with efficient air conditioning and good tea and coffee making facilities. The room service and breakfast were also of very good quality. My only criticism was its position on the western side of the CBD but nevertheless, it was a very pleasant area with some interesting shops and restaurants nearby. If you dont mind not being central it offers good value for a 4 star property and I'd definitely recommend it and stay there again. Jan 21 2021 	?????????? Jan 3 2021 	Pulito e confortevole"
"Oct 25 2021 	Nice hotel but to be avoided by tourists	Nothing wrong with this hotel. nice rooms and good breakfast. However if you are visting Shanghai you should not stay there. This hotel is targetted for business travelers who have business there not for tourists. There is nothing to do or see around there. You can walk to the subway (10 minutes) but the ride to Nanjing Road will take an hour. If you take a taxi to the key places in Pudong that will cost you over 70rmb each time. This hotel is not to be confused with the other Crowne Plaza which is also in Pudong but is better located. Sep 23 2021 	location is a big problem	Stayed one night here , 15% surcharge, and needed to pay 98rmb for the internet to check emails. There are many alternatives that are much closer to the city.The location is the main problem, The tea and coffee canister was empty which I am sure they would have replenished in no time. The staff were profesional,polite and helpfull. Room was what you would expect, served a nice meal but nothing out side this hotel in terms of food alternatives or shopping that we could find. Jul 23 2021 	Nice Hotel.... Nice food!	This is a nice hotel, located in a clean area of Shanghai.... A supermarket is 5 minutes walk, as is the metro stop, The hotel shuttle will take you to the riverside or underground market, the bus fills up quickly! Rooms are very large, will great showers! If you want to use the pool bring a swimming cap.... They are very strict about the cleanliness of the water! Jun 24 2021 	Great Hotel for Value	My wife and two young teenagers stayed here in two rooms next to each other. The rooms were bright and large for standard rooms. The beds were very comfortable soft not hard as the others we had stayed in during our three city China tour. There is plenty of shopping around the hotel if you want to pick up water or soft drinks during your stay. The Metro is a short 15 minute walk next to the Science Museum. I recommend the Metro for travel it is quick and efficient and will take you to all the tourist destinations for 4 RMB per person. The taxis are great they are real cheap and start at 11 RMB when you get in. We took the taxi one night to YuYuan Gardens for 21 RMB, that's like $3.50. Make sure you tell the driver to use the meter (Fa Bieu). The staff will write down in Chinese and tell the drivers where you want to go. Make sure you have the name of the hotel with you for the return trip. We did not use the amenities offer at the hotel and dined out every night. The rooms are a great value at $136 dollars per night per room. It was still cheaper than staying at a comparable hotel in downtown Shanghai. Jun 18 2021 	Some Jewels missing from this Crowne..!!!	When one is travelling to a new country, especially for business everything has to impeccable and done in style.. And, if it's China then a tad bit handy would be a Mandarin dictionary.. Which I didn't carry as a hotel which terms itself as a 5 - Star would live up to those standards..It did somewhere, but faltered too a bit.. It may learn as the wheel progresses.. The catch up line of Crowne Plaza is 'The Place to Meet' - and, yes it does exude a business atmosphere. But, the hotel is located very much at the extreme end of Shanghai.. So, if you are travelling from the Pudong International Airport - be ready for a trip which excites you initially, as you are in Shanghai and every sight is welcoming. But, as you progress and your tired weary self wants a nap - the taxi seat is not the cushion you need..!!Atlast, you arrive and a friendly staff greets you.. A must need to keep your hotel in the niche.. However, some uppity managers may act a bit skeptical although, you have a confirmed ballroom schedule and the business manager has to be apologetic..The rooms are a treat as one gets to soak away their worries and warm their senses in the bathrobe.. As one works on the schedule, breakfast time flies away every morning.. A sleepy walk, but finally a sumptuous and yummy breakfast greets you..The Congee and the Dimsums were my favourite.. The pancakes with honey and maple syrup just melt away.. while braised mushrooms with the unique flavour of China is a must have..Thus, the king-size breakfast sets the ball rolling for the seminar of my company and the staff is really helpful.. Also, the conceirge deserves a pat on the back for the job well done.. But, sometimes the staff doesn't approach the foreign guests as they have a problem with the English.. However, the Hotel lives up to its stature and despite, the distance it is a Place to Meet..Haibo was there.. Who Haibo..? find out.. A blue-fellow who likes to wave a Hi.. Dec 15 2018 	Great Hotel shame about location!!!	I spent 3 nights here at Crowne Plaza, in December 2018. What a great Hotel!! Friendly staff, very comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast spread, and resonable price rates (about $110 USD)...this Hotel really is good,,,,,,except it a long, long way from Shanghai centre!!Train stop about 8 minutes walk from lobby, gives a 4o minute ride into Century Ave, for 5 RMB,,, thats excellent value. There is also a Hotel free shuttle bus, that I onl used twice, but it took me to the Exhibition Centre, saving a long train journey, or expensive taxi ride, cheers!!Wireless Internet in the Lobby, or pay as you go internet in your room. I would love to stay here again, its just not close enough to Shanghai for me, unfortuantely. However, it does have the train line at the door, and taxis are always waiting to take you as well.. Dec 5 2018 	Great service and breakfast buffet	Great service. Since we were new to this city, we always consulted the concierge who was very helpful. I love the little extras like at night they turn down the bed and replenish the toiletries and drinking water, and fill the ice bucket. Breakfast buffet has very good selection especially the Japanese section and the live cooking. All the wait staff are helpful with one waitress grilling my fish because she could not find the cook. They are eager to please and yet not annoying.The rooms are not tight and the bathroom is nice and both clean. Pillows and blankets were very nice. They even offer a pillow menu to respond to every need, and no extra cost. I wish wifi or free internet connection, even on a limited basis was offered in the rooms. We enjoyed the free wifi in the lobby though. Nov 25 2018	out of the way but nice	My wife and I were part of a tour group to China. We stayed in Shanghai for two nights. This hotel was great. Our standard room with a king size bed was a very good size, very clean and very comfortable. The decor in the room was nice and modern and the bathroom was good as well. It had a tub and separate shower which worked great for my wife because she was able to relax in the tub while I showered. The hotel was beautiful and the gym was very nice for a hotel. It had a number of treadmills/ellipticals and a number of other workout stations that you don't really find in your run-of-the-mill hotel. The pool looked nice although we didn't have time to make it there. This place had the best buffet breakfast out of all the four hotels we stayed in while in China. Being in Shanghai (wonderfully modern city!), this place definitely catered to foreign/business travelers. It's located in the free trade zone and seemed to be close to many business related facilities, but unfortunately very far from any tourist-type places. It usually took at least 40 minutes to get to any of our destinations.Shanghai was a great city though. It was overcast and rainy, which trapped it terrible smog down on the city, but was still a really interesting place. Given more time, I would have loved to explore more. Would consider returning in the future with no particular agenda so that we could just explore. Jun 2 2018 	Good hotel not so good location.	From check in to check out the staff were friendly, efficient and polite. All spoke good English, including those in the Windows Restaurant (no doubt named after its big, er, windows!) where the breakfast buffet was excellent and the other meals I had were also very good. It has the advantage of being open 24 hours, very convenient for the jet lagged business traveler going stir crazy in his room at 2am!In contrast to the light and airy restaurant I found the guest rooms to be a little dark and dingy with rather heavy dark wood furniture and dark cream walls- not to mention the desk chair which was a strange shade of orange.Other hotel facilities include a good gym which is open from 6am to 11pm, a pool and two other Asian restaurants.The hotel location isn't great and it is unlikely to be a location you would choose unless you had a good reason, such as business in the free trade zone across the road. However, there is a metro station only a five minute walk away, taxis are cheap and there is a hotel shuttle bus which will take you to markets and malls several times a day.There are better (and better situated) hotels in Pudong and Shanghai but no doubt being slightly out of the way helps keep costs down and with value for money included in the overall experience this Crowne Plaza earns its above average rating. Mar 18 2018 	Pleasant Stay	I stayed there for 2 nights on a business trip.Room are really nice, just a tiny problem on the shower as not well designed so water goes out to the floor.Enjoyed the stay and considering the hotel rate was really a good deal.Nice atmosphere and good staff. Loved the breakfast buffet.I'll definately go back. Feb 5 2018	pleasant surprise	Went there for a conference so it was a business trip. Hilarious but it was my first time in shanghai and part way through my taxi ride, the driver asked me where teh hotel was!!! ( it was just built a month ago). Hotel was very clean, north american style buffet breakfast was great, didnt really try the lunch or dinner since i was out on the town every day. Room was clean, although shower doors were badly constructed as water just basically dumped onto the floor and by the time you finish theres a flood. Its also out of the way but the city was building a rapid transit station next to the hotel so that issue might be resolved by now. But overall it was acceptable and the price was right. May 20 2006	Worst service ever	We went to this hotel due to a flight cancellation. The check-in staff told us the room was being cleaned &amp; come back in 20 minutes. When we came back we were told no room was available. When we complained no one now spoke English( even though they spoke it before) They offered us a room next door to the hotel &amp; as It was after midnight and raining we took it. The place was a dump, filthy dirty, no fridge, no working airconditioning, bathroom tap broken, no sheet on the bed. We will never stay at a Crowne Plaza Hotel anywhere in the world after this experience. Aug 11 2021 	???????????????"
"Aug 31 2021 	Avoid this hotel - it sucks	Lets start with the negatives: 1) Horrible Location - construction all around the area, noise and disgusting people walking around, smells bad outside, solid 10 minute walk to the train station, food options are crap (just a McDonalds) 2) Beds - Awful, unless you like sleeping on a rock 3) Internet - crap 4) Food - breakfast selection was small and not good 5) Amenities - No pool or gym. 6) Room service - seems to be closed after 11pm...they told us to try McDonalds. Positives: The customer service was excellent, after we complained about the room they upgraded us to a suite, which was marginally tolerable. I advise you not to stay here, look for a hotel closer to the city centre near the bund/TV tower area. Dec 3 2018 	Great hotel	We stayed at the Days Hotel Shanghai in November 2018. A really good hotel, very comfortable and the staff are great. The rooms are really spacious, and the bathrooms are just great - with a bath and a separate shower.We found the glass wall between the bedroom and the bathroom quite funny. We would not have been able to afford this hotel had we booked directly but I do know that the tour agency that we booked through got a really fabulous deal.I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who want a comfortable stay. There is also a hair and beauty salon in the hotel which was very useful.My only problem with this hotel was the location. I would definitely not recommend walking around the neighbourhood at night even though it is right next door to the railway station. It is about a 15 minute taxi ride to the main shopping and tourist spots. Taxis are quite inexpensive though. May 4 2018 	Didn't Love It	Part of the Days Inn chain, the Days Hotel in Shanghai is possibly a bit more modern and upscale than its North American counterpart; however, the location of the hotel left very little to be desired. Located just north of the main Shanghai attractions (the Bund, Nanjing Road, etc), the Days Hotel sticks out like a sore thumb amongst construction rubble. The closest subway station is the Shanghai Railway Station but the walk towards the subway was down an alleyway lined with vomit and reeking of a heavy urine smell. Our room had two double beds, both firm but comfortable. Bedding was white cotton duvets and the room came with two free bottles of water per day. On our first night, we discovered a huge brown, sticky substance on the sheets at the top of the bed by the headboard. The next morning, imagine our embarrassment when our room attendant discovered the stain and looked at us accusingly! We tried our best in broken Chinese to tell her it wasn’t our fault and that it was there when we arrived. She changed the sheets and later that day, we found the same brown, sticky stain on it in exactly the same location! We discovered that the stain was actually battery acid that had been leaking from a flashlight located just above the bed. We brought the flashlight down to the lobby manager and explained to him what had happened. He said he would call housekeeping to get the soiled sheets changed but no one came that night. The next day, new sheets appeared along with a non-leaking flashlight.Breakfast buffet was served on the 3rd floor and it offered both North American and Chinese selections. We had an early departure (5:30am) and the hotel was kind enough to package up a breakfast on the go for us which included a container with two cakes, a bottle of water, a yogurt and an orange.I wouldn’t choose to stay at this hotel again just because we didn’t enjoy the location. It was dank and desolate. The street on the other side of the railway station looked to be more modern and brightly lit but we never ventured there. Apr 11 2018	Loved the Food.	This Hotel is quite close to Shanghai Station but you cannot hear the trains in fact it was very quiet up on th 12th floor.The rooms are superb with every facility available (Razors toothbrushes combs etc.etc.)The in house Restaurants were superb and excellent value.The Concierge were extremely helpful with booking tours,Taxi's,and an evening show which was superb.The surrounding area is about to be redeveloped like a lot of Shanghai but don't be put off by this.This is an excellent Hotel at a very reasonable price.Mick &amp; Jean London Apr 1 2018 	New and modern	Days Hotel is a relatively new and modern hotel located in a mixed residential/commercial area that is some distance to Shanghai's tourist spots like the Bund and the Museum. We stayed there for 3 nights in late February as part of a Smartours group from San Francisco. This hotel is part of the Days Inn franchise.The areas on both sides of the hotel appeared to have recently been cleared so the views from some rooms including ours were not that good. All we saw were plenty of debris but in 3-5 years these areas will have new high rises (same is true in many sections of Shanghai where they are clearing old neighborhoods for redevelopment.) There were restaurants and shops across the hotel including a McDonalds a block away. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood even though some residential areas looked blighted.Our room was standard with 2 full beds. Bathroom was large with a tub (some rooms have see-through baths.) All furnishings were modern including the 27 inch LCD TV and a sophisticated light control switch by the bed. Room had small fridge and complementaries included 2 bottles of water, coffee and tea, slippers, free use of safe and DSL connection. There was a weighing scale (great for checking our luggage weight) plus bathrobes and full bath accessory kit (comb, toothbrush, swabs to go with the lotions and soap). Bed was very firm but OK. Heating was good. Room was comfortable and clean.The reception area was small but functional. We did not have a chance to explore the hotel facilities as we were mostly out on tours. It was interesting that the hotel's top floor was used as storage room rather than a penthouse or a restaurant..Our package included the daily breakfast buffets at the modern styled coffee shop on the third floor. Food was good with a wide variety of American dishes (bacon, sausage, eggs, toasts, cereals, salads, etc.) and Chinese dishes (fried rice, chow mein, pork dishes, dumplings, etc.) with the fruits and juices and an omelet station. We also ate at Ming Garden, the only restaurant in the hotel located on the second floor, and tried a variety of their dumplings and soup which were delicious and cheap ($12 for 2.) The place was empty except for our table and one other table so we have 3 waitresses waiting for us. They could not speak English (as most staff in this hotel except maybe for the clerks at the reception desk and the managers) so nobody warned me about the hot juice in one of the dumplings that squirted and scalded my upper lip (iced it and it was OK.)Because of its location, there was no choice but take a taxi to everywhere. Taxis were cheap ($2-3) but sometimes hard to flag down unless helped by the hotel doorman. Shanghai's traffic was bad and seemed worse than Beijing so a taxi ride could cost more. Shanghai has more rainy days but the hotel provides umbrellas for free use by guests.The hotel's ATM machine did not accept Visa/Mastercard so we had to walk 3-4 long blocks to the right of the hotel past the freeway to find one.All in all, hotel was clean, modern and comfortable and rates are a bargain. We do not mind staying here again. Mar 1 2018	So-so	Stayed here are a part of the Smartours package. This hotel was ok. It is brand new, and to be honest I was expecting more. It is pretty far from any tourist sites, and the immediate surrounding area is pretty desolate (they tore down a bunch of buildings so I assume construction will begin soon to build new sky scrapers). Catching a cab out front was never difficult, and you can always ask the hotel to do it for you. It also wasn't incredibly clean. My pillow had a smudge on it, and the bathroom had patches around the tub and toilet. Good variety of channels on the TV, including about 5 in english. Breakfast was very good, served in a trendy room. They had spring rolls, dumplings, eggs, toast, bacon etc. They did have free in room internet, which was great. Jan 1 2018 	Clean Comfortable...Highly Recommended!	We stayed at the Days Hotel, Shanghai in December of 2007. We wanted a decent location near a metro line, to allow for easy access throughout the metropolis. After looking at several hotels near the Railway Station, we decided this hotel was most favorable...and it didn't disappoint. Front-desk staff was pleasant and the reception area very large, modern and clean. Our rate was 400RMB/night (approx. $70.00 U.S.). You can save a few dollars by booking on Expedia. Other reviewers have commented on the general vicinity not being up to snuff, but I felt safe walking around the hotel. I was never bothered by anyone, and those annoying art students/tea ceremony scammers are nowhere to be found in this area either. Bonus! There are a number of small shops, grocery stores, etc. on the surrounding streets, as well as all the Western regulars (McDonalds, KFC, etc.). Rooms were large, immaculately clean and elegantly furnished. I found the beds to be quite comfortable compared to other hotels I stayed at in China and the bathrooms were especially nice after a long day of walking around Shanghai (beautiful tile work and a variety of good quality toiletries). There are a variety of TV channels, including HBO. Free internet access is provided. There is also a &quot;chocolate lady&quot; who will knock on your door around 6:00pm to hand out bite-size Dove bars to guests. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Oct 16 2007	A very nice hotel	The days hotel is a very nice hotel its still very new ,so everywhere is still very clean.The only complaint I have is the beds they were like concrete, we did ask reception if thay hadsofter matresses in any of the other rooms,the girl behind the desk gave us four more rooms to choose from we found one we thought might be a bit more comfotable but after sleeping on it we discovered it was'nt. The staff were great their englishwas'nt to good but we had no problems, we could always make ourselves understood.The breakfast is not the best I've had but its certainly not the worst.We never had any problems getting to where we needed to go either by taxi or metro which is very near by. Sep 2 2007 	Nice hotel but location not so good	When we first arrived at Days Hotel, I was rather worried that there were no other decent looking buildings around us. The surroundings were a bit run down, mostly small local shops catered to the locals. But I must say, our room turned out to be quite modern and was big enough for 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children). We only encountered one problem during our stay, and that was the toilet was blocked for the 1st night. We also found the air in the lobby to be unpleasant. I suggest anyone wanting to stay here to bear in mind that you will have to take a taxi to just about anywhere you want to go. Taxis are inexpensive. Reception employees do not speak good English but are extremely helpful. Aug 16 2021 	????????????????????? Jan 24 2021 	????????"
"Nov 24 2021 	Great Location - Away from busy streets - Just perfect!	Arrived on a Tueday and stayed in this hotel for 6 nights in the main building in a huge room with 2 double beds. Beds are indeed hard, but after so much sightseeing, etc. you get used to them. Maid service was great. Never had to ask for room to be made up and the front desk service was good too. Breakfast did not come with my room but I ate there a couple of times only out of necessity. It is a buffet which costs about $15 nothing to write home about. For food shopping would recommend the Parkson supermarket next to the subway stop. Would stay there again in a heart beat. For a hotel room well under $100 it was grand. Loved the fact that the hotel also offered free internet. Jun 25 2021 	Good Value location and ambience	Stay in the original building, no: 1 which has a charming old world feel about it. We were upgraded to a larger room, very spacious and quite elegant, Chinese furniture with 2 double beds. If you want to pay more, you can stay in a really beautiful room at the front overlooking the garden. Bathrooms OK, spacious, a little old but hey this is China and we only paid about $110 AUS a night.Staff at reception were helpful. Take or leave the room cleaning - I think that was the attitiude, a lick and a polish! Hotel breakfast was fairly standard, a mix of local and western food. We didn't try the several restaurants at the hotel. The Donghu's in the French Concession area which was a great location, lively with plenty of cafes and shops within walking distance. The hotel has a large indoor pool and gym, which I'd fully intended to use but somehow didn't seem to find the time. I did find time for a massage at the hotel &quot;beauty parlour&quot; - which had a long menu of curious services - and it was great. Worth the couple of extra dollars over the massage shops on the streets. I'd stay here again because it was good value, was authentic traditional Chinese decor and was in a great location.Oh and good free internet access in your room! May 25 2021 	Great rooms great location	Just stayed in Donghu Hotel Main Building. We travel to Shanghai every month for business, this hotel really offers great values for in terms of price/location/quality. Hotel is surrounded by excellent restaurants, and nice streets with small local boutique stores / cafe's/winebars(on Xinle Lu). The rooms are spacey and clean, the main building has a excellent garden, try to book a front on the front side of the building with balcony, You can see the garden. Of course, the hotel resides in a historical building and facilities such as bathromm is a bit old fashioned, but that is absolutely no issue since eveything is very tidy and clean. We travel around the world on monthly basis and we've seen worse hotels in the States nad Europe. DongHu hotel is a great choice! Mar 22 2021 	Construction noise ruined my stay	On the surface the Dong Hu Hotel is nice - large room, large bed, fluffy pillows, new finishes in bathroom. The mattress is hard as a rock but the old hotel has charm. BUT...construction starts under my room early in the morning. There was continuous hammering and drilling. I complained so they moved me to another room. That room was smoky (recirculating other smoker's rooms air) but I decided to live with it. The next week the construction moved to the other side of the building again right under my room. I hear bzz, bzz, bzz, BANG, BANG, BANG non-stop starting from 9:00am. I am staying at the hotel for two months so I ask to speak to the manager. The manager doesn't really address my complaint , looks at his feet , mumbles sorry and says the noise will stop. The noise doesn't stop but continues for another hour until I decide I can't take it anymore and leave my room. It doesn't really bother me this isn't the fanciest place but the unresponsive attitude regarding unacceptable conditions really got to me. Also the &quot;fitness center&quot; has only one exercise bike that no one knows how to use. Mar 6 2021 	Great value and excellent room in Bdg 1 in the French concess	We arrived late and were expected and shown to our room within minutes - a suite overlooking the front garden in Building 1 - at a bargain price. Spacious and well furnished with hard wire internet connection. Walking distance to great shops and easy walk to Metro - anyway a taxi to the Bund is only a couple of US dollars. Good choice of restaurants in easy walking distance and the streets felt very safe...but watch out for bicycles coming from every direction!Really pleased with this hotel, but can understand other comments form people in some of the other buildings which front on to the street as far as we can see.Staff were efficient and friendly. Jan 27 2021	Such a nice place for such a great price	Such a nice place for its value! We stayed here for a week while in Shanghai and upgraded our rooms so that we would stay in the Main building. The prices Expedia gave us were extremely cheap even with the upgrades.When we arrived, we were placed on the 5th floor, very large rooms and everything was furnished with polished dark wood. The king size bed was so comfortable we often slept in without meaning to. We had large windows along two of our walls so we had plenty of light unlike the hotels throughout the rest of our trip. The hotel itself was furnished in the same style and very elegant.We would definately come back to this hotel again if we ever get the chance!The people at the front desk were not the most helpful so make sure you have done enough reserach on your own.Located conveniently in the French Concession so lots of interesting buildings to look at while you wonder. Jan 11 2021 	Cordial Staff and Reasonable Hotel	A nice enough hotel, with a very friendly staff. Be careful on the room selection. The newer addition to the original building (bldg. 1) is very noisy, with thin walls, and loud plumbing and creaky floors. The original building is solid and very nice. Jan 7 2021	Overrated	This was the most expensive hotel we stayed at during our two week holiday in China and unfortunately the most uncomfortable. The mattress was old and sagging; the room was small, dark and noisy. One redeeming feature is the excellent Japanese/Korean restaurant. Worth visiting for the food and architecture but don't bother to stay the night. Oct 31 2018	Garden-like feeling in bustling high rise Shanghai	We stayed in Building 1. There are a series of neighborhood buildings, ours being the most charming. We had a second floor room with a couryard view. Large room high ceilings, Chinese decor in room, with added glass sun room thru the sliding doors. I would have preferred a sofa or club chairs in this sun room as I found it unusable with only a wood table and stools, screen, and large chest. Friends of ours had a room on 5 and they had an open terrace with city views, one might ask for that floor or view. Our bathroom could have used remodelling but our friends room on 5 had new fixtures, a black marble vanity. very generous toiletries and amenities in the bathroom on a tray. Obligatory chinese electric tea kettle in room for instant coffee or tea which is supplied. A caution on the black coffee maker on the counter tho as they consider it mini bar usage and will charge you 18 yuan a day if you use it. Generous breakfast buffet with Asian and Western items. But don't forget to bring your meal voucher with you or they won't let you in ! Very limited seating in lobby, -- Don't sit in coffee bar area in lobby with out ordering or the attendant there will order you to leave ! Very rude, I thought ! A good alternative to Shanghai high rise hotels and a good neighborhood for walking shopping eating. Sep 27 2018 	Very beautiful hotel with nice service and bright smile.	I have been to Shanghai many times and to be in hotels but Donghu is one of the best hotel I have ever been stayed. Overall experience - very satisfied. May 16 2018 	Stayed across the street	The Donghu owns several buildings on this block. One of them is the large luxurious boutique hotel to which it seems most of the reviewers are referring. We stayed at another, which seems to be more targeted towards domestic travelers. I wanted to stay near HuaiHai Road because in the past that's always been my favorite part of town. I used to love how quiet the neighborhood was, the small shops, cafes, and boutiques. Boy have things changed. Well, first about the hotel. We paid about $45/night for the place, so overall I think we got a nice value there. The lobby was small, but professional staff and very friendly. The hallsways were narrow with low ceilings, and the room was quite small-- just big enough for a full sized bed, and small desk table. Flat screen TV on the wall because honestly I don't think any other TV would have fit. Tiny bathroom walled off from the rest of the room with frosted glass was an interesting feature. All in all for the price and for Shanghai I think it's not a bad choice. Now for the neighborhood... I can't say how disappointed I was at the way this area has changed over the past 5-6 years. I went out one evening in search of some fruit and juice, and found nothing by Irish pubs, western dance clubs, and high end boutiques (Coach, Bulgari, Rolex, etc). Was I still in China? Hard to tell. Late night club music permeated the air, and various stragglers and hangers-on permeated the streets. Really disappointing. Anyway, I'll rate it 3-stars since the Hotel itself was a good deal, and the luxury wing did look pretty nice. Apr 18 2018 	Charming hotel in the French Concession!	Just returned from 9 fabulous nights at the Donghu. We had done lots of research and the hotel more than exceeeded our expectations. The rooms are all quite different so it is a good idea to check the room out first. The hallways and public areas are filled with antiques and historic photos of Shanghai. The staff were very helpful, friendly and spoke English. The grounds are beatifully landscaped and well maintained. A large breakfast buffet with about 100 items is available daily. We enjoyed tasting lots of new dishes while we read the complimentary Shanghai Daily News. I am so glad we were staying at the Donghu because it is one of the most classic and charming hotels in Shanghai with all the modern ammenties. Feb 23 2018 	Excellent 4 star villa-style hotel.. with great rooms and excellent service	Hotel has 7 different buildings. Go to the buildings 1 or 7, which are 3 floors buildingsandbelongs before to very rich chinese tycoon. Rooms are large, and well decorated (shanghai style)Efficient business center on 1st floor.Internet WIFI is freeStaff at reception speaking good EnglishHotel is located on the north eastern part of Xuhui district, near Huaihai Zhong Road. website [--] Jan 3 2018 	Donghu Hotel: 2 to 3 star experience	We chose the Donghu Hotel in the French Concession after traveling outside of Shanghai, and after having stayed in a luxury hotel on Nanjing Road. The primary consideration was to be in a less congested area and Donghu was perfect in terms of location. There are many boutiques and restaurants in the area surrounding the hotel.However, the state of the room was sub-par. I read many reviews of hard beds and we experienced it at Donghu. The bathroom set up was okay but there was black mould around the shower stall. The carpet did not look like it was hoovered once during our stay and on one side of the room, there was a gap between where the carpet ended and the wall. The walls were also extremely thin that each time our neighbor's bell was rung, we got up to answer our door. We were too tired to change hotels and suspect that if we had booked a more expensive room (there are many categories at varying price levels), we would have had a much better experience. That said, the staff were polite and tried to help when they could. This property is very much a Chinese-standard rather than an international-standard hotel but if you are not looking for luxury, it would be a fair choice given the surroundings and the polite service. Nov 16 2007 	Great hotel would stay here again.	We stayed at this hotel through a conference my husband was attending. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable, and the service excellent. Breakfast selection was good and included both Chinese and Western style selections. The Donghu is located in a nice neighborhood, and required a cab or subway ride to most sights in Shanghai. This is not uncommon though as Shanghai is a huge sprawling city. Cabs are cheap, and there is a subway stop near the Donghu, but we didn't use the subway ever. Internet access was better than most in China, and also allowed more websites; the general public has less access, and we figured the hotel has increased access because of the large number of foreigners. I would definitely stay here again. Oct 16 2007	Donghu Hotel - French Concession-Shanghai	Just had the privilege of spending 14 days in Shanghai,more particularly at the Donghu Hotel,which is in the French Concession area.Whilst the hotel is not in the glitzy upmarket high rise stakes,we found it to be very comfortable,large rooms,good views of trees,old building and highrises in background-great blend- and it was very quiet.Everything worked and the staff were very accommodating and friendly.This was the No1 building so can't speak for rest of complex.The area was marvellous,lots of little parks,great tree lined streets and busy bustling Huaihai Road round the corner if one is a shopper and wants to do labels or any other shopping .Metros 5 minutes away-but walking to Bund was easy 5k stroll.Think Bund highly overrated and very glad we didn't stay in that area..Lots of good and varied restaurants about.We enjoyed Shanghai far more than we could have imagined and look forward to re-visiting.Leaves Hong Kong for dead. Oct 9 2007	pleasant boutique hotel great location	Posted the following review under the hotel name Donghu Guest House. Nevertheless, its this same hotel, I'm referring to.Stayed here for 3 nites during Sep 2007. It's a cosy boutique hotel, done up in a classic look. Not hip or trendy kind of classic, more towards a basic old fashioned ambience. Thought it could do with a bit more stylish trimmings. Rooms may look a bit barren to some but very clean though. Service by staff was good and I have no complains there.Location is excellent within walking distance to shopping at Huaihai Rd and lotsa food places. Close to French Concession area, which I really like. For its price, its a great hotel for those who prefer a boutique environment. I would stay there again. recommended, Oct 9 2007	pleasant boutique hotel great location	Stayed here for 3 nites during Sep 2007. It's a cosy boutique hotel, done up in a classic look.

It's located in a very vibrant, active and eye opening but friendly and safe neighbourhood. Be adventurous, walk outside of the wrought iron gates and experience the every day life of your Chinese neighbours going about their daily business - especially in the early morning!As for the hotel itself, I have to admit that it wasn't the 4* hotel I was expecting for the price it was charging. A lot of the rooms were under renovation.The first room I had was extremely small, the tap fell off in my hand the first time I turned on the water. I was transferred to another room because they couldn't fix the tap for a day or two. The second room was a bit bigger but the whole time I was at this hotel, the carpet was not cleaned even once - there was lint, threads and other debris all over the floor. The second day, I returned to my room after a meeting and my room hadn't been cleaned at all. I found the housekeeping staff in the hall and asked them to clean it. I was informed that I must put the 'Please make up room' sign on the door knob. There wasn't one! I had to call the Front Desk a couple of times to get bottles of water, coffee and also toilet paper. There was no alarm clock in the room, which is a basic need for travellers though this is not considered a high priority for the Chinese. The staff in the Business Centre could not understand basic English, perhaps the regular girl was off or on a break? However the Front Desk staff was more than proficient.It's unfortunate that this 4* hotel didn't live up to its reviews. I've been in the hotel and tourism industry for over 25 years, and have seen wonderful 4* hotels.Note: If you have the desire for other than Chinese food, there is a great French Bistro (Des Lys) with a Table d'Hôte menu for 48RMB just behind the hotel. Feb 21 2007	Would Definitely stay at the Donghu again!	We stayed two nights at the Donghu in Shanghai after staying at another four-star hotel in nearby Suzhou for a week. We knew the hotel in Suzhou (Bamboo Grove) was well-rated by Chinese standards so after such a pleasant stay we were bracing ourselves for a come-down at the Donghu Hotel; but we were very pleasantly surprised.We called ahead to ask for a room in the old part of the hotel (as opposed to the new block across the road, seemingly more anonymous) and were indeed given an enormous, clean and nicely-furnished room in the traditional style part of the hotel. The bathroom was large and fully-functioning, the bed huge and comfortable, and whilst the room was only on the second floor and overlooking the street, we were not disturbed by noise: as other reviewers for this hotel have noted, it is in a quiet position in a leafy, pleasant area of the city so traffic blare was not a problem.We did not eat breakfast in the hotel so I cannot comment on it, but the hotel has a half dozen restaurants and bars (including a Japanese restaurant). The location was superb for walking out into the heart of Shanghai. There were plenty of eating places to choose from in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, and a pub and some smart restaurants next door to the hotel. A 10 minute taxi drive got us to the old part of Shanghai for a great day's shopping and sightseeing.Turn left out of the hotel then left again; there is a Metro stop just five minutes' walk away. This is the same line that will get you to Renmin Square, amongst other places (Line 1).For a spot of shopping right around the corner from the hotel, turn right then wander around the streets behind the hotel; there is an incredible array of small boutiques and some trendy bars if you're after a coffee.All round this is a great hotel in an unbeatable location, particularly if your time in Shanghai is at a premium and you don't want to waste a lot of time getting around town. The staff were friendly and spoke reasonable English. The room was spotless. The bed was comfortable. No noise disturbance. We could not have asked for more (especially at the price!) Aug 24 2006 	A great hotel in a great neighborhood!	I stayed at the Donghu Hotel in July of this year, and it was a fantastic choice for a Shanghai hotel. The hotel itself is spread out over several buildings on either sides of a street. Be sure to ask for a room in the Garden Building, as the building has loads of character and the rooms are very quiet. I booked the smallest room possible, and it was more than adequate for one person. The rooms are immaculate, modern, and well decorated. I was in a room at the end of a hallway, and my bathroom was huge! Nearly as big as my Tokyo apartment. Lots of free water every day, coffee machine in the room, and loads of fresh towels. My two friends booked a room with two king sized beds, and their room was massive. Two large beds, plus a huge 'porch' with windows looking over the garden and big comfy chairs for lounging.The staff spoke English fairly well - we didn't have any problems and we certainly don't speak any Chinese! The hotel is located in the French Concession, a lovely leafy neighborhood that is great to return to after a day of strolling about the city. We did not eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel so cannot vouch for them. Be sure to pay a visit to the Dragonfly Spa, just across the street from the hotel - it's a Western-style, modern spa - cheap and pure bliss! Jun 27 2006	Great hotel in even better location	The Donghu Hotel is a lovely historic cluster of buildings located in the French Concession area of Shanghai, China. The lowest price room was too smalll, so when we got there we asked for one upgrade. The next level was fine, though a little small. Our room was nicely appointed and bottles of water were supplied daily free of charge. The beds are hard, as are all the beds we slept on in China, with the exception of the Shangri-La in Hangzhou. Every direction we walked from the Donghu was interesting. Less than a block away was an &quot;old ways&quot; market street with tiny stores open to the street selling all manner of food and goods. One had very good steamed buns, fresh every day and cost pennies. The staff at the Donghu was helpful, though their English was a little rough at times. Jun 16 2006 	peaceful oasis	In the hustle and bustle of Shanghai with motorbikes on the sidewalks and cars driving through every red light - the Donghu hotel offers a peaceful oasis.Great location in the French Concession, although the Fake market at the end of the road closes down at the end of this month and relocates (still not known to where).We stayed in the garden style hotel, which is slightly more expensive but much nicer than the modern apartment block across the road which lacks personality and style.Breakfast in the hotel looked a little dodgy, but just up the road is Elements Fresh - an excellent breakfast place on the 4th floor, (outdoor roof terrace on 5th floor).The hotel staff were very courteous and friendly. The room service food was cheap and excellent. The TV had HBO channel for nonstop films (for when exploring Shanghai became too much), rooms were large and clean and the beds were comfy.I also stayed at the 5* JW Marriott the week before and although not comparable, the Donghu does offer a pleasant taste of Shanghai if you are watching your budget. May 27 2006	Great Experience	I sayed five nights here in May 2006 and had a great experience. I got one of the lower end rooms (about $65 per night), but rooms are mostly high end. It has a great location in Luwan/French Concession and is near the knock off market (soon to be closed), shops and restraunts, and a nice park where I often got up early to watch the older folks do their morning excersises. It is also near the subway system, so getting around is very easy by underground or by taxi. The thing I appreciated most is that after a busy day it was QUIET at night; the beds were also comfortable, a big plus in China. The staff spoke good English and were always pleasant and helpful. Did not try the food establishments; there is a gym which is mediocre, though there is an indoor pool which seemed quite nice. My room was on the small side, but compares well with the size of what you would get in say, Hong Kong. I would stay here again without hesitation. Nov 10 2021 	100????????????????

"Cold and arrogant staff in a great city.	The hotel is nice, not as nice as it's sister property (Sheraton) just behind, but the staff at the Four Points can be summed up as being COLD! I am not sure if it was due to the weather, me being a foreigner or just them having a bad day. They lacked smiles, they never really greeted you upon check in. More like a factory producing widgets, in this case, giving rooms to the people that walk in with or without reservations.Don't get me wrong, after you check in it goes up hill, entering the corner room with a view of both PuDong and the Bund, unfortunately the SMOG (no fault of the hotel this time) did not do justice to the view that could be had! The location is about a 20 min taxi ride out of PuDong, and the subway system is a 5 min walk from the back door (facing the Sheraton) - for the mobility challenged, be warned, there are no escalators or elevators on the hotel side, I only saw an entrance on the other side of the road.The rooms are well furnished, I had a deluxe suite with 1.5 washrooms (and no goldfish bowl shower/ bath tub setup). There is an in room safe which I suggest everyone to use while traveling anywhere that offers one, not just here.As for the hotel, there is no exec lounge, so for those looking for lounge access, not available, the gym is a basic setup (no pool), and free Wifi in the lobby. I suggest anyone looking to use to sit near the back door as there are tables setup and 1 workstation available for those that did not bring their own PC.Now the food... the cafe on 2. I hit this place for the breakfast buffet. Service... very bare bones, never asked for coffee/ tea, and when I asked for black tea, they said they did not have any and only said chinese (yellow label tea), the coffee you can skip, yes they use a fancy grind and brew per cup but the coffee sucks and only luke warm at best! The coffee in room is 100X better tasting and HOT! As for food, you can skip the hot soy milk, it was burnt both days and I did mention this to the waiters and they only said it is like that... BURNT soy milk? maybe it is an acquired taste to the local shanghainese, not to us foreigners. the omlette station only makes one type of omlette and one type of egg preparations so save your breath with saying vegi/ egg white omlette, you will get a fully loaded omlette, and for the sunnyside lovers, it will always be over easy, no matter how many times you tell them, DO NOT FLIP THE EGG! Maybe it is my accent they do not understand. They are very slow to replenish the food stations. The second say, I did give up and just left to get a big breakfast from McDonald's as the coffee there was hot and the food was the same quality (not good but will do the job in a pinch) I would expect all over the world and not from an international hotel's restaurant. Maybe I am just picky or I woke up on the wrong side of the bed but I find there is a lot of room to improve or maybe this was a Corporate request to drop down their service level as they would be directly competing with their 5 star sister property behind them???I will book the Sheraton next time as the price was only 10% more but the facilities when I toured justified the difference. Nov 22 2021 	Beautiful hotel 29 floors with panoramic restaurant at the last one	central position, close to metro, 10 minute walk from Financial Centre.free internet in the lobby, big room, king size double bed! Nov 13 2021 	Reasonably good hotel	I have stayed in this hotel half a dozen times during the past 2 - 3 years. I was surprised reading the kind of negative reviews prior to my latest stay and I was a bit worried when arriving.Fortunately I had a very pleasant stay, perhaps better than any of my previous stays. Also this time, my room was very nice and clean. Some staff was like in any other Chinese hotel and the most of them were very nice and polite.I would like to recommend the restaurant at the top floor. Usually I do not eat at the hotel restaurants, but this time and during my previous stay I had to do so due to my schedules. The noodle lunch is of excellent value and the great view is a bonus. The evening &quot;buffet&quot; is worth every RMB. It has nothing to do with the European &quot;buffet&quot; with tired food. For a fixed price you can eat as much as you want many types of Asian food: sushi, teppanyaki, noodles, ..... Everything is prepared on order and served to your table.The location is not perfect for a tourist, but the transportation in Shangai is very inexpensive. For airport transfer I would recommend taking the maglev-train. It takes about 10 minutes from the train station to the hotel. Based on experience, the train + taxi is faster than taxi from the airport. Sep 27 2021 	stay away you can do much better at other hotels in Shanghai	I come to Shanghai on business often and have stayed at other starwood brand hotels. This time my spouse was joining me for a mini long weekend in Shanghai. This is the first time for me to stay at Four Point Sheraton Pudong. I Very disappointed by how poorly trained the front desk staffs of this hotel is trained and how poorly they treat their guest. I'm a gold member of Starwood program and have stayed at many of its hotels in US and China. The person who checked me in argued with me about my reservation and acted like he was doing me a favor for upgrading me to a room class that I booked online. The room was small even though it was the deluxe size, hate to see what the regular size room look like. The only starwood hotel that I'm being charged for using the sauna. The gym is small and poorly equipped. Though there were many choices for breakfast, food quality is way below standard and some just plain bad even for chinese hotel food. I travel extensively for business and this is by far the most disappointing experience I have for being a part of the sheraton brand. Stay at the Four Point Sheraton Daning, you will get much better quality of service and comfort all around at a better price. Jul 4 2021 	4 points upon 10	Having had great experiences with other Starwood hotels, we wanted to choose a Starwood hotel for our first trip to Shanghai to ensure a great trip. We decided to try out Four Points by Sheraton as it was new to us. The experience turned out immensely disappointing.Service:Service fell sharply of the upscale image the chain would like to project.No doorman or porter greeted us when we first entered the hotel. It felt like the hotel had recently underwent a retrenchment exercise; besides the three counter staff, there was no one else to be seen. At the SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) counter we were served by a moody-faced girl who looked absolutely unhappy to be at work. She was not very competent in English so we switched to speaking Mandarin to hurry along the process. She was not only unappreciative, her attitude got worse.We were surprised by the large sum of deposit we had to give (CNY1500; we were only in Shanghai for 3 days and thus did not bring along a lot of cash), and after we had given the deposit we contemplated using a credit card instead. The girl made a big show of tearing up the receipt she had issued for the cash and had a look of extreme annoyance. We quickly realised we had forgotten our credit cards, and at this point she had forgotten all manners and threw the new receipt she had written without even looking at us. Seeing there was no manager around and also that we were on a tight schedule we did not pursue this appalling incident, but it had left us with a dismal first impression of Four Points Pudong.Throughout our stay, most of the staff we encountered appeared to be in a hurry and behaved as if we were in their way. They do not seem to realise that hotel guests are the very reason for them having their jobs. Out of the 15 or so staff we encountered during our stay, only the 2 concierges, the chambermaid and our checkout staff were pleasant. Rooms:The room was relatively modern and clean, possessing all the fittings expected of a Starwood hotel. The neutral theme was aesthetically pleasing. One nice touch in particular was the french press. The King standard room we received differed from the one shown on the website. Instead of the modern bathroom with a window to the room, we had a normal separate bathroom (with tub). Also, there was only a small armchair instead of a sofa (I supposed one person was expected to enjoy their coffee on the bed). The window was tiny, no bigger than two pieces of A4 paper, which rendered being on a higher level (16th) pointless. Overall, while not greatly detrimental, it was slightly disappointing as I had preferred the look of the room presented on the website. Pluses were the comfortable bed, 2 of 2 types of pillows, large tv (with foreign channels such as TV5 Monde &amp; BBC), and the lovely plaid carpet. One additional point to note is that the water temperature in the bathroom takes 5mins to adjust, so be careful with setting it too hot.Location:I can't imagine this place being a good location for anyone. While there was a metro stop (Tangqiao, line 4) right outside the Sheraton next door, it will take a minimum of half an hour to get anywhere one would possibly like to visit in Shanghai -- considering that the metro for this line generally took 10mins to arrive. Additionally, service on this particular line (and other newer lines) ended pretty early, around 10pm. Cab rides were faster but as you might know, cabs can be scarce when you need them the most and traffic can be horrendous in Shanghai. Cab fare from the Bund to hotel was about CNY25; CNY14 from Times square.The hotel area was quite gray and honestly not an area I would want to venture about alone. There was a 24h McDonald's right opposite the hotel, a beef noodles place and a convenience store, but that was about it. The entrance of McDonald's was crowded with pedicabs and their drivers -- who tried to cajole anyone within earshot into taking their pedicabs.We had flown in from Guangzhou so we arrived at Hongqiao Airport. While there was no fancy Maglev, we were able to take a public bus (938, alight at stop #15 Ningyang Road) which costed merely CNY6 per person and was a nice way for a first look at Shanghai. The ride took about an hour in good traffic. While the bus was not very clean (I feel confident in saying the curtains have not been washed in at least 5 years), it was still decent and the lady bus conductor was warm and helpful -- informing us personally of our stop and pointing the way to our hotel. Walking distance from stop to hotel was less than 5mins even with luggage. We also tried out taking the metro (alighting at Beixinjing and then taking a short, CNY21 cab ride) to Hongqiao Airport -- it was very inconvenient with the interchanges when you have luggage (at 1 of the interchanges we had to walk about 5mins to get to the relevant line).Cleanliness:Hotel and room were both very clean. No faults here. We had left our pajamas on the chair, and upon our return found them neatly folded by the chambermaid. Sadly this was the only hint of Sheraton hospitality throughout our 3-day stay.Value:If one were able to get an excellent deal during off-peak season and were solely interested in having a room to stay in, this hotel would perhaps be considered to be of good value. Taking into consideration the poor service and location, personally we felt this hotel to be of poor value -- especially for a Sheraton. Overall the experience feels 4 points all right -- upon 10. Definitely would not consider staying here again. Jun 12 2021 	Very comfortable rooms	One cannot fault the rooms of this hotel. They are very modern and everything you'd expect of a Sheraton. The views are fantastic, too. Breakfast is a reasonably good mix of Asian and Western choices.The location is not ideal if you need to be downtown as the traffic is horrendous. However, there is a very good metro next to the hotel which is extremely easy to use, clean, safe and reliable. Jun 3 2021 	Good hotel but inconvinient Location	This is a very good and new hotel with very good nice rooms and amenities. The hotel staff was nice but the location is not good but anyway nice to stay if you are on business trip. Nov 2 2008	Four Points Shanghei	We stayed here 10/29/08 for 2 nights. The hotel is in the new section of Shanghai, the Pudong area, east of the Bund. Traffic in Shanghai is horrible and so travel times anywhere is long. The room was spacious and very clean. We had a King on the 6th floor. The Breakfast buffet was very disappointing considering this is a Sheraton property. The Holiday Inns we stayed in previously were much better. For a vegetarian there were only bread and pastries to be found. There was some fruit, and hot meat dishes. Breakfast is on the 29th floor, so there is a view, although very hazy due to the smog. The rooms have French press coffee in them which was very good compared to the hotel coffee at breakfast. Actually the room coffee was very good coffee in general. Feb 3 2008 	Good Hotel with ample amendities nearby	Our company sent us there for our annual sales conference and i have to say that this is one of the better hotel that we have stayed in.It's clean, the front desk and service staff are friendly. The ballroom that we had our meetings in are well layout and comfortable.The only dislike i have of Four Point was it's location, it did'nt helped that it was snowing heavily when we were there and trying to get a cab to go downtown can be quite a hassle. Other than that, this is one hotel that i would recommend for travellers looking for a hotel in the suburb area. Jun 2 2007 	Nice hotel Poor location Unfriendly attitudes	We came to this hotel on May 29,2007 at around 1 pm. At that time, no one in the lobby helping us for the luggage. When my wife check in for room, she ask if she as SPG member could have a better room, but the lady (NOT the trainee) told her that she need to stay in the hotel 25 times in order to have a better room and then gave her the key card of Room 702. We check in the room and I saw that there are many hairs on the floor, therefore I went down to the front desk to complain at once. Then they put us to another room, No.1616. It is same kind of room as 702 (comfort twin), but different floor and no hairs on the floor. During these couple days, I noticed that most of the staff in this hotel don’t have a smiley face and don’t understand English very well. To be honest, this is the first time we choose Four Points, but I don’t think we will come back again to a hotel without a warm feeling. By the way, I would like to say thanks to Tony, Guest Service Manager. He is the one who can communicate with English. Talking about location, the nearest metro is 25 minutes walk, but they are building one underground. May 28 2007	Very Pleasant Experience - Compared to the other 4 Points Property	Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over 2 different stays in May.Public Areas: Stylish/Clean. No pool.Location: Poor but 10 mins taxi ride to almost anywhere.Room: Nice and Clean. Free internet access. No tub but not sure its necessaryService: Prompt but the service industry in China just isnt as attentive and sincere as other leading Asian cities. When I asked for a complimentary shoe shine, the service was offered but the staff who came for my shoes gave me a mean look.I would stay here again, despite its location. My experience at the 4 points in Daning was simply too terrible. Feb 22 2007 	Very nice hotel but location is not central	This was a very new, modern hotel with very nice rooms and amenities. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby and common areas aesthetically pleasing. The only negative is that the location is not very central. It is in a &quot;suburb&quot; of Shanghai. There is a busy shopping district that is less than a 10 minute cab ride away. Downtown Shanghai is a good 20-25 minute cab ride away. Jan 8 2007	Nice service inconvenient location	Although the services are basic and not very geared to the foreign tourist, the quality of service here couldn't have been nicer. All the staff were exceptionally pleasant (not true in all hotels in China), and also exceptionally responsive to requests. Nearly every request we had was acted on within 5 minutes.The downside of the hotel is its location. The hotel advertises itself as being next to a subway station, but in reality this subway station hasn't opened yet, and won't open until the end of 2007. The closest open subway station is a 20 minute difficult walk through a heavily trafficked sidwalks. The hotel is also in a commercially isolated area -- there are no restaurants or stores in walking distance of the hotel, making one feel stuck. The hotel is a good 20 minutes cab ride from the Bund. While travel by cab is not expensive, it can be very difficult to find an empty cab in the evening to get back to the hotel.While the decor of the hotel is pleasant, I sense there were some recurring issues with the hotel's physical plant. We had several problems with pumbling (clogged pipes, rattling pipes) occuring in two different rooms. Aug 23 2006	Extremely clean stylish facilities	I would not hestitate to stay in this hotel over and over again if it were not for the terrible sheets/bedding. They were as hard as sandpaper and seemed like they had never been washed when they came from the factory. Jun 27 2006 	Brand new discovery	The Hotel opened doors on May 23, 2006, so everything is brand spanking new, so new it even smelled new. The building used to be the Grand You You Hotel but has been transformed entirely. There will be a Sheraton in the vicinity soon.Welcoming and elegant Lobby, friendly greetings - check-in staff was very helpful and changed my room when I asked for one with a bath-tub.The rooms are well-sized and clean - both in design and as such. Plenty of lights, with an impressive 32&quot; LCD TV, a friendly little sitting area, enough smartly placed mirrors, a truly comfortable bed. The bathroom has a window to the room - which is great since it lets in some natural light. And there is a privacy screen that descends on the push of a button when needed. Another nifty feature of the bathroom: an ambient light that is just perfect at night - enough to see everything but no blinding pain when you switch it on.There are other 'little things' that make the stay enjoyable: two free bottles of drinking water are sitting in the bathroom, and a fresh orchid was placed there as well to bring some colour to the plate, you also have the much appreciated coffee and tea to make yourself. There is an evening turn-down service, the in-room air-conditioning works great, but the floors were at times rather hot during this time of the year..The breakfast buffet is VERY complete and offers everything you can look for in a Western Breakfast with plenty of Asian options as well, there even is a chef preparing your eggs to order.The fitness facilities had a temporary home on the 28 floors (which still needs to be renovated) - but provided enough for a basic workout.So - this is an efficient and agreeable hotel, which was located just right for reaching the New International Expo Center as well as taking a quick trip to town, or the sights in Pudong. All in all, perfect for a budget conscious business traveller who stills wants style and convenience.Only one thing: I was repeatedly charged for items from the minibar which I hadn't touched during my stay. But I was able to sort things out quickly with the helpful staff.With everything being so new, staff sometimes seemed a bit overwhelmed - but once these last growing pains are sorted out, the hotel is definitely worth staying there. The Four Points was a safe, clean and truly comfortable place to stay. Mar 23 2005	You You So So	This modern four-star &quot;business&quot; hotel in Pudong is not too close to anything. However, taxis are both cheap and exciting so that wasn't a major factor for us.The rooms are fairly large and well maintained. The mattresses are too firm for our tastes, but similar to those experienced in two other four-star hotels on the same trip.The breakfast buffet was plentiful in one sense, but repetitive and without too much for the non-Asian guest. The coffee, however, was excellent!The restaurant on the top floor had a great view, although the room itself was too bright, and we dined well for less than $20 for the two of us. The English translation allowed us to pass on such delicacies as Frog Soup in Green Colour and Stewed Pig's Rectum.The bar was a noisy and cramped space that we bypassed. The main-floor restaurant (where breakfast is served) doesn't have much in the way of ambience either. We did not visit the hotel's other two restaurants, beauty salon, or bowling alley. The outdoor pool was not yet open for the season.Lack of employee fluency in English was a surprise to us with so many tourists present, but possibly due to its niche as a &quot;business&quot; hotel. This led to a mildly annoying incident just before we left. A sign in the lobby advertises an airport shuttle about four times daily. Employees told us twice that we did not require a reservation. We still asked the day before departing, and were first told at the desk that there was NO shuttle. The concierge/bellhop desk then left us standing for upwards of 15 minutes before returning with a translation that the 8:00 a.m. shuttle was &quot;booked up. Sorry, have a nice day.&quot; Still, the shuttle is currently 40 Yuan each (about US $5), and the taxi ride to Pudong Airport (PVG) is about $120 Yuan, so the experience was at least as amusing as it was annoying.We stayed at the You You for a total of six nights in two stays as part of a tour package, and by definition it was excellent value. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it again, but it met our needs. Dec 19 2008 	Ottimo se partecipi a una Fiera a Pudong"
"Great location and helpful staff	We had one night at the New Harbour Hotel and the next day switched here. Fraser was perfect for us. The rooms were a bit small, but new and clean. We had a 2 bedroom with washer/dryer and full kitchen. Only negative was one bath for a family of 5, but we managed. They could do a bit better with the daily housekeeping (the trash cans are small and they did not empty them), but otherwise great place. The staff was so helpful and very patient with my 3 young boys. Breakfast for 2 was included at Element Fresh and we just bought extra. The location was great-we could walk everywhere! I highly recommend this place. Good business center and small gym, but had treadmills, weights, etc. Pool was a short walk located at the spa across the yard. Nice pool, but not great for kids since it was in the spa; will say the spa staff was patient with us. Aug 31 2021 	Good Choice for Serviced Apartment near XinTianDi	I stayed here for a month during the summer, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable service apartment near the XinTianDi area. The service apartment is well located - about a 10mins walk to XinTianDi, 2 mins to HuaiHai Road, and the Times Square shopping mall where there is a good supermarket. Fraser Residence also is home to a trendy restaurant, Fat Olive, managed by local celebrity chef David Laris, and Element Fresh, a reliable salad/ sandwich chain popular with Shanghai expats. I had some problems with housekeeping but after a few calls to the front desk, those issues were resolved. Front desk is very helpful in general. Pool is dismal. I paid about RMB 600/ night for a one-bedroom for the duration of my stay. Jun 14 2021 	Much better than the earlier reviews indicate	Despite prior Tripadvisor reviews, we stayed at the Fraser because it is close to where our daughter has a summer internship, we needed a 2BR apartment, and our travel agent negotiated a very good rate for an 11-day stay. We were wonderfully surprised at the quality of the room and the services of the staff. There are two excellent American-style restaurants on the sixth floor that are very popular with the local expat community (The Fat Olive and Fresh Essential). The food was good and reasonably priced, and friendly waitresses taught us some Mandarin.The location is within walking distance of Huai Hai Lu shopping area (2 blocks north), a grocery and ATM machines in the basement level of Times Square shopping mall, People's Square, Xintiandi, and Old Town. Taxis are so cheap that you probably won't walk, though, except for the exercise. The staff was helpful in writing our destinations in Chinese characters for the cab drivers. Ask the hotel to get its driver to pick you up from Pudong Airport rather than rattle around in a cramped cab. Be sure to carry the hotel's cab card to get back to the htoel because many of the cabbies found it tough to find the place.We like the Fraser so much that we negotiated a monthly rate for our daughter, who is staying for another 10 weeks in a 1BR apartment at the Frayser during her summer job.There will be construction throughout Shanghai until Expo 2020, including putting a subway under Xi Zhang South Road next to the Frayser. The noise was not too bad, though, on the 17th floor. Apr 15 2021 	great location to experience local living	Booked a 2 bedroom penthouse. Living room is newly renovated &amp; very nice. But bedrooms are very small. with a baby cot, there's hardly space to walk. Toilets looked barely renovated, as the style &amp; design are very different from the living rooms. Washing machine was not working well - dryer timer was spoilt &amp; 6 hours later, my clothes were still drying! Luckily they fixed the problem after I notified them. Broadband internet also took some time to fix before I could use them. Kitchen utensils are quite complete. With young kids I usually buy food back &amp; dine in, so the bowls &amp; plates come in handy.Food - not impressed with Element Fresh. Bought my breakfast at the streets nearby. Freshly baked cakes going at 8 rmb for 10. Deep fried dough (you tiao) at 1 rmb each. Yummy. For dinner, the restaurants in the streets nearby sell fried rice at 5 rmb a plate, duck noodle soup at 8 rmb, fresh big oysters at 1 rmb per piece, prawns, crabs etc etc....Initially I thought the location was a little far - took me a good 10 min to walk to Huangpi nan rd. But soon I found a gem. The next section of Shou Ning Rd comes alive after 9pm. Road stalls lined the road, selling clothes, DVDs, &amp; food (fried noodles). Really got a feel of how the locals live. Apr 5 2021 	Good choice	Nice, clean apartment style facility.Free internet. Courteous staff all around. Element Fresh Restaurant provided decent breakfast; great juice bar.Location also good for walking, subway.Would recommend. Oct 11 2018 	Very LOUD! - under construction	ok, well here are some things that every person needs to know. I have stayed in this hotel off and on since March 2018. The Hotel is undergoing a phased renovation. As a result, there is constrant noise ocurring very early in the morning. They tell you that the construction only starts at 9:00PM, but in fact the banging has started at 7:00AM. It is now Sunday morning that I am writing this review, and I can assure you that there is allot of noise going on right now which woke me up at 7:00AM. I've complained for months, but the truth is, construction workers are very hard to control here in China. I highly recommend staying awya from this hotel for at least 6 months while they finish their work. Feb 12 2021	???????????"
"Nov 20 2021	Nice Hotel; Very Modern	We spent a night at this hotel during our China tour. I didn't notice the dirty carpets that others have complained about in their reviews. The breakfast was excellent and is served in the atrium that offers a gorgeous view straight up the inside of the towering building, with giant scrolls running down the walls. Our room (not sure if it was a standard or not, since our tour group booked it for us) was very nice and came with some additional features like a washer/dryer, which is handy if you've been traveling around and have accumulated a pile of dirty clothes (and laundry service is EXPENSIVE). The inside of the hotel was very beautiful and modern. Nov 16 2021 	keep your slippers handy	just returned from the galaxy hotel...Checked in all looked fine. Got up to the room and all I can say is DIRTY. Carpets looked like a construction worker had tried to ground mud into the carpet. afraid to take off our shoes...found the slippers and put them on as a barrier to the carpet. Not sure all the towels had been replaced...so climate change be darned we put every single towel in the tub to be changed. not that close to the subway....but a 10 minute walk got you to a line that let you transfer to line 2 and all of the sights of shanghai. loved the city but not the hotel..... Sep 1 2021 	Mutton dressed as lamb	I stayed at this hotel to attend an exhibition at the Exposition. Its certainly not as local is made out on the information I got, and its a good 20 minute walk (and you have to cross some major 10 lane roads) to get there! This hotel is ok - the second room I got was ok, having rejected the first on the basis that it was dirty (there were stains all over the bed covers...) Although my room had been prepaid (and guaranteed) by one of the worlds largest business travel agents, I still had to pay DOUBLE the room rate per night up front on either a credit card (not as a pre-authorisation, as an actual transation) or in cash. None of the staff speak more than a few words of English either - making it rather difficult.The major problem of this hotel is the dining - breakfast is expensive by western rates (15 Euros) for quite a limited buffet - and other meals are far more. I never had more than basic meals in the other restaurants as the quality was horrific, and the cost was very high... Beer at the bar/restaurant is horrifically expensive, at 4.50 Euro per bottle of cheap beer. There were a lot of things that really bugged me during this stay - like the chinese waitress who began to lay the table for the next customer literally seconds after I had finished my meal and was still drinking (!), to the terrible layout of reception and the other parts of the hotel and having to pay for everything upfront, twice over. (internet, mini-bar). Also, if you want to sit in the bar at night (which is terrible and 8 dollars a beer) you'll need to be able to tolerate the horrific chinese renditions of western love songs, sung daily by a cheap, tired group from 7-11pm. I ended up drinking beer with my iPod on just to drown it out.I got room service on one night, and after eating something and thinking &quot;this is a bit cold&quot; I got violent food poisoning for the next 12 hours. This hotel is not near the center of anything - its a 30 RMB taxi to downtown, and more to other tourist spots. The hotel appeared nice when I first arrived, but during my 5 night stay I learned to really despise it. This was made even worse when I when for dinner at the Rennaisance just 400 yards away (which was 30% more for a room) and it was in a different league. It was like taking a cheap, tacky Chinese hotel (which the galaxy is) where hookers hang out every night, and comparing it to a beautiful western hotel with chinese influence and amazing bars and evening entertainment. I was gutted. this was a really bad choice for me - next time its anything but the Galaxy. Jun 14 2021 	With Good view of Shanghai	Nice Hotel with good amenities and ample room space. Covers good view of Shanghai from hotel room and lobby.Thanks to the room and interior heating system which makes us to forget that we are in a city where outside temperature is sub zero. Located in the heart of city and having good connectivity with main attractions of city. Nice Cuisine with Shanghai's Famous Crab Jun 11 2021 	Good Hotel if English is not needed	Stayed here for one night as we could not get accommodation in Renaissance for our full stay in Shanghai.It is located in the same business district as Renaissance and costs something like 70% of what Renaissance charges.A good value for money at the price you pay with all standard business facilities as well as a pool and gym.The downside is the fact that not many of the staff members speak English or can help you if you ask a question in English.As it was my first trip to Shanghai, it was difficult to make them understand what I want (unlike the Renaissance where you are at home).The rooms were good as was the bathroom and the linen. May 14 2021 	Cheaper than a Five Star	I moved here from my return from Jinan as this Hotel was cheaper than the Renaissance Yangtze...and I wish I hadn't. This Hotel is huge! No personal touch at all and full of loads of tourists and tour Operations. The Housekeeping staff went to the extent of trying to charge me for water and sanitary napkins without a bill. There was no breakfast place and the measly sandwich I could pick up in the Lobby was overpriced. Definitely not my kind of place, but OK just to spend a night or so. Jan 20 2021 	Highs and Lows	Its really quite hard where to start describing the Galaxy as it tries to be all things to all people. Its well located in Shanghai for most business areas and perhaps has a better western food selection than most other hotels I've stayed in in Shanghai. (The breakfast is great..) Also the view from the top floor (32nd floor) bar, on the odd clear night that you get is just fantastic, (well worth the extra you pay for the drinks..). The ammenities are great, shops, barbers, selection of restaurants, bar, even a Karaoke style and full nightclub are here, as well as the usual sports and gym activites. (so you will never be bored in the evenings..)I imagine when the hotel opened it was very grand, however it now looks very tired and in need of a good clean, also you are likely (western business men espicially), to get followed in by girls, off the street, and bothered by other locals, even as far as the girls will try and get in your room. The hotel staff seem to turn a blind eye to this, as do the local police.At night unless you are brave enough to try and take a taxi somewhere, there is very little to do or see around the hotel area, and again if you do venture out you will soon be approached by girls.Not a bad hotel for a short business stay, but not one for the family or longer vacation and please Galaxy.. Get the cleaners in.. Sep 20 2018 	Old and dirty Hotel do not book this hotel!	The hotel was not remodeled for the last years, therefore you will find dirty carpets and bathrooms and beds. When you arrive at night a lot of chinese girls wait for you to come to your room...The breakfast was o.k. but very expensive (about 20 USD) Never again! Jun 5 2018	Very Nice but out of the way	We just returned to Canada from staying at the Galaxy in Shanghai on our tour. The hotel lobby on the 1st and 2nd floors are very elegant. The hotel room was nice but nothing exceptional. The carpets were dirty as were the other two hotels we stayed. The breakfast was better than average and the service was great. The reception staff were not very interested or helpful when we asked about getting one bed instead of two.We went for a walk around the area and found it was not in the best location. However it was great for our bus tour as it was near all the tourist attractions we visited. Apr 30 2018	FILTHY CARPETS	I escorted a tour to China and our group stayed 2 nights at the Galaxy Shanghai. Although in the middle of nowhere, the first impression of this large convention hotel was excellent....beautiful huge lobby, bar with live entertainment, nice restaurants and friendly bell boys. When we got off the elevator on the 10th floor, I remarked that the rugs in the hallway definitely needed shampooing. They were filthy. At first glance the room looked ok, perhaps a bit &quot;tired&quot; for a 4 star hotel and in need of re-decorating...but then I noticed the carpet...every square inch of the carpet was filthy, filthy, filthy! I mean ground in &quot;mud&quot; ! I have been a travel agent for 30 years and have never seen anything like it. Our group had 7 rooms booked on the 10th &amp; 14th floors, and every room was the same. One room also had cups filled with tea from the previous guests still sitting on the dresser. Everyone in my group commented this hotel was absolutely disgusting and in a bad location. Better to stay in the area of Nanjing Road. Mar 18 2018	Good location for the price	This hotel was well located (if it's possible to be so in Shanghai) Best shopping was at the Pearl International Market which was a $2 cab ride away...slightly further, the &quot;Bazaar&quot; had all the 'local' goods and the sellers were wiling to bargain. I dont' recommend the hotel restaurant (except for the hot dogs which were awesome!) as they put whipping cream on the baked potato! Great for a laugh but not real tasty. The rooms were spacious and well appointed....and quiet. The staff was very helpful with everything including taxi drivers. I would definately recommend this hotel. Nov 17 2007	Well run hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel in September 2007 for 4 nights as part of a group tour.We found the hotel to be more professional than the other hotels on our tour. The staff were friendly and helpful.Our room was decent and clean without being anything spectacular. The beds were hard as per everywhere else in China. Galaxy has a smallish gym with good equipment, but no pool. This hotel had the best buffet breakfast of our tour hotels - good quality and a wide variety of food. For snacks and groceries, we walked to the Parkson Grand, which has a supermarket downstairs. The Friendship store is closer but more expensive. We had an excellent foot massage just down the road from Parkson (there are big &quot;massage&quot; signs pointing down the street). There is probably not much in the way of tourist attractions near the hotel. It is about a 20 minute taxi-ride to the city. The park nearby was vibrant at night, with locals dancing and singing. Overall this is a nice hotel that offers good value and professional service. Oct 18 2007	Great Place The Galaxy	We were with a tour group and enjoyed our 4 night stay at this hotel. The atmosphere was good and the breakfast which was included had an excellent selection. We did have room service on one night when we arrived at the hotel late and it was rather slow coming but an enjoyable pasta meal all the same. One thing we found really strange that we were asked to pay cash when we were guests of the hotel. This was the 1st time that this had ever happened to us. We also had this same problem with our laundry so my husband went down stairs and paid directly at reception. We did find that some of the staff had very poor English.We had supper one night in a very nice bar area, the service was excellent and nothing was too much bother. There was nice piano music which created a nice ambience.Our room was large with two double size beds and nice clean bed linen with a good size bathroom. It was not a luxury type room but definitely adequate There were tea making facilites replenished each day and bottled drinking water supplied.One thing should be mentioned is the fact that this hotel may appear to be close to the airport but in fact it is at least an hour or more away &amp; longer in peak traffic from the Pudong International Airport. Many people have made this mistake and ended up at the other airport which is used more for Domestic flights . The very fast train is a good option to get to Pudong but the time table currently only starts just after 7.00am and if you have an early flight is perhaps not possible. Certainly something to be considered when booking flights. Sep 7 2007 	Good hotel not a great area for exploring	While the convenience to Hongqiao airport (the domestic airport for China) is quite ideal, the ease of access via metro into Shanghai city proper isn't the best. You pretty much need to take a cab to the nearest metro stop. Cabs are very cheap so you might be better off just taking a taxi for your entire journey. Nothing is in walking distance and it is surrounded by other business type hotels. Lots of tour groups stay here which fills the property up. Clean, pleasant and decent breakfast buffet. Aug 26 2007 	Enjoyed the Galaxy!	I stayed at this hotel for business meetings in Shanghai. The hotel is lovely, with a great breakfast buffet in the morning - western style food as well as local food. There are two restaurants in the hotel, one is local food -- very good selections and good service -- and a Korean BBQ -- also very good food and good service. I stayed in the business suites for my stay and found the accommodations very tasteful and elegant. It had a spa-like feel to the room, towels, etc.As for the location, yes it is a bit west of downtown Shanghai proper. However, I did go out walking several days to antique shops, memorial gardens, etc. I took a cab to other places I wanted to see (Yu Garden, Bund, temples, etc) and found the cab fare to be very reasonable -- only about 3-5 dollars per ride. The traffic is a bit cumbersome, so the cab rides sometimes were a bit lengthy.All in all, I found the stay at this hotel to be very nice. It served the business needs quite well. If I were in Shanghai only for vacation, it might be nice to be closer to downtown, but as I said, cab fare is reasonable and finding a cab is quite easy. Aug 6 2007	Good clean accommodations	Stayed at this hotel at the beginning of a 14-day tour of China; we spent three nights here. Location is not desirable as it is not central to all the attractions. But since we were in a group tour, we drove to all the sights and attractions from early morning to evening with no time to spare. Hotel is rated as a four-diamond by Chinese standards, but by American standards, I would only rate this as three-diamond. Saw lots of Americans/Europeans, but most of the staff spoke very little English. Breakfast was extremely good with Chinese and Western dishes. They even have a Korean and Japanese corner with sushi and miso soup. Quality of food is above average. Service is a little more to be desired. You have to wait for your coffee cup to be refilled. Rooms are extremely clean and well appointed. We had a in-room safe along with refrigerator in our room. The only thing that it lacked was an iron &amp; board which you have to call to bring up to your room.This is an excellent hotel for tour groups. For individual leisure travelers, the location is undesirable and you will have to find transportation to get everywhere. Jun 21 2007 	Nice Hotel	Arrived for three days and two night. Great hotel, but it is not located near the main attractions. The hotel staff was wonderful and the breakfasts were great. The rooms were very large and clean. The hotel has a two stry lobby that was very interesting. The elevators were very fast and the staff met all of my needs. If you are going to Shanghai for business and do not need to see any of the sights, this is a wonderful place to do business. Several meeting were being conducted all over the hotel. However, if you want to get out and walk the streets at nigh and be near the sights this is not the place for you. Apr 14 2007 	Chinese hospitality	Spent two nights at the Galaxy at the end of a three city trip.Glitzy high rise hotel catering to business and pleasure tourists from all over the world. Very nice room, very clean. Very close to Parkson department store and City Center Bldg (walkable). Lots of service help everywhere. Mostly very helpful but not always in the large breakfast area. Ample buffet style with lots of choices, more Western than I liked but there was something for everyone. A &quot;Korean Corner&quot;, baked beans and white sausage for the Brits, frosted flakes for the Americans. Service was lacking here, maybe because they were so busy. We were seated at the end of a table for 8 where there were 8 people. No offer to move us, they brought 2 more chairs and squeezed everyine in. Took 3 requests for a spoon before we went and found our own. Coffe was not self-erve and took a very long time to get a refill. Long wait for juice glasses and fruit bowls to be filled in at buffet. Scramble style area so lots of bumping and queueing repeatedly.Received an electic adapter less than 2 minutes after requesting.Two complimentary bottlesof drinking water each dayTakes a very long time to get hot water butwhen it comes, there is plenty and water pressure very good. Feb 14 2007	good way to end our tour	The Galaxy hotel was our last hotel on our 15 day tour. There werea lot of North Americans at this hotel. The rooms were clean and modern. The buffet breakfast was delicious and was one the highlights for us in Shanghai. This hotel was not along the Bund but we were able to take a taxi there for under $10. There was also some stores and restaurants nearby (although we didn't eat there) Nov 20 2021 	??????? Oct 29 2021 	???????????? Sep 1 2021 	?????????? Jan 25 2021 	???????????? Oct 29 2018 	?????????

"Nov 21 2021 	Disappointed cannot be called an art gallery hotel	I read about this hotel from Business Traveler Magazine and had some expectations on the decor and design of this @Gallery Suites (Art Gallery Suites Hotel). However, when I entered into a tiny lobby with only one small piece of artwork, I began to doubt. Then, when I entered into my own suite (#301), I was very surprised as it is no where like what the BT Magazine described. My room has a plain green wall with no art work, no design and such. The room size is good but it was so noisy from car horns on the street from like six in the morning till mid-night. Service is okay but this new hotel definitely does not meet my expectation and I will not stay there again. Nov 9 2021 	Art Décor Style in Shanghai	I was in Shanghai for business and stayed 6 nights at the Gallery Suites Hotel. I have heard of this hotel because it is owned by a Singapore tour company and also because the interior style of their rooms have been much talked about in the local press.Objectively speaking, the location of the hotel is rather ideal as it is located in the French Concession quarters. The surrounding environment has a somewhat European feel and there are many little eateries and restaurants nearby. The underground station is merely a few minutes’ walk away and the Huaihai Road shopping street is only 2 stations away. There is also a shopping district about 5mins’ walk, through a nice park, so you really won’t feel the distance.The hotel itself is a conservation building and has only 50+ rooms. Rooms are spacious and very well-appointed. One thing to note is that the rooms may be more suitable for couples or single travelers as the bathroom is separated from the bedroom with only a beaded curtain and nothing else (at least for the room I had). The room is equipped with LCD TV, DVD player, free internet access and iPod docking station (on request). The hotel will also provide you a mobile phone for local calls, which I think is a very useful service. Staff are generally attentive and obliging and most speak English. Breakfast, although it is included in the room rates, starts only 7.30am, so if you need to leave the hotel earlier for business or tour, you can request for them to pack some local breakfast for you.All in all, I cannot find anything negative about the hotel and would not hesitate to recommend anyone who is thinking of staying there. I would probably stay here again if I need to go to Shanghai in the future! Oct 29 2021	The only boutique hotel in Shanghai!	If you're looking for a unique experience then the gallery suites is an ideal boutique hotel option!We travelled as a group of over 20 ppl and the hotel managed to accommodate our needs sufficiently. An added bonus was the friendly staff who did their best to ensure each guest had a pleasant experience. Special thanks to Frankie , Ben, Angie and the rest of the team that assisted us.The hotel is newly opened and has a non smoking policy in place to everyone's delight. Rooms were spacious and were beautifully decorated in an art deco style of old Shanghai but with all the modern day conveniences we like. Recommend you take time to enjoy the tea room and art gallery they have!Hotel is located in the picturesque French Concession area and was also close to the main attractions of Shanghai. The only meal the hotel provides is breakfast which was simple but service was disappointing. Unfortunately there's no room service available either but given the experience with breakfast may be a good opportunity to try one of the many restaurants in the area.We all had a great experience and would recommend this hotel for both personal and small group tours. Sep 14 2021 	Very Nice Indeed	This is how impressed I am with this beautifully restored boutique hotel in Shanghai - I can't wait to get home to give them the review :) therefore I am writing it here in the room now.Location-wise it's great as it's only a very short walk to the Heng Shan Lu/Road Station (Line 1) on the Metro (subway) line, it's not right at &quot;downtown&quot; which works out perfectly for us as I get to experience more of the local flavours of Shanghai. It's in a residential area next to a little park. We got a nice room that also has a &quot;sun-room&quot; which is great to relax on the chaise lounge after an action-packed day of walking and sight-seeing (or if you are here on business).Breakfast is included though the choices may be a little limited - (yet sufficient) - for us it's a not a problem as we prefer to go for the local options of soy milk and fried dough (You Tiao in Mandarin) for breakfast anyway - being Chinese it's a treat to relive those fond child memories.Everyone here has been extremely friendly and approachable, while at the same time very efficient. We arrived after a long flight from Chicago direct, and it was a little before their scheduled check-in time of 3 pm. The room wasn't ready then (which we didn't expect it to be since it's a relatively small operation of less than 40 rooms) so we were treated with tea/coffee at the lounge. The Guest Service Manager offered to give us a tour of the building and some of the rooms (so if we are happy with any of them instead of our designated room they would be happy to switch for us). They are all beautiful rooms indeed, the interior designers did a fantastic job restoring this heritage listed art deco building.In the end though, we still prefer the room we were assigned to (for the fact that it has a little triangular &quot;sun-room&quot;) - the wait wasn't too long really.I had chosen this hotel for the fact that they advertised it as an entirely non-smoking property (which of course is very important when one has issues with allergies). I had stayed in other properties in Asia before, at times even if you requested a non-smoking room (or non-smoking floor), the room would still stink like an ash-tray regardless of the hotel class. So this really was a big selling point for people like me.At check-in, we also discovered that they would provide you with a mobile phone to use (I even got my Skype-in number diverted to it) so you are still connected even when out and about, very handy! There is no charge for in-coming calls, think about all the roaming charges you save :)YES, I would love to stay here again if we visit Shanghai in the future. Sep 5 2021 	Step back in time at this fantastic boutique hotel	Positioned near Hengshan Road station this is a great little hotel. Only 40 rooms decorated in Art Deco style, the staff couldn't have been more welcoming and friendly. I had problems with my TV which they immediately apologised for and upgraded me to a bigger Art Deco Suite.Great place to base yourself to explore the wonderful French Concession and it's a only 15 minutes on the subway to get to the Bund and Pudong.It has been recently opened and they have done a great job in keeping the character of the building. They are still waiting for the cable channels to be installed for overseas TV shows, but that's hardly a problem. There is a cafe downstairs where you can get a complimentary breakfast, but didn't see if they offered room service for meals and/or drinks.Overall, a thoroughly good, clean and spacious hotel, and if I go back to Shanghai then I will certainly stay there again. Nov 25 2021 	Excellent Oct 29 2021	?????????????"
"Apr 22 2018 	Mixed feelings	I stayed at this hotel last year in march. Actually, I was rather satisfied with my choice but there are a few issues which contribute to a lower rating. Advatages:- Beautiful rooms. In my opinion, one of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever been to. They are big, very clean, equipped with everything one could need and have a special atmoshere.- Friendly and helpful staff.- Nice common areas with Chinese influence in furniture and architecture.Disadvatages:- Location. There is nothing of interest in that area, even no posibilities to have a drink. The only way (exept taxis) to get to the Bund is taking a bus (up to half an hour!!) and it is complicated to find the bus station, especially on the way back from the Bund to the hotel.- Breakfast is tasteless and served in ugly rooms, partly without windows. - No spa area in the hotel (at least I couldn't find any)- Appearance from outside is nothing special, just a simple block which cannot be compared to the stunning hotel architecture in Shanghai (but this is a minor issue)To sum it up, I do not regret having stayed in the Golden Jade Sunshine but there are surely better choices.Shanghai as a city is well worth a visit. It does not have the same historical and cultural feeling as Beijing but is a perfect example if you want to see how a nation's national economy can prosper. Quaters like Pudong, the Bund or Nanjing street as well as the French quater and also other places are just gorgeous, whereas the &quot;old city&quot; and everything else connected with Chinese traditions is disappointing. All in all, I loved Shanghai and hope to return one day but prefer Beijing. Apr 11 2018	Adequate for our needs	Hotel part of the Travelsphere Discover China Tour. Nothing much around the hotel and views from the hotel were of building sites. However planned activities on both nights meant that the location wasn't a problem. Supermarket across the road was brilliant for cheap beer and chocolate. Smoky in the bar area but we were on the non-smoking floor so that was OK.Rooms large and well appointed with all possible toiletries etc.Shower was good, had an enormous bath.I didn't like the hot/cold water dispenser in the room thought the water tasted strange. It seemed to take forever to boil and didn't seem that hot. I would buy alternative bottled water from the supermarket and drink that.Breakfast was adequate.A Satisfactory stay. Apr 1 2017	Plenty of sunshine in Shanghai!	If you're not after a hotel smack-bang in the middle of all the activity in Shanghai, then look no further!The Golden Jade Sunshine Hotel was great in terms of cleaniness, comfort and friendliness. Rooms were tastefully decorated &amp; large, and bathrooms had a generous shower and vanity area. If you are sensitive to smoke though, do yourself a favour and book yourself onto the non-smoking floor because people in Shanghai smoke (and spit...ugh) absolutely everywhere!It's about a 15minute taxi ride from Nanjing road and there's not really alot happening in the area around the hotel- although there's a great convinient store across the road where you can grab some 2 minute noodles for the midnight munchies.Hotel provided complimentary bottled water everyday and hotel slippers, and you can even rent a plug adaptor so you can charge your camera, phones, etc.Breakfast was a little ho-hum. Loved the variety, but everything tasted bland and oily. Typical of Shanghai food I guess, so can't complain...plus can't go out and get breakie anywhere else since there was no where else local to eat!I reccommend this hotel if you are after a quiet location to stay in, or if you're on tour or staying with young kids. Otherwise if you are after more things to do and more places to wonder in your free time, I highly reccommend staying somewhere else closer to Nanjing road. Jan 26 2017 	very nice hotel	I've stayed at Golden Jade Sunshine Hotel in Shanghai in January and I've had a great time. Hotel is situated out of the city centre but I didn't mind that much because taxis are cheap and they can get you anywhere. The neighbourhood is nice and very convenient because there are several supermarkets, a pharmacy and other amenities one can find useful. The interior of the hotel is designed in oriental style and our room was in oriental style also. The room was very comfortable and nice. The only shortcoming was that our window was overlooking a construction site just a few meters away from our hotel which made a horrible view and noise from 7am untill 4 pm. The room is equipped with satellite TV so you can watch CNN, HBO and a number of Chinese TV stations and there is also a broadband connection which is not free. Since I didn't bring my laptop with me I wanted to use the internet at the business centre but I was told that all the non-Chinese websites were not available because of some mechanical problem (!?).The staff was really nice and helpful. They spoke both English and German very well.We had a buffet breakfast which was really nice. We could choose between Chinese breakfast and a Western one.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Aug 17 2021 	???????????????????????"
"Sep 21 2021 	The WORST hotel I ever stayed in!!!	The title says it all but i will elaborate. I travel for a living so I've stayed in all manner and brand of hotels. I stay in hotels about 200 nights per year and having stayed in Mercure hotels and reading the mostly positive reviews here, I booked this hotel for a family vacation. We checked in and were impressed by the grand modern lobby. When we stepped off the elevator on 16 that's where the nightmare began. The carpet was filthy as were the baseboards and doors. This continued as we opened our rooms and were appalled at how dirty they were. The carpet was disgusting, as was the furniture. The beds were just all springs and hard as slabs. They had these disgusting fabric headboards all coated in years of head grease! The furniture was old and worn out and filthy. We didn''t even want to touch anything.The room was very poorly lit which was probably a good thing because if we had more light it would have been even more disgusting but when I turned on one of the lights mounted to the wall, it fell off and shorted out! The bathroom was a health hazard as well with mold all in my shower and dried urine and something like orange soda all over the tile. The sink was cracked in half and looked like someone poured coffee in it and never cleaned it. The other rooms we had were equally appalling! I went to the desk to ask for other rooms and was told they would be happy to move us but all the rooms were the same. Because it was 1 am and we were exhausted, we elected to stay 1 night and we checked out the next morning first thing. I wish I had taken photos to post here to protect future visitors. This hotel must be undergoing a renovation or the photos they posted are simply fraudulent because our rooms looked nothing like them and didn't even have the same decor. BEWARE! Sep 12 2021 	good value for money but far from city center	Baoshan is a district North of Shanghai. Not really much to see there. But it's a good choice if you plan on boarding a Yangtze cruise or Ocean cruise the next day. The hotel itself is quite nice. The room (superior) is quite large. The marble in the bathroom adds a nice luxury touch. The light color carpet is an odd choice as you can see some small stains. And unfortunately - like most hotels in China - the bed is quite hard. But they do offer a wide variety of pillows and staff is willing to add extra layers to soften the bed. The breakfast buffet is quite extensive and they do have a selection decent western bread. Swimming pool / fitness center offer a terrace and the lockers are clean. If you're an independent traveler I'd recommend to stay closer to city center. Don't bother to check around the hotel for sight of interest. No other restaurant are worth a visit and there is no shopping center nearby. I got a great deal booking through their internet site. Overall I'd say that it's a good choice if you need to stay in the area. Apr 6 2021	Ultra modern 5 star hotel located not too far from downtown	We stayed here 2 nights in April 2021 and are happy to say that it deserves its Grand Mercure label and 5 star rating.The rooms were spacious and well decorated. There was a reading lamp and chair together with a separate desk. It had window you could open. The bathroom had separate shower and bathtub. The only drawback was the drain in the shower which was slow to drain.Front desk service was quick and attentive. The breakfast buffet was out of this world - varyig from shrimp to sushi to omelettes. Lots of fresh fruit also. The wine selection was also amazing.The lobby bar is a feast for the eyes. Located off a highway, it is within 20 minutes driving distance from downtown Shanghai.Whatever may have been the situation before, it seems to have been corrected. We would definitely recommend this hotel without hesitation. Oct 7 2017 	Is it Grand Mercure??? Don't stay here unless you have to	I stayed this hotel for four nights. After this stay, I was wondering why this hotel is &quot;Grand Mercure&quot; and not &quot;Ibis.&quot; Just because it has &quot;executive floor&quot; doesn't make this level. The hotel said it is 5-star, but I think it is more like a 3-star. Here's my observation.Location (-1): Very difficult to find, and not in good neighborhoods. Can be reached via Line 3 (Jinwan Town)Ambience (1): I think that the hotel owner is constantly building something. Lobby is nice but the hotel's only restaurant (so to speak) Cafe 180 is too small to serve everybody (although I saw only some Chinese people partying there rather than hotel guest, and its menu are so limited. Also, the hotel has two wings. South wing is more like a traditional hotel for Chinese only. the North wing is newer but the room is more like &quot;ibis&quot; style rather than a 5-star hotel. I think that the hotel owner is also budiling another wing or may conference center but...Room (- 1 or 3 if you stay in executive floor): The hotel basically has three levels of room. One is executive floor room which is nice, the second is room in North wing which is newer and brighter but very small. Don't even have a bath tub and only shower stall. I think that even room in Four Points by Sheraton Pudong is a lot better and roomier than this one. The last one is room in South wing which is old, dirty, and most of all very dark. Also, both room in North and South wing has very weak &quot;air conditioning.&quot; Eventhough I turn the individual controler to 5 degree c, it was still hot. Reminded of old 2 - 3 star hotels for Chinese only.Staff: Trying very hard to speak but just couldn't. When I checked in, I asked I like a renovated room even though I needed to pay extra, and the check-in staff said what is &quot;renovated&quot; mean?? Also, there was a knock on the door for the second night at 7:00, and I had to woke up becaue it was so loud and had to open door. A Chinese woman handed a sheet of paper which said that the swimming pool will be closed from today for renovation. But, there was no mention when this &quot;old&quot; swimming pool will open again. And, why this woman is hammering my door rather than slip the sheet under the door. Just weired. Facility (-3): There is no facilities except some restaurants. No fitness center, no sauna or outdoor swimming pool, no nothing. Business center is small, and staffs do not understand English very well. The only option, which was indoor swimming pool was close for renovation but didn't say when it will reopen again. Strange.Total Score: -4 or -1Verdict: Should avoid unless you have to. Sep 3 2017 	OK	We spent 4 nights in this hotel and whilst the lobby etc is very modern our room was very dated and resembled a travelodge if i'm honest. Also we could hear absolutely everything that was said in the corridor and hear doors opening and closing.Breakfast was ok but very limited compared to other mercure's in China - god help you if you want eggs for example !!Overall i would say the hotel is adequate but the main drawback was the distance from the centre/tourist attractions - on average 30 Yuan taxi ride to most places and anywhere between 150-200 Yuan from the airport. Nov 19 2016	Good choice	Stayed in an executive room on the 21st. Pros: Ginormous bed, PC in room with free internet access, Lots of little perks. Friendly service. Good value for money. Breakfast has a huge selection.Cons: hotel is currently (Nov 06) being remodeled so lobby (and lower floors) may be unbearably loud. Called for room service at midnight - brochure says small selection available all night, but was told it was closed. First day reported for breakfast at 6:30 - food was out but most of it was cold as the heaters underneath hadn't burned turned on.A taxi to Yuyuan gardens set me back 28 yuan and took 30 minutes or so during non-rush hour traffic. It was preferable to taking the metro - the nearest station to the hotel is a 15 minute walk up the roadI would stay here again. May 30 2016	Great Value	Out of city centre but 1st class. Well equipped, clean rooms. Efficient, helpful staff. Laundry service good value.Excellent breakfast. Would recommend. Nov 3 2021	Gutes Hotel...wurde im August in einigen Etagen renoviert Oct 12 2021 	bon hôtel pas très bien situé Mar 5 2021 	?????????????????"
"Oct 11 2021 	A 4-Star Hotel with 2.5-Star Service	Location: It is located outside of “inner circle highway” or of downtown area. One has to take a taxi to go anywhere. Although Shanghai Taxi is not expensive, the traffic jam and unavailability of taxi near the hotel often makes a trip to somewhere become a headache (there is Starbuck two blocks away however). Facilities: The hotel is relatively new. The lobby area is small, because most part used as a bar, with bench against a divider for customers to sit (you get the picture). The room is relatively small, but well equipped (the room we had has a washer). No comments on food (We usually don’t eat at hotel restaurant). Service: Here is the problem. We booked it because it’s a 5-star hotel (actually I found later that some travel sites list it as a 4-star) and expected a 5-star service. First, while there are one or two employees at the entrance, none opened the taxi door or helped with our luggage when we arrived (we didn’t need it anyway). When checking-in, we were told the double room we booked was not available and only twin rooms were available. Based on my experiences, almost all US brand hotels will provide next grade room instead; but not this hotel. Both front desk girl and the manager talked in a polite, but business-like, tone (certainly not a 5-star, or any star, hotel business tone) and were firm about the twin room. Their excuse was all double were booked. Based on my observation later, the hotel was not even half full (It was a Saturday). Since we just had a 15-hour flight and didn’t have the energy to go to next level manager or find another hotel; and settled for a twin room. We moved to Hyatt on the Bund next day.In summary, the hotel’s facilities are a 4-star and the service is 2- or 3-star. If one has a business in Hongqiao, it is OK to stay (but there is a Sheraton near-by). Otherwise, there are so many others available with competitive rate, and much better location and serivces. Oct 9 2021 	Basically good	It may be a little far from downtown, but still a good place to stay. Rooms are equipped with a washing machine, which came in handy towards the end of my trip where i wanted to get some laundry done before heading home (so you don't have to do a whole pile when you get back). Rooms are clean and comes with all the toiletries and standard accessories any good hotel should have. Service is generally good. Housekeeping is efficient but knowing how to speak mandarin will come in handy when requesting items from them. They greet you in english but can't say anything else in beyond &quot;Hello, Housekeeping&quot;. When at breakfast, do be warned of a certain young chap who is in charge of the eggs section. Very unfriendly to non-caucasians with a nonchalant attitude. Not a great way to start your mornings. Apr 28 2021 	Really great for those traveling in groups	Grand Mercure Hotel in Shanghai had everything we wanted! Eight of us went to Shanghai for the weekend to have a little food tour and we wanted to stay together &amp; not be separated into too many rooms. I know not many hotels offer suites for four people, until I came across Grand Mercure. I found out the hotel just opened in 2017, which meant everything’s bound to be fresh and new. My friends and I decided to get two suites, with four people occupying each room. We were given a suite that had generous space and contained two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, a dining area &amp; a fully-equipped kitchen that even had a washing machine. One suite was priced at around RMB 4000.00 for three nights already. It was definitely value for our money. A definite plus is the hotel’s Lv Feng Chinese Restaurant. Since we’re on a food tour of Shanghai, we decided to give the hotel’s own restaurant a try. The food was a bit costly compared to other Shanghai food spots but we were aware that we’re in a 5-star hotel’s dining establishment. We ordered dim sum and a variety of other Chinese dishes and they did not disappoint our group. I compliment the chef for using fresh ingredients and avoiding the usual downfall of Chinese food—extreme oiliness. All in all, our dining experience satisfied us and our tummies. I would definitely go back to Grand Mercure Hotel when I return to Shanghai for another vacation. Apr 18 2021 	Good hotel but far from downtown	Decent hotel as I paid around 85.00 a night but taxi ride to downtown is about 7 dollars. Our room had one wall that was peeling wood. Clean bathroom and nice bed. Balcony was not allowed to use. Dec 14 2018 	Rooms need an update	The lobby is beautiful! Very modern. But the rooms need an update. It seems like all the money went into the lobby &amp; restaurant. The Bed was very hard. It was a shock to sit on the bed. You actually sleep on a piece of wood and a box spring. There is no mattress. The bathroom is fine and the shower is the best part of the room. You can hear people opening and closing doors all night long. Walls are very thin and if you face the street, traffic noise is annoying. Dec 11 2018 	Great Deal	I had two nights stay at this hotel, very nice sleep, the bed was fantastic. Staffs' service was good and helpful. Nov 25 2018 	Great place for 2-week stay	Stayed here for work trip with a large group of associates. Overall, nice hotel, with very comfortable room and at a great rate (US$80 / night).Location is OK -- kind of a long walk to the closest subway, but close to restaurants and shops. Relatively central to Hongqiao.Had to put up with the usual strange Shanghai occurrences...occasional strange smells wafting through the hotel, the washer/dryers in the room didn't work, and I was called in the room for &quot;massage&quot; more than once.Staff was super-friendly. Food in restaurant was overpriced by Shanghai standards -- 5 min walk would take you to many better options. Dec 1 2017 	Food a Let Down	Service in general is excellent: housekeeping was efficient and friendly except for one room maid who displayed acute annoyance when she failed to understand my request for a tea bag. Concierge was helpful. My room was spacious but although it has a kitchen there is no cookware, crokery or cutlery provided. I find the provision of a washing machine a great asset. I would give them four stars but the food and beverage department needs to lift their game.First, only ONE cup of tea/coffe is provided with the buffet - and the extra charge for an extra cup of tea/coffee is 50% of the cost of the buffet (they explained that it is to discourage people from ordering a coffee and sit there all day; for the same reason they charge for water). The food quality was sub-standard - I was served chicken that was seared on the outsdie and RAW on the inside. The rice congee was lumpy and barely warm (when I complained I was told this is the way they eat it). The service staff was polite but talk to each other over your head across the dining room as if you're not there (admittedly I was the only one there - staying too long, I suppose). Oct 15 2017 	Recommanded for groups!!	Everything we wanted!! Eight of us went to Shanghai for the weekend to watch the F1 Grand Prix and we wanted to stay together &amp; not separated into too many rooms. Not many hotels offer suites for 4 until I came cross to this hotel. As it only opened for few months everything was new. Great size suite, over 1000sq, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room, dining area &amp; a fully equipped kitchen (even with a washing machine). So we took two suits, each suit was around 4000Yuen (3 nights) = US$530. Great value as it works out only 1000Yuen each for the whole stay. At the beginning, my main concern was the location of the hotel. It is not in the heart of Shanghai, around 15mins away by taxi. The hotel is just off the high-way which takes you to central and we didn't experience any traffic while we were there. Although it may sound far but honestly if you stay in a hotel in town, you will spend more time stuck in traffic on the small streets of Shanghai. Cab fare from hotel cost around 40 Yuen. Another pros is that it is close to the race track... great for a grand prix weekend!! Will definitely go back to stay if traveling in a group again!! Jul 18 2017	Very good experience...	I stayed at the Grand Mercure in Shanghai for just 1 night but it was amazing. I only paid $89 for a twin room for me and a friend and its rated as 5 star so that was a good start. When we arrived there was plenty of staff on hand to help us out the taxi and take our luggage. Hotel reception was beutiful with a lovely bar/seating area and bakery. Reception staff were all very friendly as well and spoke good English. On the way up in the lift i found out from the bell boy that the hotel had only opened on July 1st so it was onlyaround 2 weeks old! The room was very nice, it wasnt the biggest room but it was well laid out. We had a flat screen tv, mini bar, microwave, 2 hobs (plus extractor fan) and even a washing machine!! Very unusual for a hotel. The room was basically brand new so that added to the greatnesss of it all. I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a luxury stay but doesnt want to break the bank. 5/5 Nov 17 2021 	??????????? Oct 27 2021 	??????????… Sep 27 2021 	???????????

"Nov 16 2021 	Should be higher up the rankings. Perfect Location	This hotel is great. In the french concession area. 5mins from Hengshan road metro station, 10mins on metro to Peoples square. 5 mins the other way to lots of shops and stuff. Beautiful park with black swans across the road. Nice pubs in walking distance. Dont stay near the Bund or city centre...too much building work and dust! This is great, nice big rooms, and HUGE breakfast if you so want. But theres a cafe across teh road which is very popular Oct 16 2021 	Good Value and Services	It's an excellent place for bussiness user, easy to reach location with nice size of room. The internet is fast and no extra charge at all. Complimentary juice and fruits are thoughful and shows extra care. Staff are warm and helpful. May 25 2021 	nice hotel in a good location	I have visited Shanghai many times before and this was my stay here. The hotel is an an excellent location. There are two sub-way lines close by - Hengshan Road and another one. There is a huge tree-line park opposite the hotel and and close by is the Xujajai (sic) shopping area. There was a McDonalds and KFC there. In addition Hengshan road has a huge number of bars. There are good dining choices on this road. We had a Brazilian night buffet for some 95 RMB. The in-hotel dining is OK, but by Chinese standards I have been less expensive hotels with far more elaborate choices. The breakfast buffet is a good choice of western and chinese and some Japanese fair. Service in the hotel was excellent but horrendous in the buffet. It is overstaffed and the waiters would go about doing their work mechanically and never made eye contact with customers. You could be waiting endlessly for a coffee refill and no one would notice. I think the hotel definitely needs to work on the training aspect. Waiters and all staff at the hotel were very polite. The internet connection was excellent. Good wi-fi downstairs and wired connection upstairs. They had a tiny business area where they did not have a color printer (weird). A common theme I noticed in China was that carpets are poorly kept. I am yet to see a hotel with clean and spotless carpets. That said I would definitely stay there again. May 23 2021 	Can't think of a better hotel in Shanghai	This hotel is located in the heart of the French Concession area. From your room window you can see all that Shanghai has to offer: impressive high-rises along side typical Chinese life. It's a short walk to the subway or otherwise a quick cab ride to all the touristy spots in Shanghai. (Added bonus if you don't speak Chinese: the cab drivers all seem to know exactly where the hotel is) Around the corner on Hengshan Lu (5 minute walk) is also a great (and cheap) Chinese restaurant. The room we had was incredibly spacious and comfortable - it was a great place to return to and relax after a day of discovering Shanghai. (We actually had a corner room so more windows = more light and more view) The breakfast at the hotel is amazing, staff is extremely helpful and friendly. I miss it! Dec 15 2018 	nice hotel	I stayed two weeks at this hotel, and it is in the good location, subway just 5 mins walk and big shopping centers are 10-15 mins walk. The hotel room is really clean and in good condition. Good rain shower in the bath room. The services are really good, people are very polite there.I stayed in the executive level, which having free afternoon tea and internet access. this hotel seems like business travel hotel, but still very nice for the holiday travellers.I will definately come back to this hotel. Jul 16 2018 	Excellent value and quality	Stayed here in July 2017 when it was being refurbished and it was noisy. Refurb now complete, new foyer, reception and dining room. Friendly staff who speak good English. Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice. Bedrooms well equipped with en-suite, large television, internet access, ironing board etc. Hotel facilities good. Good value or money. Taxis very reasonable, trip to the bund £2.50. Metro station 5 minutes walk. Would recommend to friends and family. Jul 21 2017 	Stay away	I am still staying at Hengshan Hotel right now. I spent here the last 5 nights.They are doing a complete renovation right now - but didn't tell me when we made the booking by telephone.Today, Sunday at 6am it was impossible to find some sleep in my room ( 8th (Executive) Floor ) because of the heavy noise caused by the workers. The management refuses any compensation - well, the internet access in the room is free of charge *laughing*Breakfast at executive lounge is fair... and as above already mentioned - leaves much space for improvements.In the services directory they write, that executive lounge is open until 10pm - at 9pm it is already closed.I am deeply disappointed... will not stay here again. Apr 17 2017 	Nice hotel	Stayed here on 2 seperate occasions for 3 nights in total during our 2 weeks in China. Both rooms were large and very comfortable with allthe amenities you'd expect from a 4* hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful and stored our bags for 3 days during our trip to the mountains. Were even able to check in early (9am) on our return.Only downside for us was the location. Although the area is good and close to some nice bars and places to eat, in hindsight we'd have booked somewhere a bit closer to the bund as this is where most of the tourist attractions are. Would have meant less travelling on the extreamly packed shanghai metro system.Taxi's are easy to find though and very very cheap so not a huge problem and it was a very nice hotel. Dec 1 2016 	I enjoyed the Hengshan	My company booked this for me, so I have no idea what price I paid.The room was huge, it seemed to be at an intersection of 2 wings, so was an irregular shape, but big.The bed, too was large and good.The outstanding part of this hotel was the air conditioning. I stayed at the hottest and most humid time of the year, and have to say that the air con was the best! Fanstastically cool. I had my breakfast in a strange room, it seems to be all internal, so no windows, just artificial light. As others have said, the food was OK - ish, I have had better breakfasts in Shanghai.Location is what it is. Nice enough area, a park opposite that was good to walk in and watch the early morning exercises and activities, although the humidity soon got the better of me.The main road that the hotel is on has some good shops and local restaurants. I found some great antiques in a junk shop about 500m up the road.Would I stay again:For breakfast, No.If I had the same bedroom again, Yes.If it was very hot and humid: Oh Yes! Jul 26 2016	Not 4 Star but Adequate	I stayed at this hotel in July 2015 and found it to be very good. However, needing a hotel during a business trip, I discovered the hotel service to have changed significantly. First the good:Cheap price. My rate was 590 RMB (about 65 Euros).Good locationRoom size is large for european standards.Bad:Room was dirty, especially the carpet and bathroomBreakfast buffet was lacking. I got there at 9:00 and it had not been restocked (all the fruit was gone) There were 5 waitresses standing around talking and I had to get my own coffee.The employees don't seem to care about customers, or in providing customer service (untypical of Asia).I will stay somewhere else during my next visit. Apr 11 2016 	Hard Beds but clean rooms	The hotel is nice and clean, but the beds are super firm. The breakfast buffet leaves a lot of room for improvement but for the price it is quite reasonable. Oct 29 2015 	OK for the price	Stayed for one night in this hotel. Although Lonely Planet stated that it was located in an historical apartment building it was not so visible anymore. The environment of Hengshan Lu in the French concession is nice, especially if you like western style restaurants, pubs and bars.I got upgraded and the room was good. The furniture shows some wear and tear and the plumbing was not the best.All in all, if you can get a rate around 800 RMB/80 Euro it is good value. Feb 2 2015	the pluses outweigh the minuses	I stayed at the hotel for a week in Jan 05. When i got there they told me they cancelled my reservation, and were booked but had a small room if i wanted it and could change rooms the next day. first i have to tell you about this room. it's smaller than rooms in europe, absolutely tiny and shaped like a rectangle so it was slightly uncomfortable. luckily i was by myself, i don't think i could have shared it with anyone. if they offer you room 1009, just say no. the bathroom was just funny. it was so narrow that i could really walk straight inside. however, i did get moved the next day to a larger room. the beds are very firm. i like that so i had a wonderful sleep, but if you need a soft bed, this may not be a place for you. the bathrooms used a shower curtain and it may have been me, but i kept getting water all over the ground, plus the water didn't drain as quickly as i would have liked and i thought i saw some places that could have been cleaned better. The location is great. was safe and quiet. i saw the dancing at night and tai chi in the morning. very serene and different from the hustle and bustle of the city. every taxi driver i met knew the hotel and where it was so no problems there. the staff speaks very little if any english though i saw a lot of non-asians at the hotel. i'm not sure how they got their questions answered. if you want to brush up on your chinese, or like learning how to communicate in different languages you would enjoy this. but let me say that the staff is very nice and helpful and went more out of their way then some 4 or 5 star hotels i've stayed at. but the hotel did have these cards with english and chinese translations of major tourist spots and the hotel address. bring that with you and you'll have all the major stuff covered. the one annoying thing was that the maids would come by at 8:30 in the morning which i think is a little too early for cleaning. the hotel is a nice walk to shopping and restaurants. for the price, this was better than i expected in an expensive city. Dec 4 2004	Good value and great location for local flavor	We stayed here about a week last spring at the suggestion of a friend who has a company in Shanghai and spends half his time here. He offered 2 places but said we might like this one better because it was in a &quot;quiet&quot; location. We thought we might want to be where the action was, but when we got there we realized what he meant. Shanghai is a frenzy, packed, loud, shoving crowds. Unlike the big chain hotels, the Hengshan is in an older established neighborhood in the best section of town: the French concession. It is a tree-lined street with some of the older French villas nearby. The hotel is in the area where guidebooks have scenic walk itineraries. It is across the street from 2 parks, a large one with public dancing at night, and a small local one. We liked the small park - in the morning you can see oldies doing tai chi or getting their excercise dancing to 1930's music. The hotel is a remake of the old Picardie apartment, so the rooms are enormous with high ceilings and (some) balconies. They have a classic 1930's feel, not artificial but authentic with a well-lived-in feel. Unfortunately, there are no no-smoking rooms so you can't get one that's totally odor-free. The beds and furnishings are of moderate quality. The bathrooms are large, with new marble tiles and fixtures (including separate glass shower stall) but look like they had been designed by an amateur. Clunky. Westerners shouldn't have a problem with the cleanliness or the toiletries. The staff don't speak much English so you can't rely on them for sightseeing help. But they are friendly and trustworthy. You'll feel secure here. We didn't eat there as there are local restaurants with real local Shaghainese food. Due to jet lag, we woke at 5am and would head out to either the steamed dumpling shop or the fried dumpling stand, which open at 6am - each about 2 blocks away in opposite directions from the hotel. For about 50 cents, you can get a holf dozen of the best dumplings in the world. We ate these in copious amounts every morning. There's also one of the biggest internet cafes nearby, with about 120 computers. You get a fast connection to your email for about 50 cents an hour. About 2 blocks away is a subway stop, and there begins the posher restaurants. A few blocks away is a major shopping district with huge department stores. With taxis cheap and the subway nearby, it's easy to get to the major tourist sites, yet be able to retire to your &quot;neighborhood&quot; at the end of the day. In summary, this hotel isn't for those who are looking for a U.S.-type glass and steel hotel. It's for those who want something cheaper and more in tune with the culture and history of the city, and who are indpendent (i.e., not dependent on hotel staff for arrangements). Nov 18 2021 	ganz passabel - Spa im Hotel nicht zu empfehlen!!! Sep 15 2018 	Ein furchtbares Hotel in einer Stadt voller erstklassiger Alternativen! Sep 10 2018	na ja"
"Sep 6 2021 	Express indeed	For US $120 more or less for 3 nights stay, its value indeed! Be ready to deal with the staff, some do not speak english...prepare to talk chingrish and communicate like talking to a baby. That we dont mind, its one of the adventures you go through when you're in mainland China. Things turned out well though. Left our luggage with them when we travelled to Hangzhou. There is also a free internet in the lobby.Nonetheless, the Holiday Inn Express has all what you ask for from the hotel, sans the excess (pool, ref, mini bar , room service et al) Breakfast was fine - it came with set meals, basic eggs, hard boiled eggs in hot tea, sausages &amp; bacon, congee, simple veggies and breads. Also comes with coffeee, teas, juice.Rooms are small but clean. Bed and sheets are great too. Hotel also has free laundromat. The hood's safe even at night. Its situated in front of the creek and the location is not commuter friendly. Some Shanghai cabbies do not know where it is. It is also near Carrefour. It is suggested that you ask the front desk . It is also around 10 to 15 mins walk to the nearest train station. Cabs in Shanghai are also cheap. If you get hungry in the middle of the night, there aint many joints open nearby. Front desk offered a McDonalds delivery but we declined. We're in Shanghai and we'll eat McDo? :( May 25 2021 	Hotel Review - Holiday Inn Express Putuo Shanghai	Nice Hotel at an affordable rate in Shanghai. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is basic. The rooms were noisy from all the new construction especially early in morning. Short walking distance to many restaurants and Carrefour. The only drawback is access to taxis, this is my second time in 2 years staying at this hotel and many taxis do not know where it is located. As well taxis do not hang around this hotel, so tell the hotel if you need a taxi in advance.ThanksMartin May 20 2021 	worth to stay	a memorable stay in shanghai, the cleanness of the lobby and room is the most satisfied. Feb 28 2021 	Not the best location in Shanghai	Hotel is 8kms from central area and taxi drivers find it diificult to locate.Failed to call a taxi to the hotel but managed with difficulty to return.Taxis are very cheap however.Construction work taking place on both sides of hotel.Access to main road is rough and takes 10 mins.Rooms are spacious,double bed clean and very comfortable.Electricity can go off from time to time.Some western style food available in cafeteria.Difficult to find restaurants within walking distance although there was a good one at the China Greeen hotel [about 20mins] also Starbucks in the same vicinity. Sep 29 2018	Hated the Holiday Inn getting out ASAP	Construction Site! Do not stay here, huge diggers operating throughout the early hours! plus this hotel is Miles away from Shanghai City, Taxi drivers have a job finding it. I'm moving out today after 2 terrible nights pre-booked 380rmb not worthy! Apr 14 2018 	new hotel	i have stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, i should say that the hotel looks quite new specially the interior of building is quite in a new shape.the rooms are in a good size all having a writing desk and a small sofa. you receive comlimentary tea and coffee plus two bottles of water every day. also the bathroom is in a good state.talking about the breakfast, we had this included in the room rate but i should say it wasn't the best breakfast, you had less choice but both chinese and western. just like most of the hotels in china the staff had a real language difficulty.the main down-point on this hotel is the location, eventhough it's quite close to the metro on line 3 (5 minutes walk) but you have to go through a poor area and maybe for a tourist it doesn't look great. also the hotel is located at the end of a narrow road which most of the taxis think it's dead end.all in all i liked this hotel. specially the price was right for the quality. Mar 22 2018 	A Standard Business Hotel	This property is not located in Shanghai city. It is a 25 minute car ride from the city during non-peak hours (11pm). During peak hours, expect a longer drive.If you are a tourist to Shanghai, I do not suggest you stay here as the distance is unbearable. Hotels in Shanghai city are not as expensive as HKG, so i suggest you give this hotel a miss. You will not regret it as the distance can be rather daunting. Traveling after a long flight, you do not want to go through bad traffic throughout your stay.Breakfast is very miserable. Rooms are clean, but very tiny. Nov 27 2017	Great Hotel ... Out of the way though	This property is a solid 3.5* hotel, located in the suburb.Rooms: very new, clean rooms, sheets changed daily, triple sheets, giant shower box, bright, and curtains that overlap so you can sleep in properly. Bottled water provided daily.Excellent free buffet breakfast: fruit, veggie, toasts, Chinese congee, chow fan noodle are available as well as three main courses to choose from (beef noodle soup, fried rice, and western style - eggs, hash brown, and bacon).Free internet: three computer stations are available in the lobby as well as free wifi.Location: It's a bit out of the way. Most cab drivers cannot find it without the hotel name card. The check in agent will give you a card when you check in and use this to show the cab driver. Cab is about 30RMB to Nanjing Road and 60RMB to JinMao in Pudong side. Ride to Maglev station is about 70RMB.I'll stay here again if the price is right. Sep 26 2017 	Good service but getting expensive...	Was forced to stay this hotel for almost two weeks due to unexpected travel glitches. Overall, I enjoyed stay in this hotel. &quot;Price&quot; was very reasonable. It was only RMB330 nett including free breakfast and internet a night. This rate now went up to RMB380 nett. The hotel is very new and provide shuttle services to Jongsan Park station (Metro Line 2, 3, 4) four times (8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30) during week day.Also, the hotel's &quot;Great Room&quot; restaurant offers a number of set menu for both lunch and dinner, and they are around RMB 20 to 30. The hotel staffs said that it used to have laundry room but got rid of it. Too bad.. Also, one of the biggest Carrefour is just across the street although it take some time to figure out how to get there.However there are some areas of improvement1) Location: Very remote area, and hard to find. Even cab drivers have trouble. Use &quot;Uning ru&quot; and &quot;Kwangpusi ru&quot;2) Renovation??: The hotel is constantly in construction...3) English??: Although hotel staffs tried to understand but most hotel staffs have very limited ability, and just speak in Chinese. Leverage &quot;survival English&quot; like &quot;shuttle&quot;4) Too many group travellers: Well can't help but...Also, I think that the overall price of this hotel will increase rapidly. Already RMB50 increase.. Sep 24 2017	Above Average	Positives:1) Clean, modern looking rooms2) Clean bathrooms - good showers.3) Free Internet4) Front desk will call cabs for you5) Free breakfast - though mostly Chinese-type breakfast. There are eggs and toast as well.Slight Negatives:1) Taxis don't normally know the location of the hotel even with an address. Would suggest to bring a map that indicates the location of the hotel. Keep in mind there are several Holiday Inns in Shanghai so may be confusing for the taxi driver. Cab ride to Nanjing Road about RMB25-30.2) Water has funny smell. I used the free bottles of water they provided to brush my teeth. May 27 2017	EHI Experiance	I enjoyed my two week stay at the Express by Holiday Inn in Shanghai. The hotel is new and very clean, it was also very quite. Some people do not like the location but taxi's are easy to come by in Shanghai and this hotel's rates were reasonable. The buffet breakfast was good. The staff that works at the front desk speak very good English and are very helpful. The air conditioning in the room did not work great but was not terrible. I have been told by people who travel to China often that the air conditioning in most places does not work very well. The internet service on the computers in the business center also do not work very well but I was able to get into my e-mail most days I was there. I would reccomed this hotel to anyone who is visiting Shanghai and does not have a problem traveling around via taxi cab. Nov 12 2021 	??????????????? Sep 29 2021 	????????????

"Nov 22 2021 	top value	If you don't mind taking the Metro and waking short distances, then the Jinqiao HIE is for you. Shanghai is a rather pricey town and this accommodation stands for value. In my opinion --- a good location -just around the corner from Carrefour, an excellent takeout sushi stand and a couple fast food places. Yes, it is possible to Metro, Maglev in from Pudong-- I did it on the way back. From this hotel to Pudong airport- and with one wheeled suitcase ( not tons of luggage) just take Metro from Jufeng (line 6) to Longyang station ( line 2) and get on the Maglev straight to Pudong. Get more info if you google this route, and save some $$$. Oh yes ---FYI on the way IN from Pudong as taxi drivers seem to have a hard time finding this place. ...bring a map!!!! Nov 3 2021 	Good Hotel for a business traveler and good value for the money spent; but could do better with a good restaurant.	I stayed in this hotel with my colleagues on and off for around seven days. A neat and decent hotel with some of the staff communicating in English. The hotel is a bit away from the main business centers. But for a few of the travelers who would prefer a quiet evening after a busy day, this could mean a blessing in disguise. The only major draw back is a lack of good restaurant. The one in the hotel has limited service, but extends good hospitality. While a departmental stores and ATMs are around the corner, there are no good restaurants nearby. And if you happen to be a vegetarian the fruit shop in front of the hotel is a boon. Sep 17 2021 	Good value for money	I wanted an inexpensive hotel for a 2-night stopover in Shanghai, and this hotel gave me what I wanted. The room was good - would have been great if the English TV channels had worked! They had the usual BBC /CNN etc listed, but No Signal was all you got if you selected them. I understood what some other travellers have said about hard beds, but it wasn't ultra-hard: I like a mattress on the hard side, and for me it was perfect.The hotel is about 250 metres from the Metro station: go down the stairs from the station and walk straight along the road (past the taxi stand), over the river, and the hotel is on your left. It is very walkable if you don't have heavy luggage - you can see the hotel from the station.Getting in and out of the city is easy via Metro. I used the Maglev and Metro to get from the airport to the hotel, but decided to take a taxi on the return journey, and would definitely recommend that: only about 120 yuan and it took only half the time and one tenth of the hassle! (Get the airport info lady to write the name and address of the hotel in Chinese.)Next to the hotel is a supermart, plus a couple of cafes: I ate in one of them and had a delicious meal for about 2 pound.A big plus was the free internet in the room (and there are computers in the foyer if you don't have a laptop). The minuses were lack of English-language TV; and there was no porter, so you have to get your luggage to / from your room yourself.I was put off by others' description of the breakfast so didn't go down the first morning; and kicked myself on the second morning, as I had a delicious meal of savoury rice with absolutely delicious green beans. Not what I'd normally have for breakfast, but it was so yummy - I wanted the recipe and I seldom cook! If you want European, you can have toast, boiled eggs, small sausages, and ham. Jul 30 2021 	Out of the way but a fantastic value	The hotel is a ways outside of the busy part of shanghai, but easily eached via Line 6 on the Shanghai subway system (which is very new and modern). Easy to get here from the airport via train; no need to take a taxi. Hotel itself is very clean and modern, offers free internet access in the lobby, and has a nice free breakfast every morning. Very nice staff, most of whom speak enough english. KFC and supermarket right around the corner; also a good haircut place across the street. East side of hotel can see Pudong on a clear day. Very good AC and beds. Really the only disadvantage is the distance from central Shanghai, otherwise this is a great place to stay. Jul 25 2021 	Great Value stopover	Hotel is about 500m from the Metro, (Jufeng station), not 200m as stated on the HI Express website so it takes about 6-7minutes to walk although there are no roads to cross. There is a Carrefour supermaket next door with a KFC and Younge King (Chinese fast food). Hotel is a nice example of a HI Express, but as in other hotels in China they have an issue with the kids eat free policy and/or try to charge for kids in the room, which is one of the key benefits of HI Express for familes. Keep a hard copy of your booking which clearly infers that children are included to prove the point.Allow and hour to transfer to/from the airport by MagLev and Metro, though you will probably make it in less. May 12 2021 	Excellent Hotel and very cheap! Internet was free!!!	Very good and modern decor. Not close to attractions, but we just stayed one night for a long layover. It's not very close to the airport either, maybe 30 mins by taxi. In hindsight we should have taken the train from the airport, it was so easy and much faster and cheaper. Taxi cost like 120 yuan. bed was hard as most are in china, but service was excellent and hotel was very clean! May 6 2021 	Excellent	This hotel is not so close to the city centre and to the main attractions, but metro line 6 station (Jufeng road) is only 2 minutes walk away from the hotel. The ticket price from Longyang road (Maglev station) only costs 3 yuan per person. The highest metro fare was 6 yuan to Qibao which is on the other side of the Town. The location is perfect, next to the hotel is a carrefour supermarket, a KFC and an excellent Chinese restaurant called Yongheking. The only negative point with the hotel is the breakfast. If you like Chinese-style breakfast (fried rice, noodle, and other vegies) than it's good for you, if not than toast with jam will be boring after a week or longer. The rooms are perfect and big enough for travellers. And also very quite and clean. May 1 2021 	good basic hotel	My husband stayed in this hotel for nine days. It is realy cheap but clean. Build few years ago so everything in still new. Just 10 minutes walk to subway(metro). No attractions around but good for someone who needs clean hotel for little money. Oct 19 2021 	?????????"
"Better than expected - comfortable and easy and would go back.	stayed 20 daysGood points-hotel is much better than average Holiday Inn - has a swank feel about atrium and decor in public areas.friendly staffgood size room with stylish decorexcellent business loungeindoor swimming pool but heavily chlorinated and in need of some tlc or revampbad points -hotel appears to tolerate a couple of spivs offering sex with local ladies who hang around on pavement right outside hotel so expect to be asked if you want massage with happy ending with good time ladies everytime you leave the hotel. 2 individuals in particular wre there every day for 3 weeks.Irish bar is very empty apart from a smattering of local ladies. Nov 18 2021 	New and nice	This was my first trip to a Holiday Inn for some time and I was positively surprised. The hotel was brand new and of very good quality, not your usual Holiday Inn standard. Nov 4 2021 	Good mid-range hotel in Pudong	I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights for a business trip. On arrival check-in was fast and efficient. I had travelled to China on an overnight flight, and arrived at the hotel at around 9am in the morning. I was able to check straight-in, and was only charged a ‘half day’ for the early check-in, and was still offered the inclusive breakfast.The room was of a reasonable size on the 27th floor, and very quiet. Bathroom was also of a reasonable size, with a square ‘two person’ size tub and overhead shower. The ‘flat screen’ TV had a good selection of channels, including CNN News channel and BBC World News.Internet is via cable, and charged at 1 RMB/min (up to a maximum charge of 80 RMB in a 24 hour period). Within the room, the power sockets are configured so that they conveniently take British, European and US plugs.Breakfast is served on the ground floor via a buffet, and offers a 50:50 split between western and Chinese cuisines. Overall the selection was good, and the service received was fast and efficient. There is also a chef on both cuisine sides to cater for individual requests.The hotel has few in house restaurants/bars. Flannagan’s, an Irish bar on the ground floor seems to be popular with single business travellers, and they have a regular live band. Also on the ground floor, where breakfast is served, is another restaurant. However there is no noticeable difference between this restaurant, Flannagan’s and room service in terms of menu options. I did try a Japanese restaurant on the second floor, which I believe offers a sort of Japanese/fusion experience. So you can order usual Japanese sushi favourites, along with western dishes all shaped in small portions (e.g. potatoes/cheese croquets and egg omelette pieces etc). Location wise the hotel is situated on one of the main roads through the Pudong district, and is a good location if you want to be in the area. However, if you need to be in the financial centre, or the main shopping areas, I would choose a hotel closer to that area (although a taxi journey to and from those districts costs only £2-3) but could take a while if you’re travelling in rush-hour and need to use the tunnel connecting both sides of the river.Overall I was very satisfied with the stay at the hotel. If you want to go “higher-end” then there is a St Regis situated right next door to the Holiday Inn which could be worth considering. Sep 14 2021 	Great hotel crappy food	Stayed on the 32nd floor, in an awesome room. The best thing was the 2 person bathtub which I enjoyed everynight after walking the dirty streets of Shanghai. The room was very clean and the hotel felt safe. The internet was even reliable, expensive, but reliable.The only down side to this hotel was their food. The room service food was, well, interesting. I ordered pizza, and got one with an egg yolk in the middle even though it didn't say that on the menu. It made me sick even though I scraped the yolk off. The next night they gave me cocoa powder in my pepper shaker. I didn't notice until after I had put it on my noodles.I tried the karaoke bar, which I was the only person there. When I asked if there were other hotel guests there the girl brought out 6 more girls in matching outfits and said &quot;usually girls don't ask for girls&quot; that was NOT what I meant, so I left and went downstairs to the Irish Pub to get a beer and listen to the great treat of a Chinese band doing Van Halen.Other than that, great hotel. Jul 27 2021 	Great Holiday Inn!	All good, staff, breakfast, rooms and fantastic beds (nice and soft rather than the usually hard beds in most Fast East hotels). We liked this hotel.A little out from the centre but taxis not expensive and lots of local facilities. Jun 26 2021 	Nicely redecorated almost new hotel	Most of the hotel is newly renovated, they really did a nice job. Rooms are comfortable, beds are good, bathroom excellent with a large shower / bathtub.Some small issues: Internet - you can buy a 24 hour pass, however if during your 24 hours you log off and then on again, you do not get told how much time you have left. Hence I had 4 times 24 hour charges on my bill, but I only used the system 2 days. But with out argue it was taken off the bill. Skype works, but iChat does not, unfortunately.Speed is average.Coffeeshop food is somewhat limited, breakfast also quite limited and expensive for what is offered.BUT I for sure will stay there again. Favourite hotel on the Pudong site. Jun 21 2021 	Good hotel	The Holiday Inn Pudong was a good place to stay during my brief visit of Shanghai in September 2014. From what I remember the rooms were very good (although I was in an Executive room). Good views from the room windows too. Would recommend. Jun 5 2021 	Good Hotel but careful on the rip off spa service!	Everything was great except the massage service. This is extortion. They should be ashamed of the prices they charged. 6000 RMB is not acceptable for any type of service.Will not stay here again just because of this.Also, I wanted to swim and the pool staff could not answer my question - they didn't speak english and were not willing to explain anything. I didn't end up swimming. May 21 2021 	Great hotel  Location so-so..	Like everything in life it’s about the ratio between what you get and what you pay.Let’s start from the basics: I stayed paying the hotels weekend rate of about $75 (exclusive breakfast and internet connection) for this price it’s a deal hard to beat.. (Their official weekday price is $225+)The room was excellent, elegant, clean and comfortable, a desk for work very useful. Breakfast rich and tasty (was not included), the overall hotel (lobby etc) very elegant and nice.Location is so-so, all is accessible by cab, still in the morning rush hour getting to the center can take 35- 45 Min. For vacation or leisure absolutely a steal for less than $100, business traveler consider what it will take in the morning drive. My recommendation, don’t hesitate to email or call and try to get if for less than $150 (1000-1200 RMB), for $200+ check and compare with other options.. May 9 2021 	HI Pudong = Great value for money!	great value for money!clean rooms, good location for business travelers. Apr 30 2021 	Must be one of the world's best Holiday Inns	From the warmth of the smiles, and the treatment as a special guest of this hotel, the Holiday Inn Pudong stay was darned near perfect. The lobby radiated happy employees. They are well trained and enjoy their jobs. You can tell after just a few moments. So before you even wonder if there is an Priority Club (PC) upgrade or what the room looks like, you feel special.The upgrade was provided. The &quot;Customer Experience Manager&quot; was behind the PC check-in desk and said the management was very happy I decided on their Holiday Inn. He said they were proud of their new rooms and he personally escorted us to the room with the bellman and the bags. (I said to myself, maybe they know I write these reviews, but then after seeing all the recent top five-bullet ratings for this hotel, I realized they just treat their guests right!)The room was superior in the truest sense. A corner room, it was not huge, but comfortable, light and very modern with a huge bath area and tub for two. The staff people remembered my name, albeit in a Chinese way, calling me Mr. Robert throughout my stay. Not just one, but a handful of employees memorize your name or do a really fast check on the computer to make sure they address you personally. Again, they are trained to make you feel special. As a Trip Advisor Destination Expert, I have been in many Shanghai hotels, and this one went all out in customer service.The location in Pudong is a neutral factor in my opinion. You are a short two block walk to subway Line 4, just one stop from Line 2 (downtown and Maglev station to Pudong airport). If you enjoy some good exercise, it is an interesting five to ten minute walk to Century Blvd (Line 2 station), and then down to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jin Mao and World Financial Center buildings, or up to Century Park. There are plenty of taxis at the front door, something you should not take for granted in busy Shanghai.You are not on the Bund, but then again you are not harassed constantly by touts staked out at every tourist hotel. The Pudong area is modern Shanghai, as safe as can be. Upscale shopping is nearby as well as fashion market shopping at the Technology Museum subway stop.Contrary to another reviewer's comments, there are several nice Chinese &quot;white linen&quot; restaurants within a block. Heji is practically next door, not a storefront but on the 6th floor, and is crowded with locals eating copious amounts of great typical Shanghainese food. Whoops, back to the hotel review...The breakfasts were very good in quality. The hotel's lunch and dinner menus looked very affordable for such a high quality hotel. I will try the in-hotel restaurant next time. The hotel had the fastest internet I have seen in my 12 visits (and maybe 50 hotel stays) in China in the past three years. Lightning fast, just like my DSL at home. It costs 80 yuan, not a bargain but cheaper than some upscale hotels in Shanghai.Which brings me back to the overall quality of the Holiday Inn Pudong. The staff and accommodations will leave no doubt in your mind. You will wish every hotel, not just a Holiday Inn, could reach this outstanding quality. Apr 21 2021 	Shanghai City	the hotel is in the city centre and not very convenient from the business perspective. there are not many eateries around and hence not the likings for a tourist. Apr 17 2021 	Class Holiday Inn	Had been to Nanjing on business trip and had to visit shangai for the weekend. Stayed in the top floor and room offers all facilities. There are weekend prices and the main attraction of the hotel is the staff helpfullness. The hotel is located at Pudong and central to all the shopping places in Shangai. Taxis are very cheap if we stay at Holiday Inn Pudong and had recommended this place to my friends. Offer evening breakfast but then there is a hotel regis where resturants are situated in the ground floor and 38th floor. Food is good made of Olive Oil.Those who wish to visit Shangai should stay in holiday inn Pudong and ask fot the top floor rooms if available. The room is good enough for 2 people and if u need seperate bed you must tell them well in advance. The rooms are very clean and well maintained. Apr 4 2021 	affraid	I arrives yesterday to holiday inn pudong in dongfang road, very late because my flight was ca1950, maybe at 11 o'clock, I am platinium priority club member then they give to me the room in the executive floor, I was thirsty and I take one bottle of white wine, I didn't notice that the bottle was open before, then I drink it and was pipi, this is incredible, then when I go down to the reception for tell them about the problem, they said maybe I drink the bottle of wine and I don't want to pay, I write to u.s.a. for complain about this and I am still waiting an answer, this hotel is not recomendable, very high price, low quality service. Maybe this page will not accept in the fuorum my complaint but I will write it everywhere. Mar 29 2021 	Now a very nice hotel	I give this hotel a 5 star rating based on what you get for the price in Shanghai. I am in Shanghai several times each year and I find that this hotel is far better value than the other hotels at which I stay. The hotel has been completely renovated - many of the other reviewers had complaints about the noise during the renovations and I agree with them. I am fortunate that I stay there for business so I was always up before the noise started. The good news is that the construction is finished. The rooms are all newly renovated - The rooms compare to those in other Shanghai hotels which are several times the price. They are very clean, very well designed and everything works. Our group stays here regularly and we find that all of the rooms are now excellent. The restaurant service and food has improved immensely - along with a complete renovation of the restaurant, they also hired a Dutch manager and he seems to have been able to work a miracle in the main western restaurant. The Japanese restaurant on the second floor is still a bit dodgy, so my advice is to avoid that one. They have an Irish bar - Irish name but with a Filipino band - but there is draft guiness and pool tables and it is generally a fun and safe place for a late night drink. Back to why I gave this a five star rating - the staff are always very friendly and helpful and they speak good English. I book this hotel through Priority Club and there is never a problem on check-in and they are generous with upgrades. The hotel lobby and the rooms are always very clean, unlike some very expensive hotels in Shanghai. The hotel is rated as a four star hotel and my experience is that it is a good or better than most of the five star hotels in Shanghai, but at a fraction of the price. I would strongly reccomend this hotel to anybody who is staying in Pudong on business, since it is not in a tourist area. Mar 13 2021 	They finished remodeling...i think	I think this was my 3rd time at this hotel. When I was there this time, I didn't any jackhammers or saws. However, the hotel next door was under renovation (probably getting ready the world expo in 2010).The hotel's lobby and guest rooms looked more contemporary. I think they also added some more English TV channels as well. The internet speed was so-so. The hotel's restaurants aren't that good IMO. The breakfast buffet is good for Chinese standards, but would probably pass on it if an IHOP was nearby (there's a McDonalds within a 5 min walk). The Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor wasn't good. They served Japanese food that tasted like provincial Chinese food.Room service was still pretty prompt. I ordered spaghetti at 2am, and it took them about 25 minutes. Feb 24 2021 	Transformed into a first class experience	The renovations have just come to and end and the transformation is fabulous. While the rooms aren't sprawling the careful design gives plenty of room to work and rest. The feeling is now like a 5 star property and not the Holiday Inn that we used to know. With new restaurants, and new club lounge and a whole new feel. Flangans the &quot;Irish Pub&quot; is still there and still a welcome relief and a great meeting place. Staff are friendly and the level of english spoken makes the stay easy. Highly recommended and value for money. Oct 29 2008 	great hotel if wasn't under contruction	If you want to stay in the pudong area ( ie east of the river and most tourists should stay on the other side, west of the river, getting in between is a pain ) this is an excellent hotel in all aspects exept the 8am to 8pm construction noise, jack hammers all the time. everything else is perfect but you couldn't pay me to stay here again until the consruction is finished.the staff is excellent Oct 28 2008 	Hammerjack Inn	We stayed at this hotel for 8 days. From 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening, Saturday and Sunday included, it was a concert of renovation work tools. Impossible to rest in the day time even in the newly renovated room on the 32nd floor. Before booking check that renovation works are 100% over. Otherwise this hotel would be quite comfortable and as usual in Asia the personel is very helpful.Jean-René Bergé Aug 14 2008 	Holiday Inn Pudong great for Western travelers	I traveled to Shanghai alone on business and I knew that staying at a Western hotel chain would be essential. I arrived and had no trouble. The staff spoke english well and were quick to help me get around the city and make recommendations. The rooms and beds are large, which you don't get a lot in China. There was a plate of fresh fruit waiting for me in my room when I arrived. This is a nice touch after a 20 hour flight. Overall, a great place to stay! Mar 18 2007 	It's ok.	I stayed here for 3 nights just this week. The hotel is located in the Pudong area, where many new developments in Shanghai are located. We chose the hotel since it is one of the more reasonably priced ones in the Pudong area when our travel agent checked.However what we paid did not include the breakfast which is usually included in most of the hotels i have stayed in. We ended up having to pay approx. USD15-16 for the breakfast. The room size is quite good. There is enough space to move around despite having 2 twin beds and luggage. The bed is comfortable. The toilet is due for renovation. It's still usable but looks dated compared to the room that goes with it. They make up for this by giving a lot of free toiletries like shampoo, combs, etc.What bothered me was that the airconditioning was not working well when we checked into the room. To their credit, the hotel staff promptly came to check when we complained about this. However until the day we left it still was not working properly. I felt that it was a bit warm in the room. We should have asked to be transferred to another room. I guess this did not happen bec. we only were in the room in the evenings after dinner, and since it was quite cold in Shanghai during this time of year, we did not feel hot despite the aircon not working. For the 3 nights i did not use the comforter and just wore a shirt and boxers. The internet connection is not high speed for sure! I paid 80RMB for 24 hour access and the download speed was only around 10 kbps, sometimes up to 15 kbps. This is slow, our office has faster internet connection than that. Thus it's a bit overpriced for me. Feb 26 2007 	Ok not great !!	Stayed here for the secong time in a year. Booked through company policy so gave it a try again. The hotel itself is fine and has a good Irish Bar attached with some pleasant bar food available.Room was adequate but I had a very unpleasant smell which I couldn't locate the source. I will proabably not stay here again and will try other hotels in the area. Dec 29 2006 	Lovely staff	This is a lovely hotel with large rooms and excellent service. The staff have problem understanding English but are very hospitable. I was on the 18th Floor with a lovely view of the city. It is a little distance away from the Bund but you can get a taxi easily to the bund or back. Advise you to carry a card of the hotel in local language as incase you get lost this will be the only method you could come back as local population does not understand English easily. Nov 23 2021 	?????????? Sep 29 2021 	?????????????????? Sep 27 2008 	??"
"Nov 15 2021 	Beautiful hotel compound	This hotel is composed of several different buildings set back from the street in a compound with gardens and trees, so it's very quiet and pretty. Staff and service were excellent and cooperative. They were always ready to answer questions and provide sightseeing advice, though there was one person at the front desk who's English was not up to par. Room was very nice and had a small balcony. While not in the city center, a cheap taxi ride gets you there in 20 minutes or so. Considering the cost savings, it's well worth staying here. Jul 3 2021 	Overrated	I think all of the four and five star reviews here are a bit misplaced. This is a decent hotel but nothing special. My room was small and the bed was not that comfortable. The location is far away from the central business area and major tourist attractions and there is no metro within walking distance. The breakfast was OK but again, I've had better. If you want a bargain in Shanghai I recommend New World Mayfair. This place is not that expensive but not very good. Feb 15 2018 	Paradise in Shanghai	If you must go to Shanghai, then you must stay at this hotel. Oriental Luxury at an affordable price. I stayed seven days on a business trip and was blown away by the facility. The staff was excellent - very friendly, courteous, and helpful. The rooms were immaculate - I stayed in building two. The ammenities were superb. If you want a quiet, peaceful, gardenlike resort in the middle of a thriving metropolis to relax in, this is the place. There is no doubt about where I will be staying when I returm to Shanghai. Oct 20 2017 	Paradise in Shanghai	I’m not going to write about the convenience or amenities of the villas, you can look it up the hotel website I’ve provided. What I’m going to tell you is that of all the international 5 stars hotel I’ve stayed, this one really open up my horizon to luxury and peacefulness in the Shanghai city, and yet you’re only expect to pay the price of a cheap motel of Hongkong. Best feeling, walking down the small road inside the hotel, villas or resort (whatever you call it) and smell the heavenly flower sense, you can’t find it else where in the whole.Thumb up baby. May 30 2017 	A quite place to stay	Stayed here for the past three nights. The hotel itself is very nice, especially for the price relative to the big American or European chains downtown (i.e. Hilton, Marriott, etc.). The grounds have lots of trees and green. Room are in one of 7 buildings. I stayed in the main building - room 6122. It is about a 20-30 min. taxi ride to &quot;downtown&quot; but if you have business on this side of the city or are going to the domestic HongQiao Airport it can be convenient. A lot of Japanese live in the neighborhoods nearby so after walking about 10 min. you can find quite a few dining choices, especially for Japanese food. The hotel also has several restaurants on site. Room was of ample size and quite clean. High speed internet is available for a small charge. Service is generally good, but not true 5-star. Still I think this hotel represents a good value. Oct 19 2015 	Peacful Oasis	Very quiet business hotel about 30 mins from the centre of Shanghai. Set in its own gardens with a seperate health club pool it comprises of a few buildings centred around the main hotel. A lot of Chinese politicians use this hotel and I don't know if just any traveller can stay here because I came on business and our company has an office in the grounds. Very nice, very quiet but not the place to stay if you want to be in the thick of things! Sep 5 2021 	Stadsmanna mässigt"
"VERY GOOD VALUE	We stayed here 3 nights and we liked hotel with very clean and nice room good view and best service. Wife loved this massages here. She said they came with extras whatever that means. I decided not to ask for the sake of marital harmony. The price not expensive and good value Oct 3 2021 	Terrific value	I am from the US and visited Shanghai for about a week. The hotel is geared towards business travelers; the room layout reminded me of Hyatt's back in the states. Room amenities were top notch, as was service. The location was terrific as well. Overall, very good value. Jul 22 2021 	Hotel Carolina has everything you need for a comfortable stay	Hotel Carolina is on Xinhua Road in Shanghai, which is West of the downtown, Pudong area. Because it is not downtown is is very reasonably priced. I stayed there for a week with some class mates I was taking a course at the Economics school with. The school is about a 5 min. walk away, it was perfect. The metro station West Yan'an rd. is about 10 min. walk. The hotelwas impecably clean, the staff very freindly and the rooms are beautiful. There is AC and internet in every room. each room also has a bar fridge which is nice. The free breakfast is great. AS variety of Chinese food and toast, fruit, coffee, cereal area avail. There are computers with internet in the buiness centre. I can't say anough about how pleased I ws about this place. It is a great value and the service is excellent. Btw if you area a runner it is close to a great park for running called zhongshan park. Go early if you do. Zongshan has a loop trail that is popular with the locals. It isn't a really long loop, but it is much better than running on the sidewalk in full sun. Jun 14 2021 	Pleasant stay and would definitely come here again!	It was overall a great get-away from everything. It's located in the Chang Nan District of Shanghai... It is within a reasonable distance from most places (20 mins away by taxi). The room was clean and cozy and I loved the bathroom the most! The showers were a comfortable pressure... and they had two shower heads! One is fixed and acts as a rainshower, and the other one is a detachable shower head so that's pretty neat. The toilet was probably one of the better ones I've seen in China for awhile. I honestly didn't pay attention to the beds because for the 3 nights I've stayed here, I slept immediately since I had quite an exhausting travel schedule. There's a driveway and gate that leads you towards the hotel... The hotel is actually 30 meters away from the street so you can imagine how quiet it is. There was absolutely NO NOISE from the streets. There are two convenience stores at both ends of the streets. By the way, the hotel is located near the middle of the street, so no intersections to worry about either. Catching a cab was quite easy as well, as many vacant ones pass by the road quite frequently.The continental breakfast won't make you full but the food's decent, and gives you enough energy to survive until lunchtime. What else is there... Ah yes, places to suggest a foreigner should definitely visit. Of course, the Wai Tan area, and check out Cheng Huang Miao which is a great place to checkout some neat architecture and buy some local goodies, souvenirs, etc... For cheap bargains go to Qing Pu Lu - i bought some ridiculously cheap Giorgio Armani / Burberry London ties for 30 RMB... comes with matching cufflinks and pocket sleeves.. If I gave it to someone as a gift, the person would not even suspect that it would be a replica because it looks that real (maybe it is real?). Anyway, this hotel rocks and I definitely would return again! Oct 19 2021 	Plaisirs Simples"
"Nov 16 2021 	Enjoyed our stay at this great hotel	We stayed here for a couple of nights as part of a tour group. From our room on the tenth floor, we had a great view of the city. Included with our room was a buffet breakfast with both western and Chinese food. The place is conviently located and there is a large shopping mall within walking distance. We enjoyed lunch in one of its restaurants, E Cafe, which reminded us somewhat of Starbucks and had pastries and sandwiches along with excellent coffee and tea. Jun 6 2021	Enjoyable hotel but was subject to loud nightly construction noise	We stayed at the Equatorial Hotel from May 20-23, and were very aware of the loud construction noise outside of our hotel window. Regardless of what the General Manager said in the previous post, the whole front of the hotel was subject to this noise.We tolerated it for the beginning of our stay, but the noise during the last night was so loud that neither my husband or I was able to sleep. On the positive side, when we notified the front desk we were immediately transferred to another room on our floor that faced another direction and was quiet.Another issue about the hotel was the internet access. We did not have our own computer, so went to the Business Center to use their computers to access our email.They charge for 15 minute segments of time online, but the system was so slow that we didn't even get online for 20-25 minutes. We finally did get on, but the system was so slow that we ended up paying for an hour of time.We were staying at this hotel as part of a &quot;China Sampler&quot; trip on SmarTours. We really enjoyed Shanghai. This hotel had a very nice breakfast, with a large array of food choices for all types of tastes. They had the best eggroll that I ever tasted, as well as good dim sum and omelets for breakfast. The hotel is walking distance from Nanjing Road, which is an interesting and lively shopping street. We actually took a walk there and did some shopping (&quot;window only&quot; as the prices were very high.)We were amazed at the size of Shanghai and the millions of people and cars that were there. It was a very modern city with lots of interesting sights. May 10 2021 	Nice hotel pity about the roadworks	I spent one night at this hotel while in Shanghai for business. The hotel is well kept, elegant and comfortable. The rooms are not huge, but look fantastic and there is an acceptable number of English language channels on the TV.Unfortunately, even at my request for a quiet room, I was put in a room facing the main road which had road works operating from 8pm onwards (on a Sunday night). The windows did little to keep out the noise of jackhammers and construction vehicles and as a result I got very little sleep.The other main downside is the expensive internet acces which is unacceptable for a hotel with a business traveller slant.The hotel itself is quite a long way from the main entertainment/shopping district and &quot;the Bund&quot; - a taxi will be needed.If you can get a quiet room this would be quite an acceptable hotel to stay in. Apr 3 2021 	Doubt I Will Stay Again	There is nothing particularly wrong with Equatorial but I couldn’t wait to get out of there. No complaints about the room or the bathroom with small add-ons that matter, like toiletries, slippers, bathrobes, a tea pot, or a safe deposit box. There is a swimming-pool and a gym, both 6am-11pm. But this is where niceties end.The hotel staff has an aura of misery: no one is really helpful and forget smiles. Breakfast looks like a lot of variety but hardly anything tastes nice whether it is Western, Chinese, or sushi. Hotel has quite a few restaurants and bars but all are overpriced and lack the ambiance. Free WiFi is provided almost in all cafes on the premises but loud music makes it hard to work. Laundry service and in-house beautician are very pricy.I didn’t like the hotel at all. The building was ugly, breakfast tasteless, and what mattered most was the staff attitude. Will try to find something different for my next stay. Dec 16 2018 	central location in Shanghai	I stayed at the Equatorial for 1st 2weeks in December 2018. The hotel is immaculately clean and staff very helpful.I stayed on the 26th Floor and had access to the lounge - the extra 100RMB was worth it if you used it, complimentory tea/coffee all day, complimentory breakfast (normally 128 RMB) complimentory snacks 3.30 - 5.30 pm (very nice!) complimentory drinks + local beer 5.30 - 7.30 pm and free selection of daily papers. For the business users the lounge also offers broadband and pc access although WiFi is available (signal weak and tempremental on floor 26)the 'entertainment' in the cafe lounge consisted of a live singer accompanied by piano may be ok for some but not to my taste - i much preferred the live music on the top floor at the Hilton next door if i was to tell the truth, also being 12 floors higher the views are better as well.The 'golden question' is would i stay there again Honestly - i would if i had to as there is nothing wrong with the hotel but there is nothing that would make me make it first choice Nov 29 2018 	Good quality hotel	Good quality hotel that ticked all the boxes for a business hotel. Restaurants and bars were good services was excellent. Nov 13 2018 	Credit card malpractice	I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. But what transpired after has completely changed my opinion.On checkout, I paid by credit card. The hotel bills were in RMB, and the “TOTAL:” mentioned on the credit card bills were also in RMB. I expected to see the amount appear on my credit card bill in RMB, which my bank would then convert to Euro (my base currency) at that day's rate of 9.072284. Instead, when I received my credit card bill, I found to my horror that the hotel had billed me directly in Euros, at a *lower rate* of 8.889. And on top of that, my credit card company charged a foreign transaction charge, which is of course as per the T&amp;M. I contacted the hotel, and the manager wrote back saying that I paid in Euro. Ha! What a smart way to make extra money. If indeed the frontdesk person wanted to charge in Euro, she should have made that explicitly clear. She should have asked me before charging me in Euro. This malpractice on the part of a 5* hotel is very sad and ended up costing me a lot of money because of the conversion diff.So stay away from this hotel, or be careful about such credit card frauds. Nov 9 2018 	good hotel but not close to subway.	Large modern hotel. Efficient check-in. Most staff spoke English. Rooms were large and bathroom modern and clean. Complimentary terry robes, slippers, water, tea and coffee. Housekeeping staff very helpful. We ordered room service one night...pizza and salad. It was pretty good and service was quick.Location was not as central as we hoped..about 10 minutes away by cab to French Concession. On the last day we discovered some nice shopping areas within walking distance from the hotel. Not near any subway and was a long taxi ride to the Bund as the traffic was always terrible. Jul 5 2018 	Perfect location classy 4 star hotel	The Equatorial in Shanghai is part of the Malaysian chain and in a perfect location, just minutes via fly-over to the Jing'an Temple and West Nanjing Rd. You are minutes via cab to all the main attractions, such as East Nanjing Rd, People Sq and Huahai Rd. Rooms are well decorated, modern decor and with all the mod cons. We were upgraded to a club room, which are the same as the deluxe rooms, but on the highest floors. You wont get club lounge access if you get upgraded incidentally! Breakfast is great, as is the fitness centre, but hotel guests can only use the pool, you have to pay 150RMB p/p if you want to use the Jacuzzi. Jun 16 2018 	Great 4 star	This is a well located 4 star which is trying really hard to please. I was upgraded to the Equatorial Club floor this time (my second visit) and - while the separate check in and dedicated breakfast were nice - I wouldn't extra pay for this. Promised complimentary cocktails turned out to be a choice between orange juice and beer! The food in several locations I tried was all good and the staff universally attentive. Its not 5 star but then the prices aren't either. Trying really hard - a good effort under a British Gemeral Manager who seems to have his fingers on the pulse. Apr 5 2018	Perfect mix of Value location and great accomodations	Stayed in two rooms in the Equatorial in March, 2018 for 6 nights with my wife and two boys, ages 10 and 12. The price was pretty good. The view in our rooms was not bad. You could see a great distance but not much in the way of seeing any landmarks. The windows open which was nice to get fresh air. We thought the location was great. First we could walk to the French concession and we also took a long walk all the way to the Bund. There is an easy crosswalk over the highway that takes you right across the street to a gorgeous park. In that park is a stunning polonician resturaunt. Through the park is the entrance to the Metro.Each night I went merely around the block and found several local noodle shops, and other nice little resturants. The breakfast buffet was pretty good every morning with eastern and western foods.We used the pool and spa several times. Both were nicer than I even expected. The pool has a great view of the fascinating Shanghai traffic flow on the expressway. They are currently updating the spa but it was quite nice to begin with. There is a squash court and a tennis court. Finally, the workout facilities are excellent. We did so much great walking however that we didn't use it until our last day. Dec 22 2007 	Excellent hotel good location	I stayed here for a fair in Shanghai but did a little bit of sightseeing as well. The hotel is very nicely decorated, rooms have air conditioning, all toiletries (including toothbrush, razor) and complimentary drinking water delivered daily.The hotel is a short walk to the underground train which can take you into the main hub of Shanghai. There is plenty of shopping malls and restaurants close by too and if you are interested can purchase DVD's (in english) for around 5RMB each (around 80 cents) on the overpass outside the hotel. There are also toys, bags, jewellery etc depending on the time of day and weather.Buffet breakfast was good and had a good selelction of chinese/western foods. The desigh your own omelettes were great! There is a small gift shop in the hotel lobby (they had really cute panda toys in red silk vests for around $80RMB) there is also a tour desk and money-changing facility.As my boss and I were travelling with locals who work for our company, we got chauffered around the town and cannot remember the name of the place, but there is a huge indoor market with everything you can imagine. I picked up some awesome fake handbags for around $30AUD each which are the best copies i've ever seen. There is also clothes, jewellery, wigs, a lot of Mont Blanc pen sets (you shouldn't pay more than about 30RMB ($5AUD) for these as we picked them up 4 sets for 100RMB)All in all, a very comfortable hotel in a great location for shopping and the train. Dec 6 2007	Great Hotel at a Good Price	I recently stayed at the Equatorial Hotel in Shanghai after it was recommended to me. The hotel was great when we arrived the hotel was full on the normal hotel floors and because we have booked a Deluxe Room we were immediately accommodated on the Club Floor. The rooms have recently undergone a refurbishment and are very clean and tidy. On my second stay a week later we were accommodated on the normal hotel room floors and the room on those floor was very tidy and clean. The hotel reception were more than helpful. The breakfasts were great catering for all tastes. This hotel is very tailored towards business people and caters well for westerners. There are restaurants nearby behind the City Plaza Shopping Centre which are all very reasonably priced. There are restaurants in the hotel but they are a little more expensive. Better to experience the food outside the hotel. I would definately stay in this hotel again should I come back to Shanghai. Oct 9 2007	Shanghai comfort	Entering through the doors of this hotel let's you escape from the frantic activity this fantastic city thrives upon. It's very modern, like much of Shanghai now is. It's run very efficiently. The rooms are of a medium size, very clean and have three pin &quot;english&quot; type electric points. Mine didn't have much of a view. I guess I was on the wrong side of the building.The pool, and the upstairs bar are both quite quiet, and both look out at the constant throng of traffic going past. Though you can't hear any of it.The ground floor lounge bar is quite busy early evening, before people head out into the city to explore Shanghai by night.Would I stay here again? Yes.Would I recommend it to anyone else? Absolutely. Sep 12 2007 	Excellent 4 Star Hotel	I ahve stayed here twice, both for business. I found the hotel to be convenient, close to local shops and restuarants. Walking around the hotel, especially if you go left at the entrance and walk about 1km up the road you get into a residential area where you will find markets, street stalls and family restaurants. This is China, not the western style restuarants you see in central and elsewhere. Nearby there are also a number of up market pubs and western style restaurants....not easy to find.The rooms are spacious and well kept, inkeeping with a 4 star hotel in Asia. Its location is not the best but taxis are cheap. During peak periods go along the highway and pick up the taxi, there is normally a long quene at the hotel and the busboys are not very good at calling the taxis from the street( my only complain)Otherwise I recomend this hotel for most experienced traveller. if you need the pampering of the Four Seasons, don´t come here. Jun 27 2007 	Great Near-Top Tier Hotel at Good Value	The Equatorial is a great, next-to-top tier hotel, with terrific Western standard service, a great location, and all the features of the top-tier hotels. The heatlh spa and pool are terrific, rooms are of a decent size, and there is a large variety of restaurants.The hotel seems to attract many Asian clients, as Equatorial is a Malaysian chain, so you're not spending your time in Shanghai surrounded by westerners. If Western company is what you want, head for the Hilton next door.The location is close to the Metro, has a nice park across the street, and an easy walk to Hengshan Lu and its restaurants and bars. Jun 10 2007	China syndrome.	Stayed here night of 10th June. Breakfast: Ordered fried egg which never arrived despite talking to manager at the time. Coffee only poured when I drew attention to myself. Staff too busy yawning and talking amongst themselves. Must have been too early for them (6.45am) . No smiles! Then mentioned this to duty manager at reception who nodded wisely and carried on talking to Chinese friend. Plus side, food does taste good, rooms are clean and well serviced. Suggestion: free mineral (not distilled) water in small bottles for guests. Essentially this is a good hotel but staff still need supervision. Jun 4 2007 	My favourite hotel in Shanghai	I have stayed in several hotels in Shanghai and across China, and this is my all-time favourite. The rooms were immaculate, the staff seem genuinely friendly. A couple of them even remembered me by name from a previous stay - this personal touch made all the difference. The food is excellent, the breakfast buffet is by far the best and widest ranging buffet catering to all tastes. Even the coffee (a rarity in China) is good.On my last stay at the end of May 07, the hotel had a good offer on one of their executive suites. Again, I was most pleasantly surprised. A three room suite with all mod-cons, including little touches such as scales to weigh your luggage on, bedside alarm clock, desk lamp, etc. Previously I have stayed in their standard rooms however they are by no means any lower in standard and quality. Plus the recent refurbishment of the hotel has lifted its image further.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone who is considering staying in Shanghai. All the staff can speak at least conversational English, even the concierge and bell-hops.I am surprised this hotel hasn't been rated as 5-star, as it certainly merits it. I have stayed at 5-star hotels which are not nearly as good as this one.Keep up the good work Equatorial! Mar 18 2007 	good hotel	I stayed at this hotel while on a study abroad trip with a group from my university.This is a solid 4 star hotel, with all that entails. The only negative I can think of is that there are no real restaurants within walking distance. The location is not the best. I personally prefer to be in a center of sorts where I can walk to a restaurant and bar and stumble home after a long day.The lobby is nice and grand. Breakfast is good. The room is clean, nice and a decent size. Bathroom is fine with hansgrohe fixtures which I respect since I have them at home. The beds are very comfortable with fluffy down comforters. They are on the narrow side. Our room has 2 twin beds. The decor is asian contemporary. We have expansive floor to ceiling windows which afford us a fabulous view of the city. Room 1112 has a great view.The hotel has a spa which we will partake of later today. It is very reasonably priced. It also has a pool, small jacuzzi, steam and sauna. They give us free bottles of h2o daily. We have to pay for the internet in the hotel, although it was advertised to be free.happy travels Jan 17 2007	great find	we were walk inns of the street as we checked out of another hotel we got a great rate for executive room suite &lt;seperate lounge and bedroom with 2 toilets&gt; room was spacious and importantly clean. partner was sick for 2 days and the staff were fantastic in helping get medicines etc. looked at the hilton next door initially tiny rooms there. was a heftier price tag also so we felt this was a great find. comfortble soft bed also! Oct 26 2006 	Disappointing service	The food in the restaurant is very disappointing. The ingredients are not fresh, and there tends to be an aftertaste of crab even in dishes that don't have it, e.g., sliced fruit. The waiters drag their feet when they walk, and have a habit of taking things away from your table just when the spoon is making its way to your mouth. I find the atmosphere disruptive to proper dining.The customer service at the business center and the duty manager's station is very poor. I'm not sure how much of this can be attributed to the language barrier since they cannot communicate very well in English. I did not get assistance despite having asked for it. The commands in their programs (e.g., Microsoft Word) are in Chinese, so it was very difficult to get any work done.They change the bedsheets every day but once in a while we get one that has a shoeprint on it.Also, when I borrowed an ironing board, housekeeping gave me one that was missing a leg. Jul 14 2006	Decent hotel noisy renovation work	Decent hotel, mainly aimed at business people. Excellent staff who speak good English. Just a little further away from some sights such as The Bund, Nanking Street than other hotels but that yields benefits of easier access to other areas and gives those who chose to walk downtown more of an experience. Easy and cheap to get taxis....even all the way out to Pudong was rarely much more than 50 RMB (but make sure you get a state owned taxi using a meter)Excellent reception and front door staff, very efficient room cleaners. Room was immaculate in all respects and well up to usual &quot;International&quot; business class. Choice of restaurants and decent buffet, lounges and residents facilities on 4th floor including bar with live music each night...except Monday!Only problem during my stay, was the renovation work which I was unaware of when booked. Substantial (it must be judging by the noise) renovation work on 16th and above floors. I was only on 14th floor but from 9.00AM until 7.00PM constant hammer drilling and banging, literally non-stop, every day. It sounded so loud I thought it was coming from the room next door. Also, it was not exceptionally hot outside but for some reason I just could not get the AC to bring the room down to a decent sleeping temperature. I asked the front desk to investigate it and went out, assuming they had checked it but there was no improvement.Would I stay there again.? Probably Yes, as the price was good too but I would check on the renovation work first. Apr 11 2006	Nice hotel	This hotel mainly caters for business people but it is a nice enough hotel and not too expensive. It doesn't have the best views of the city, but it is in a nice part of town, within walking distance of all the designer malls and close to a metro stop and a temple and near some good bars. The staff all speak good English, the rooms were clean and a good size, there is a pool and breakfast runs quite late and is a decent buffet (consists of Chinese dumplings, eggs any way you like, fruit, yogurts, cereals, croissants, bacon...). We enjoyed our stay here and found it easy to get around the city from this hotel. Mar 2 2006	Buyer Beware	Shanghai: Hotel Equatorial Hotel-Shanghai: &quot;Buyer Beware&quot;Date: March, 2nd, 2006Reviewer: Jenny, Seattle, USAMy sister-in-law who lives in Shanghai booked this hotel one month ahead of my arrival date through a local agency called Elong. She called to confirm for me a day before. When I got to the airport and realized my flight will be delayed for two hours. I called her again from airport. She phoned Elong and was told that room will be held for us until 6:00am next day. All the check-in information was also on paper faxed by Elong. When my boyfriend and I got to the hotel to check in around midnight, the receptionist looked at the paper and said this reservation has been cancelled since we showed up late and didn't call and the bad news was that they sold out for that night. I demanded to talk to the manager and he basically repeated same thing as receptionist told us. After a long day flight at 1:00am in Shanghai, we didn't have our room. Fortunately I have family in Shanghai. My dad phoned Peace Hotel and we got one room there around 2:00am. Believe or not,that date was my boyfriend's 40th birthday.We planned that way to be more exciting. Instead we were exhausting. But but but this is not end of the story. My sister-in-law was so furious that she called Elong next day. She was more furious when she was told by Elong that we never went to hotel to check in. The hotel lied to Elong. That means Elong will still charge one night from her credit card. At that point my boyfriend and I decided to go the hotel again to confront the manager. We didn't only after we found out Elong decided not to charge one night on my sister-in-law's account. Later on we found out Shanghai had been so popular that many 4 or 5 stars hotels in good location were not easy to book. Most of them were overbooked. We were told in JW Marriot that they were overbooked by 20 rooms when we checked in the day after. My advice to anybody who travel there is to call the hotel yourself on the arrival date and tell them your arrival time even you book the hotel through Hotel or Expedia or any other web site. Sep 27 2005 	Comfortable well-appointed 	I unfortunately have no comparison to other hotels in Shanghai, but upon approach of the Hotel Equatorial you can feel that you're walking into comfort. The lobby is beautiful with its high 2-story ceiling, marble floors, &amp; accented lighting. Service is friendly &amp; efficient. There seemed to be a lot of foreign tourists &amp; business travelers so I assume the staff is well-spoken in English. All in all the staff was at all times helpful, efficient, &amp; professional. The rooms are sized fairly well, but the bathrooms weren't much to boast about. The linens, at least, were crisp. There are a number of restaurants &amp; lounges inside the hotel to relax. There are a few gift shops to browse and they offer currency exchange, a business center, etc. All things that make a good hotel worth the stay.The breakfast at the Equatorial is renowned &amp; well worth its own paragraph description. The seating in the breakfast area is spacious &amp; open with coffee table-service. All the food is served buffet style -- and what a buffet it is. Both Western &amp; Asian style cuisine is offered...in fact more Western choices than Asian. The selection includes a congee bar, omelette table (made to order in front of you), fresh fruits, baked goods, yogurts, cold cuts, eggs/bacon/sausage, etc. It was immense &amp; wonderful. The atmosphere of the whole place at the Hotel Equatorial is modern-grand &amp; tasteful -- a miniature embodiment of everything Shanghai is today as an international modern metropolis. Sep 24 2005	Good mid range hotel easy access location	Hotel is large, over 20 storeys high and is located on the western end of the Yan'an Road. Rooms are large, standard for a good business type hotel. Bathroom spotlessly clean, however slightly dated. Lobby bar needs redecorating but staff are pleasant. Large buffet style breakfast, same restaurant also does buffet lunch and dinner. Chinese and Steakhouse restaurants also in hotel. Taxi to the Bund or to Nanjing Road around Eur2-3. Hotel is just north of French Connession area, great location for bars, restaurants and shopping. Good mid range hotel, good deals available, location good for access to city centre. Recommended. Jul 20 2005 	Excellent Hotel	I have stayed in this hotel twice. It is first class with excellent food. The choice for breakfast is wonderful and if you try only a quarter of the options you will hardly need to eat another thing for the rest of the day. Apr 20 2005	Very Comfortable	Friendly but efficient staff. Beds, bedlinen and pillows were the most comfortable I have ever had in a hotel. Breakfast excellent, catering for Western and Asian tastes with a chef on hand to cook lovely eggs and omelettes with ingredients of your choice. Huge swimming pool and good facilities. Hotel a little away from the Bund, but taxis to anywhere of note only cost about 20 yuan, (about 1 pound sterling), so not a problem. Apart from well stocked little shops, they also had an all day bakery where you could buy yummy cakes etc, such a good idea when you only need a snack on the run and not room service. Side rooms at the hotel from my nineteenth room floor gave a view of the Pearl Tower. Rates are also reasonable for this standard of hotel.

"Nov 11 2021 	You get what you pay for	This hotel is your standard Ibis hotel located in Pudong. A good 20 minute walk away from the nearest metro station, but it does have two shopping areas next door with good restaurants, Starbucks, Carrefour supermarket etc. It is a long way from the tourist attractions however.Usual Ibis room with tiny bathroom (shower, toilet, basin) and room with bed and desk up against the window. Small flat screen TV with only a couple of English channels (ESPN, Bloomberg and CCTV English channel).Despite other reviews saying the beds are hard, I can say it is not as hard as the bed I've had to sleep on since moving to China! In fact it felt positively soft! However, it is probably much harder than most westerners are used to. I felt a better job could have been done with the cleaning. The shower hadn't been cleaned properly (mould in corners, along edges and around the plug hole) and it got progressively worse over the days we stayed. There was a lot of noise overnight (we were on the 11th floor) that woke me up several times each night - people shouting, car alarms constantly going off and fireworks. The people staying in the room above us were up most of the night as well and I could hear them walking around.The staff were not overly friendly or helpful. There was free internet available in rooms, but in the evening it slowed to almost dial up speed.If you can put up with the noise, distance from everything and things being a bit rough around the edges then this is a cheap hotel in an expensive city. However next time, I think I'd pay more for something in a better location and for a better experience. Sep 20 2021 	Excellent IBIS standard as usual	We checked-in at this hotel after one night at White Mansion Hotel (Bai Sha Hotel) and we were not dissapointed with our change of hotel. The room and service were great as usual on IBIS hotels and we enjoyed our stay here. Especially, we appriciated the service level by the staff who spoke English and always were very helpful. But we also liked the district of the hotel , the cleaniness and the breakfast. The hotel is a good choice in Shanghai. Aug 4 2021 	OK except lacking in room amenities	1) Cleaniness: room was clean, no complaints.2) Location: located just opposite Thumbs Plaza in Pudong, which is convenient as there is plenty of restaurants and a Carrefour just across the street. It is a little walk to the nearest metro station, but getting a cab is convenient. Thus, location is not bad if you are active mostly on the Pudong side, as cab fares for a few trips to Puxi side can easily make up for the low price of this hotel. 3) Room: the room is small and basic. There is no fridge, no safe, no hairdryer, no iron and ironing board, no tissue, paper cups were provided instead of the usual glass cups, and u have to bring ur own shower gel and shampoo. We did ask for a hairdryer from the reception but were informed for both days we were there that they have all been loaned out. Bed as hard as rock. 4) Service: slightly better than typical chinese hospitality.5) Value: if you can make do with what is lacking and a really hard bed, then it is an acceptable price to pay for an international brand name and clean basic rooms. Apr 26 2021	A clean budget check-in check-out hotel	Stayed here for 2 nights due to emergency repairs at my apartment. This hotel was a typical ibis hotel (similar to those in France near the highways). It was surely a budget hotel and had nothing to be savoured by the means of hotel facilities (a check-in, finish what needs to be done in Shanghai and check-out). The bed was clean and comfy but the &quot;sofa/bench&quot; was HEAVILY stained so I kept well away from that. The bathroom was a signature ibis prefabricated module type, had a Grohe shower head and sufficient water pressure. I asked for a non-smoking room, but the front desk replied that they don't specifically differentiate between non-smoking/smoking rooms. Fortunately I stayed in a room that didn't reek of smoke. There was free internet and free parking too.There are great shops and restaurants near by. It’s also very close to the international exhibition centre. I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you're on a shoe string budget or quick business trip. Nov 13 2018 	Very good value clean comfortable	This is a new hotel with the latest Ibis rooms to the standard french design. Small modular bathroom with good big shower. Queen size bed, faux timber flooring, desk against window and small couch and wardrobe. (See photo on hotel website). Free broadband internet with ethernet cable in room. Some international TV stations, inc HBO, Bloomberg and French TV, but curiously not BBC or CNN. The Ibis is located some distance out in Pudong, not far from the Maglev station to Pudong airport. Metro station about 1.5km away (take a taxi), but the outdoor mall- Thumb Plaza is opposite. It has a Carrefour hypermarket and big range of restaurants, bars and cafes as well as Bank of China. Good asian breakfast with limited western choice, but you can get toast, croissants, fruit and coffee for 20RMB. A pleasant bar as well. Good management and friendly desk staff. If price is a consideration and you want a comfortable, very clean international standard hotel with free internet and international TV, then this is the hotel for you in Shanghai. Nov 12 2018 	Ok only. But I don't think I'll stay there again.	1. Getting there: Good thing we printed out the name and address of the hotel in Chinese because Shanghai is enormous and the taxi driver would never be able to find this place without the address. Even with the address a few taxi drivers drove right past. We had to point out the &quot;ibis&quot; sign. But the hotel is like, off the main road, down a driveway. So it's not easy to find.2. Checking in: HAHA they don't speak English. The whole time we were there, only one manager spoke and understood English well enough for us to have a coherant conversation. That said, between hubby and I, we do speak a little halting Mandarin and I could definitely say that it was still better than the staff's English.So the check-in was a bit slow. And they gave us a smoking room though we did request non-smoking when we made our reservation. Their response was that the hotel is new so the cigarette smell wouldn't be noticeable. WRONG!! But because it was so hard to communicate, we just bared with it. But NEVER AGAIN.The bellboy showed us to our room. And *shock horro* it was occupied. So he left us in the corridor to find a new room.3. Amenities and facilities: Bathroom amenities were just the toothbrush, unknown brand toothpaste, and some soap and shampoo. Bring or buy your own stuff. Their stuff is probably like the cheapest you can find anywhere. They have free internet downstairs BUT haha I couldn't work out how to work the computer. The typing all came out as Chinese writing!!!Oh yeah, the free broadband in the room for your computer was good. I think that's why I chose this hotel, coz of the free internet. Others were charging ridiculous amounts for broadband.4. Restaurant: The breakfast was RMB20 per person which is super cheap but expect to get what you pay for. Being very unadventurous as far as food goes, I didn't try most of the things there and there really wasn't very much there for you to choose from either. Porridge, fruit, salad, some dumplings (that didn't taste nice) and oily, salty fried noodles. Juice. I only ate there once. It was enough..5. Location. Ok location. There's a big shopping centre across the road. Carrefour. Many restaurants, though I would say the restaurants are kind of expensive there. But to get to the attractions and into town, it was a bit of a hassle. No train within walking distance, we'd take a taxi to the nearest train station. The taxi was about RMB20. Not too expensive. Just a hassle.Taxi to town was about RMB40. Taxi back from town was RMB65. More expensive coz the taxi would have to make a huge round. Take the train to the science centre stop and take a taxi from the taxi stand there.6. The room: Small, with lots of corners that you can stub your toes on. Didn't like the smoking room smell. But I suppose that's subjective, right? Tiny little bathroom cubicle, which I assume is standard with Ibis hotels. The shower leaked a lot of water into the bathroom and so the bathroom floor was freezing cold all night.Overall ok for the price. I paid RMB245 per night. Very cheap for a room in Shanghai. But next time I think I'll stay at Novotel Atlantis or Sofitel Hyland. I ate at both hotels and prefered the locations. Didn't like having to take taxi everywhere.

"Worth staying and check out the Harvest Moon restaurant	Initially we were not sure when we booked this hotel and our fears were not helped by the lack of correct inforamtion provided by the hotel on subway lines and how to find them.This was further complicated during our stay as the hotel staff were friendly but seemed to not have much useful local knowledge or the information was wrong. Usually they just recommended taking a taxi thereby passing the problem on to someone else!The rooms in the hotel are large, but the walls are thin so you can often hear your neighbours.We stayed at the hotel twice as we did a brief visit to Xi'an and the hotel allowed us to store our luggage for free which meant we only had to take what we needed for a short trip - which was excellent.On our return they upgraded us to a larger room with a tub. Next to the hotel is a restaurant called the Harvest Moon that is worth checking out.The bar of the hotel also allows you to buy a voucher and then it is all inclusive drinks in the bar - it is well worth it.Breakfast at the hotel is plentiful with lots of choice. Sep 7 2021 	optimal business hotel	Location, setup, facilities, prices, all make for a perfect place to do business. great value and excellent food.Each time, we have stayed for a few days and run a number of client seminars in the conference rooms.Staff are great - right out of 4-seasons training, access to local life (even if it; just a walk &amp; ferry to Pudong is adjacent), and the metro is just 4 minutes walk so one doesn't have to use the very variable Shanghai taxis. Aug 24 2021	Nice and good hotel	the location is very good, only 100 meters away from the Shanghai Yu garden. Clean and comfortable. The food at the lobby restaurant is specialized in seafood, fresh and delicious! Aug 11 2021 	great hotel	What a fantastic hotel,in all aspects.Great location Wonderful staff who go out of there way to help you ,excellent restaurant,why would you want to stay anywhere else. Mar 25 2021 	Very pleased as usual!!	This is our second two week long stay at this hotel in Shanghai. We are extremely pleased with the exceptional service and wonderful breakfast, and super accomodating staff. Across the street from the Old City, very convienient and very close by taxi to Bund and other attractions. We will be staying there again very soon. Apr 7 2018	Don't bother	I stayed at Yun's Paradise last weekend with 3 other friends. The hotel is below average in almost every aspect: Location: whilst the hotel is located near the Bund and XinTianDi, (only 5-10 mins away by taxi), it is also located at the intersection of a highway. Cars coming only from ONE direction can make a stop at the hotel. During our stay, we took about 4 taxi rides back to the hotel, and every time we had to stop somewhere near the hotel and walked back. There is no subway station near the hotel. Room: the bed is quite comfortable, and the room is of a decent size. However the room is VERY dim due to inadequate lighting. Service: the front desk is hands down the worst that I've ever encountered in my whole adult life. On two occasions I asked them for directions to two famous restaurants in Shanghai. Not only did they not know anything about the restaurants, they also refused to call the restaurants up for me (i had the number), telling me instead to make the call myself. Business Center: when we walked into the business center one night to use the internet, we found two staff member slouching against the wall smoking cigarettes. No wonder the room smelled so bad. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody. Mar 12 2018 	Not Paradise but a nice place still...	We decided to try this hotel as the price and location seemed good. In fact, all rooms were freshly renovated and the decoration looked &quot;retro&quot; but gadgets were modern (sensor light switches, LCD flat screen mounted on wall, etc...). Broadband internet was free as in most 3 star hotels across China. The bathroom was not roomy in our piece and we had to use the top of the toilet tank for personal toiletries. We could not ascertain if other room types were better. The location is a little far (by foot) to city center. There was a lot of construction going nearby. If you learn how to move in city buses, it is cheap &amp; convenient: for ¥2 you can reach Nanjing Street, People's Square, The Bund, and once you reach a metro station you are solved! The closest attraction was Yu''s Garden at 5 minute walking range. Service was &quot;not exceptional&quot; and smiles were not free. There is room for improvement but &quot;overall&quot; it was above standard for a hotel in a big city like Shanghai.

"Apr 2 2018	Unscrupulous Management!	BEWARE WHEN BOOKING DIRECT WITH HOTEL!!! MANAGEMENT IS UNSCRUPULOUS! DO NOT DIVULGE YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS TO THEM! We had to turn back from Llhasa due to the riots and found ourselves in Shanghai. We called Old House Inn on the day we arrived (Friday) to check if they had any last minute rooms available for Friday to Sunday. After being informed that the hotel was fully booked for Friday, the receptionist Nicky said she would get back on availability for Sat and Sun as somebody may be cancelling his booking. We then made arrangements to stay with a friend when she called back (Friday evening) and said they had a room available for both nights but that we would have to change rooms. I made the mistake of giving the hotel my credit card details as a guarantee, thinking that it was a reputable place from all the reviews I read on the internet. On Saturday morning, however, we thought that we might as well stay put at our friend’s place and called to check if we could cancel our reservation. We were told that it was not a problem and that I would not be charged for it. On Monday afternoon, however, as we were waiting for our flight back to Singapore, I received a call from the hotel, “a courtesy call to inform you that we will be charging you a full night’s rate for your cancellation”. That was certainly all the courtesy I received from them, having had the phone slammed down on me when I tried to explain that I was told earlier that there would be no cancellation fee. Upon reaching home, I called my credit card company to check if there was a charge made by Old House Inn, or a hotel in Shanghai, on or after Mar24. No, I was informed and told not to worry since I did not give the hotel the security number on my credit card. When I received my credit card bill, needless to say, I was shocked to find a charge of RMB1030 on Mar24 to, not the Old House Inn, but to Laoshiguang Restaurant! My credit card company now says that the money has been paid to them and it is up to the hotel whether they want to give me a refund, especially since everything was done over the phone. The hotel apparently has phone records, which they quote in support of their argument, but when I asked them to check on the second call I made they seem to have no record or memory of it. It is one thing to be charged a cancellation fee, and another to be told that there would be no charge and to later be charged the full room rate for “no show” and to be told by the hotel manager I have no choice about the matter! Jan 6 2018	Lovely and peaceful hotel and neighbourhood	A very private, calm and peaceful house with excellent exterior and interior design. The service is personal, helpful and warm. Two minutes walk across Chashu Road, there are lovely restaurants and bars. Walking inside the small streets away from the main road near the restaurants will lead you to some very interesting residential house built around 1920. Ten minutes walk to Jing An Park and Temple, best visited in the earlymorning around 7:30 a.m. Walking around Jing An Temple will let you see many nice building of 1920's - one of the best experience for my visit in Shanghai. Jul 8 2017 	Great Litlle Boutique Hotel	We wanted an alternative to the megachain hotels, and our first choice (Hotel No. 9) was booked,so our agent found this. We loved the antiques, the charm, etc. We had a large room on the second floor with a King size bed - and yes, the traditional cement mattress. I guess you'd have to stay at the Sheraton for a softer one....We had adequate air conditioning, the bathroom was big and clean, and we liked the breakfasts, tho we also sometimes ordered a ala carte for something heartier. Didn't eat at the restaurant since there's so much available in Shanghai, but it was pleasant.The staff were very friendly, there's a computer near the front desk for free internet, and we could walk to the french quarter. All in all,a good alternative to staying at a hotel where you could be in any city in the world.....this is definitely a Shanghai experience. Mar 13 2017 	Hip in old-skool style	Had a great stay at this hotel. The rooms were big and had great interior design. The service was also excellent and the staff was very friendly and accomodating.The hotel restaurant was also very interesting. It was very modern and hip, a stark contrast from the supposed-Chinese-inn atmosphere of the hotel. Food was delicious, although the free breakfast got boring on the 3rd day. Same menu every day. Location was great too. It is right by many little shops, bakeries, and the train station. Taxis are easily accessible too. One thing to note. If you are expecting a totally Chinese traditional inn experience, you might be a little disappointed. Don't expect too much. Dec 27 2016 	Great Boutique Hotel	Quickly:- Boutique hotel- GREAT restaurant attached- Spotless very sparely, but chic-ly decorated rooms- 12 minute taxi ride to The Bund- Staff driver who will pick you up and organize day tripsIt's called the Old House Inn because it's in a very cool OLD HOUSE. If you're looking for a non-corporate and more charming place to stay in Shanghai, stay here. I think they have about 20ish rooms all of which are spotless with chocolate wooden floors, antique furniture and good [firm] beds. Over the course of ten days, I stayed in two different rooms. Room 201 is large, has a very comfortable queen bed and a few tables. It also has two french door windows that open to a balcony that overlooks the [very tasty] restaurant attached to the property - A Future Perfect [where you eat your basic breakfast]. This restaurant has a great covered patio and serves excellent martinis. I eventually moved to the 3rd floor to a very cozy room with a slanted ceiling which I nicknamed the Anne Frank room. I was alone and so it seriously didn't matter. I loved this place. It was very easy to stay in and the staff wrote all my destinations down before hopping into a taxi. There is no common room or computer for guests [although I believe the rooms have wireless access]. You can hang in the restaurant/bar if you need some social interaction. Sep 5 2016 	Great location shame about the breakfast	This hotel was highly recommended as a gem in Shanghai, and while I can't quite agree that it's what Shanghai needs more of, it is a unique experience. I was travelling on business and stayed for 5 nights.I arranged a pick-up service from Pudong airport, but they weren't waiting for me when I arrived. I phoned the hotel to tell them, but their English isn't great, so I wasn't entirely convinced they would sort it. The driver arrived about 15 minutes later.The hotel is located just down off the main road, and initially I was put off by the location as it looks a bit dirty, but that's nothing to worry about. Reception could do with sprucing up, but otherwise is fine. I was initially in room 303 on the top floor, which has a sloping ceiling, so I didn't get a full four-poster bed as seen on their website. It had a nice bath-tub, but with the sloping ceiling, it wasn't the best shower in the world. I changed rooms to the one next door no problem and had the nice four-poster and a shower cubicle I could stand up in! There is a really fast and FREE internet connection in the rooms - just don't forget your laptop. Beds are surprisingly comfortable despite being very firm by British standards.The restaurant is where you have breakfast, and they have a bizarre system where you have to get a card from reception to give to the waiting staff. Breakfast consists of four thick slices of white toast, boiled egg, coffee or tea and orange juice. It's a O way to start the day, but not very traditional. You can buy other options, and I thoroughly recommend their museli - it comes with lashings of fesh fruit and yoghurt and costs a reasonable price.The staff at the reception desk are extremely helpful and very personable. They understand more than they speak, and will write down addresses in Chinese characters for you.Overall, it is a good stay in this hotel if you're looking for something other than the usual corporate hotel experience. Jul 10 2016	Good location - so-so accomodation	Located in the middle of the French Concession, the Old House is in a good location that ins't in the center of the city hustle and bustle. The rooms were nice and clean, but small, with typical Chinese mattresses (i.e. extremely firm). The hotel, unfortunately, is adjacent to a restaraunt, which can be quite loud. It seems like our room was immediately over the kitchen, which was noisy - especially as it started up early in the morning to serve breakfast. We also conjectured that the kitchen used all of the hot water, as we were only able to achieve one semi-warm shower per day. The rest were cold showers. It was a shame that the noise and water were such detractors, because otherwise I would have enjoyed the stay. Apr 29 2016	Fashionable	My young cousin who lives in Shanghai booked this for my son and me, so it was certain to be trendy. The room was a little small, and we had to share the bed. But it was clean and the bathroom was reasonable, and the water hot but of variable pressure. I did use the heater a little even in April. The staff were friendly if imperfectly anglophonic, and they dealt well with a laundry emergency. The included breakfast is western, which is a shame really, but my son liked it. There is nothing of great interest right nearby, but JingAn station is not a far walk. The map on their businesscard is so stylised that some taxi drivers have trouble finding the place. It was pricier than places we stayed in other cities, but this could be a Shanghai phenomenon. Feb 16 2016	Shanghai Surprise!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the OHI for 4 nights and it was a true gem of a hotel. We booked a standard double, but had to stay in one of the larger &quot;suites&quot; on the top floor for the first night b/c they were booked. While the room was larger (king bed and tub v. double and shower stall), it wasn't worth the extra $$. The room we were transferred to was not only much more intimate and smaller, the bathroom was just as nice and we LOVED it. We actually preferred the smaller room as it was cozier and we had none of the noise/ventilation issues that former reviewers had.There was an issue w/ the heating/AC unit b/c the remote was in Chinese, but the front desk was VERY helpful during our entire stay. It is true: be prepared for very limited English-speaking staff at night, but during the day, the staff was super friendly. While we never made it to the breakfast, the restaurant staff was also helpful whenever we popped in to buy water, etc. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel as a preferred alternative to the Hyatts and other mainstream big hotels b/c it is a true gem! We would go back in a heartbeat! Jan 5 2016	Old House Inn -- disagree with previous review	Appreciate the comments of the previous reviewer, but my experience of the Old House is that it is a gem of a hotel. The rooms are minimally furnished but with four poster beds and traditional (or at least traditional style) furniture it makes for a unique experience away from some of the bland chain hotels. The staff are friendly and helpful and it is well located in the French Concession.I wholeheartedly recommend a stay there. Dec 29 2005 	Clean but not for lone travellers	Stayed twice on the 14th (Double room 680RMB)and 17th (Single room 490RMB)Both rooms clean and tidy but small compared to other hotels. Heaters are not adequte for shanghai in winter as windows have shutters and fold back windows. (lot of gaps)Television offers no European or US channels only English lang CCTV9. The resturant has been sold to 3rd party Bar in resturant. Did not eat in resturant as menu looked european/US.Breakfast included in price Tea/Coffe 2 slices of toast 1 boiled egg. No choice offered.Staff friendly and speak fairly good englisg and i belive German, will write your desination in chinese if required.5 Minutes walk from Jinghu Temple metro2 Minutes Hilton HotelOverall if travelling as part of a group it will give you a feel of a small family run hotel with your own private apartments.As a single traveller a very lonely Hotel."
"Jun 7 2021 	Good Location Small Suites But Comfortable	The Hotel Location is perfect, close to the downtown. The Suites are pretty comfortable with one Living room, a Kitchenette &amp; a bedroom. If you want to cook something then its a good place. The rooms on higher floor gives good view &amp; people seem to know this place very well. Feb 11 2021 	Very nice clean suite	If it's not for the subpar location, this hotel would have been a great pick. Located at a quiet residential area of Shanghai, this hidden gem has one of the biggest hotel rooms I have ever seen and I have been to quite a few places (see my profile) !As the hotel name has suggested, all hotel rooms are suites with really nice living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. I had the best sleep ever on my business trips here. The only knock was its location. Some of the local taxi drivers did not know this place at all so be sure to carry a local map or the hotel's business card with you just in case. There's no decent restaurant within walking distance other than a Shanghaiese restaurant to the left of the hotel next to a motel. No convenience store could be spotted nearby as well. Nov 5 2018 	Excellent	I was there for 3 weeks. This HOJO is nothing like the North American HOJO, this one is so so much better! I've travelled quite a bit and I can tell you that the rooms are as good as it shows on their website. There are lots of hotels which tries to show how pretty the room is but when you're actually there, the quality of the room is nothing as it looked on their website, but for HOJO, you won't believe it but its better than what it shows on their site. Believe it! Beautiful suite with a nice kitchen &amp; sink but you'll have to buy your own pots &amp; pans :) which is no biggie..The bed is king size...good mattress, pillows...everything was excellent..there is nothing I would complain about this place and trust me, I am very picky person, so if I say its good...its REALLY GOOD!! You'll thank me for this recommendation. Another good thing about this place is because I stayed from 3 weeks, the sales person, his name is Frank and he offered me a washing machine in my room. The moment I checked in, they brought the washing machine in and set it up in the balcony. This was very convenient for me because as I said, I'm picky person and I would prefer to do my own laundry. He also gave me free access to internet. The staff are extrememly friendly and the cleaner cleans the room every single day and by the time I'm off work, the room is nice and fresh! The bathroom is equiped with almost any need..and they replace every single day! The only only thing that I should say is missing is a swimming pool, that would have been great had there been one..but its no biggie for me because Shanghai is such a beautiful city and I'd rather go out and visit places. Convenience wise, its ok...doable...I should say...taxi is available anytime ...of course...anywhere else...during rush hours its always longer...but otherwise its great! Staff downstairs are very friendly and helpful. There is a travel agency downstair and the guy working there is also Frank. Very helpful at all times and took real good care of me and help me organise my weekend trips to Hangzou etc. Finally...its a really nice hotel ...and worth the money...and honestly...it made my stay very more comfortable! Would definitely stay again if I'm back in Shanghai! Jun 16 2018 	Great rooms with friendly staff	For approx A$120 per night we had a magnificent apartment with King size bed. The quality of the fixtures and fittings were top class. The facilities were excellent with separate TV's in lounge and bedroom, and fully equipped kitchen.Prices and food quality were also very good in the Monet Restaurant - but, there were only a few tables occupied on the Saturday evening we were there.The staff were efficient and very friendly - broken English, but passable.Yes, there is a downside and that is distance from centre of town. However, a taxi to The Bund will only cost you A$4, so is that really an issue?We would stay there again, and thoroughly recommend it. Mar 2 2018	Like your own private apartment	Was booked at this hotel by my local business contact. I have to admit I was not feeling good about being in a Howard Johnsons, but this hotel is a former luxury apartment building. Each room is a lavish suite with kitchen, bath, separate bedroom, living room, and office nook. Beautifully appointed. Nice big walk-in shower. Fancy bathroom sink. Highly recommended. Jan 15 2018	A recommended hotel	The hotel has an excellent location. Just a few minutes walk from Nanjing Road and the subway stations. It does not take you long to walk to the Bund as well.( Last time I went to Shanghai i stayed at Westin. Of course the services provided by Westin provided was of higher quality, but the cost was much much higher too.)We had 2 rooms and both were clean and comfortable. The serivce was quite good as well. We booked the hotel through a travel agent. The price was reasonable compared to the services provided. I will recommend my friends to stay there if they go to Shanghai. Aug 15 2017 	Best Hotel in Shanghai	Howard Johnson All Suites Shanghai is the place to stay! I am a frequent traveller where I travel from Hong Kong to Shanghai every week, arrive on every Friday and depart on Sunday. Somtimes I stay for 3 nights depending on the situation. The hotel itself has a nice lobby, although the staff members sometimes are not too quite friendly but it is manageable. The room itself is very large and clean! No complains there. Comfy beds and for the price for around 500 - 600 rmb, you get a suite with the necessary amenities, coffee maker, mini bar, refrigerator, bottled water, washroom amenities. Transportation is very convienient versus the 5 stars hotel like the le meridien etc.. As the hotel is located in a more suburb area, taxi quantities seems to be more around that area! Jul 16 2017 	Good Hotel	The Howard Johnson offers you more than only a hotelroom; large suites with own kitchen and seperate living and bedroom.The Howard is small compared to other big Shanghai Hotels. The rooms are very well equipt, chairs, a large sofa, flatscreen television and large workdesk. The bed is large and sleeps ok. The rooms is decorated very nice with good paintings and colours on the walls.The bathroom is ok, large but simple equipt.The staff is friendly but thats all, roomservice menu is small but quality and pricing are ok.So far everything is ok, altough I personally got one negative point.Because the rooms are large and equipt as a appartment and because all the rooms are located very private you can feel lonely. Maybe a litlle bit strange to post in a review but i really felt it this way, the rooms remind me at home, and you dont see lots of guests. Overall; good place to stay, reasonable pricing, small. May 11 2017 	Good Value for Money But do not expect a good service	I stayed in the HJ All Suites Hotel last year for the whole December before I found a nice Apartment. The Suites are about 50 sqm. You can choose between 1 or 2 bedroom suites with spacious living area, small kitchen but no kitchen supplies and a more or less big bathroom. The shower was ok and the heating bulbs were working. The Air condition, which is at the same time the heater was not really working in the bedroom. Therefore I had to leave my curtains closed for almost the whole 4 weeks. The staff is firendly but of actual no help. At the check in they could not find the reservation made by my company. It took me about 1 hour to check in. I ate only one time in the restaurant and had twice room service. It was ok but I thought a little bit too expensive. The location is only reachable by Taxi or you walk about 15 minutes to the next Subway station. The door man were friendly but did only know the famous places in Town. Otherwise you are better off without them. I would recommend the place again because of the spacious rooms but not because of the service. May 7 2017 	Small but good rooms	Neat and clean rooms.Good value for money. Some of the rooms are small and can do better. We didnt have the air con working in the sitting area, but didnt matter too much and they could have fixed it. Overall average experience, could have been better Feb 22 2017 	Good for Business not for Pleasure	I was recently in China on business and had the chance to stay in some pretty nice hotels. I ended my trip with a few days in Shanghai for some relaxation and stay at the Howard Johnson All Suites Hotel ( not to be confused with the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel). If you are staying at this hotel, make sure the taxi driver knows which one it is because mine didn't. I ended up at the Howard Johnson Plaza which is quite a ways away and actually in a better location. Who would have thought there would be two Howard Johnsons in Shanghai?Getting back to the hotel experience. Everyone was very nice and helpful, for the most part, when I arrived and checked-in. The only problem I had was the bell hop never brought my bag to my room. I ended up having to go back down to the lobby and get my bag and bring it up myself. No big deal. The food at the hotel was average but they did have a good breakfast in the morning. The room was very big with a seperate sleeping area, kitchen, large bathroom and living area. My only complaint about the room is the bed. The bed was hard as a rock. As this was true, it isn't necessarily a bad thing in China. Every hotel I stayed in had rock hard beds and they were all &quot;5 star&quot; hotels. One of the other American hotels in Shanghai may have softer beds.As for the location of the hotel, it isn't very good if you are there for vacation or leisure. There is really nothing within a short walking distance. I went out for a walk on a Saturday night and found no nightlife or shopping in the area. I did happen to find a cool hole-in-the-wall bar called Charlie's Coffee Bar on Nanjing W Rd. It had a nice atmosphere and the drinks were expensive.Next time I will stay closer to the shopping areas when I am in Shanghai but if you are there on business, this is a great place to stay. Aug 29 2006 	tasteful	The business suite was huge and you could really make it your home away from home there was even a kitchenette which I did not use but was a nice touch, the serivce was excellent, and the rooms very clean. The location was a bit far from everything and there were no special restaurants or attractions nearby but then you can't have everything, as the price was good. I would stay there again, it's close the hongqiao airport as well, and the hotel is well managed! May 29 2006	Suites a good choice accommodation	I stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment (2 couples) and we all enjoyed the stay. The rooms are large and each bedroom has a very comfortable Kingsize bed. Only one toilet/ bathroom. But has a kitchen, small office area and large lounge area. Also stayed for 2 nights in a one bedroom suite. This also had a good kingsize bed and small kitchenette. and shower (in both suites - no bath).Good small gym and business centre (open 8am to 10) Internent 10y for 10 mins then 1 y for each other minute, not fast, unfortunately.Service by the bellboys/conceirge was very good. Free China Daily and USA today available if you are fast.Check out service could do with some modernisation.I booked thru an internet site wotif and got excellent rates for the first 2 nights and when I wanted to extend my stay in the one br suite they sent me back to the website because they could not match the price.I would definitely opt for this choice if back in Shanghai. Caution There is a HJ hotel and a HJ All suites Hotel in Shanghai. May 7 2006 	A ship is only as good as its crew	A ship is only as good as its crew. The Howard Johnson as a hotel appears magnificent and there is no reason why it should not be. However;1 Arrived at the hotel to have room number scribbled down wrong.2 Showed up for breakfast and did not find bacon, sausages, hash browns etc in their places and had to chase up staff to get on top of the situation on 3 separate occasions (we stayed 5 nights).3 Used the shower after use of the pool and stood on a cigarette end in there.4 Had no faith in the door staff putting you in a taxi and sending you in the right direction, on our leaving we did use them one more time to ask taxi driver to take us to maglev train, to take us to airport, he took us straight to airport!!5 Hotel concierge by name only, great if you don’t ask any questions.Chose this hotel on recommendations from web, I suspect a managerial shake up would improve things here, as its stands I wouldn’t go back. Great hotel, motley crew! Mar 19 2006	On your own!	I hate to have to write this review, but after nearly missing my flight due to the negligence of the staff, I feel like I need to warn others. The Howard Johnson is indeed a luxury hotel in terms of appearance - a beautiful lobby, rooms, and spa. But it is not a luxury hotel in terms of service. I had booked transportation to the airport through the hotel and was told to wait in the lobby and they would inform me when the shuttle had arrived. 10 minutes after the scheduled departure I became worried so went to ask at the desk. As it turns out the shuttle had come and gone with no notice from the staff. To make matters worse they offered no alternate method of transportation, or even an apology. Thank God my partner spoke Mandarin and we were able to get a taxi (at 3X the price) to take us there. It was such a terrible way to have to end my vacation in Shanghai, I just don't want anyone else to have the same experience. Dec 2 2005	Fab suite!	We were upgraded by reception to a deluxe suite - and it was lovely! Very clean, recently refurbished, and it even had a small balcony. It was fairly modest, but you had more space than a hotel room.The hotel staff were very friendly, with a handful of them speaking fluent english.The only disadvantage was the taxi drivers seemed unsure of where the hotel was - even though it was on a main road. But the key card reception gives you has a map on it, so this helps. Would definately stay here again. Nov 10 2005	2 weeks at the Howard Johnson	My first trip to China and the company put me into the HJ for the 2 weeks. This is a brand new hotel and the numerous staff do fall over themselves to help. The suite I was in cost around 1200rmb per day and was really impressive with bedroom c/w king size and TV; kitchen; bathroom with shower and living room with seating for four or five, big TV, and desk with high speed access. The suite has more lights and light switches than an average house with as many as 8 light switches just to operate all the lights in just the bedroom alone!The good bits were1. A dining room that catered to western tastes including on-demand eggs the way you like them in the morning.2. An incredibly swift and efficient valet service that didn't keep my clothes for more than about 8 hours no matter what speed of service I requested.3. Good in-room internet access 4. Excellent coverage of European soccer on the cable feed!The drawbacks were 1. An air conditioner that just couldn't handle the Shanghai humidity even in November or keep the suite cool enough for a Canadian's taste2. An on-demand hot water system that had a mind of it's own and gave wildly fluctuating shower temperatures for about 45 seconds at a time.3. It's location out on the Yanan Road W. is not the greatest for reaching anything interesting on footAs a rookie to China, my feeling was that this was decent value for what I got compared with more central, downtown hotels.

"Sep 27 2021 	Best Service ever!!! Incredible Staff	Very helpful staff!! made our stay unforegettable experience.... Well Done! Aug 27 2021 	Nice and enjoyable business hotel	This hotel is a bargin! Its quite new. Wonderful bed. Nicely decorated room, decent shower. Jul 14 2021 	Best thing - Location. Worst thing - Location	I stayed in this hotel on the business trip. Rooms are comfortable and modern with a nice LCD TV and free wired Internet. Like the bathtub and all the amenities. The hotel is new after all. The only complaint about the room is the air conditioning blows right into your face so I ended up switching off the air conditioning in these hot summer nights. The best part of the hotel as many reviewers mentioned is the convenient location in downtown and near shopping and restaurants and subway. The worst part is also the location. It is at a busy intersection and shanghai drivers lover their horns. So you will be woken up at 6AM whether you like it or not. Also there is a huge construction site across the street so if the traffic does not wake you up the bulldozers and cranes will. Another down side is the elevators on the south end of the hotel is frequently used by staff and housekeeping so expect a long wait. North end elevators are fine. Jun 28 2021 	Exceeded expectations	The hotel is across the street from Four Seasons and two blocks away from Nanjing Lu. Starbucks is just downstairs and there are 24/h convenient stores, ATM and bakery just a block away. Walking distant to restaurants, DVD stores on Dagu Road and the club, SIN, is across the street. The hotel lobby is new and modern, but hotel staff are slightly weird (one of them couldn't stop staring at me). The room has a comtemporary feel to it and is nice and clean. internet is free, but wired. The room service menu after 11:30pm is sad with just 7 choices. But for RMB 630 nett/night on the weekends, it's a real bargin (Four seasons across the street charge RMB 1700/night +taxes). If you crave a cheaper option stil, check out Hanting Express down Shimen Road for around RMB300/night) May 7 2021 	A new concept of suites in the heart of Shanghai...	So many hotels in Shanghai and so many competitors too...Shanghai has everything to propose for spoiled travellers as me...Was very impressed by this hotel especially about the location, cannot find better... located at the opposite of Four Seasons Hotel and at few steps from the famous People Square.Rooms, well we need to say more suites are impeccable, well designed with nice furniture, color shades and excellent amenities, really appreciated the bedding, lighting and the large list of TV channels. The complimentary internet access and Wi Fi thru the hotel is a plus.Staff and services are fine especially security and doormen who will assist you at anytime for a taxi and many things we need when we are in a hotel.Good job and not easy to be different in Shanghai... Apr 30 2021 	Not bad for the price and location	I stayed for eight days to visit friends and meet business contacts. I set my expectations low based on limited reviews online. The room rates were reasonable at the time and internet connection was included (wired. no wifi in rooms). The location is across the street from Four Seasons. It's 5 minutes walk to Nanjing Lu subway station. Central enough to walk to most attractions around Shanghai. It’s one of the main reasons I selected this hotel versus others of similar quality.Overall, the lobby and facilities are just 'ok'. Nothing grand. The details and the layout seemed a bit off. Once I got into the room however, I was impressed. The room I received looks to be 1 of 2 unique room layouts (see photos). The windows span the length of the room which is very nice. Bathroom details were modern, very nice and clean. Towels were big, soft and comfortable. The bed was great. Sheets and pillows very comfortable. Lounge chair and work desk were well placed, modern and convenient. The windows were operable in the bedroom and bath which allows fresh air (Shanghai Fresh) to circulate. Since I previously lived in Shanghai, I never requested room service or required much assistance. Overall, service was good. I could tell that the people were still being trained and they are trying to maintain high standards. It wasn't perfect (staff at the door were not always personable or outwardly friendly) but the front desk and individual encounters with staff were good. Even the cleaning lady by the elevator greeted us (ni hao) unexpectedly and reveals some training to welcome and greet guests. I'd give special credit to the bell boy (Mr. Smith) for getting the room in order and finding umbrellas during a downpour. The room was well cleaned daily. They never knocked when the ‘do not disturb’ light was on. The gym is adequate. I used is one of the three treadmills during my stay. The outdoor tennis court was nice. I looked for the basement pool but got lost trying to locate it. Based on the quality of the room, I'd recommend this hotel to friends who were looking for a decent hotel though I caution about the construction across the street.Notes of Caution: (1)There is construction currently in progress in front of the hotel. It looks like its just getting started. Expect some noise. It was tolerable while I was there though it did continue past 10pm. The Four Seasons guest also have to put up with the same thing but they're probably paying at least 2x more. (2) There is a whiskey lounge bar next door (same building but separate entrance). Although it’s on the ground floor, you can hear singing and music up to the 20th floor. (3) all rooms seem to allow smoking. There was no odor in my room though this may change as it seeps into the carpet and curtains. (4) The signage &quot;Howard Johnsons&quot; is tiny. Coming from the airport, you might not know you have arrived at the right location since even taxi drivers are just getting familiar with the hotel name. Mar 26 2021 	Practical business hotel reasonably convenient with limited amenities	Convenience - doesn't even offer the most basic service of currency exchange, staff said the hotel has `just opened' in December so service wasn't ready yet, though it's already been three months. Location - none of the cab drivers recognized the name of the hotel. Better tell them it's opposite Four Seasons Hotel. Don't expect much to see around the area for shopping/sightseeing. Restaurant - getting lunch/dinner is a problem. only one restaurant (cafe) in the entire hotel, which serves buffet breakfast. Dinner is not impressive at all - below average Western and Asian dishes with a three-page menu. Disappointing for the price charged at a four-to-five-star hotel. Starbucks right next door.Hotel staff said there are cheap food stalls selling local snacks within 5-10 mins walk. Haven't seen for myself though.Service - Marco at the concierge was exceptionally helpful. Offered to help my family to buy a meal from local restaurants nearby. Brought back scrumptious food within 10 mins. On another instance, I was trying to check a boutique that I saw in Beijing but a staff only asked me to look around local department stores without offering more help. Deluxe rooms aren't spacious at all, looking over new residential building. But a clean, nice bathroom compensated part of that.Huge plus is all guests are required to insert room key in the elevator to access to all floors to ensure security. If you are just looking for a safe, comfortable place to stay and dont require much amenities, go for this one.Taxi to hotel from airport costs about RMB 150. Sep 25 2021 	Buon hotel ma un pò fuori mano"
"Nov 1 2021 	Hidden Gem. No Westin but perfectly fine.	Why would you want to stay there?* Value-conscious shopper* Be in the heart of the French Concession* Stay in a newish (though not brand new) establishment* Be able to get to the metro in under 5 minutes on foot. * Be close to bars and restaurants* Spotlessly clean, flat screen TV, comfy bed with good quality linen.Why wouldn't you want to stay there?* If you prefer generously proportioned roomsHow much?* expect to pay just under US$100 a night.This hotel is now my default choice when travelling for leisure. Oct 29 2021 	Fantastic hotel	Stayed there for a couple of nights,could have done with more. The room is fabulous,bathroom is superb. Bell hops and concierges were all extremely helpful. Location is faultless. Lots of eating places around the area and also small boutiques for shopping. Sep 28 2021 	Great hotel great location	My parents go to Shanghai nearly every year and normally stay at the Donghu Hotel which is right up the street from the new HoJo HuaiHai. However we decided to give HoJo a chance this time as the hotel was recently completed and was advertising a very good promotional rate. The rooms were excellent - very comfortable, not as big as the Donghu but still a comfortable size. The showers were high pressure and felt great. Location is great - on a major commercial artery in Puxi, walking distance to a number of shops and restaurants, short cab ride (or long walk) to a number of bar areas, near 2 subway stations if you want to take public transport. We didn't try the restaurant at the hotel -- it appeared to serve mostly Western food so we were not interested. Sep 15 2021 	Great staff great location a very nice hotel to call home for a week	My wife and I started our Honeymoon around the world at this hotel and we are very pleased with our choice of this fabulous hotel. We were greeted nicely everytime we came or went from the hotel. The staff we always very nice and helpful and did their best to answer our questions. Not everyone's english was perfect but it was more than adequate for anyone with a modicum of patience. The location is a long city block away from a grocery and a shopping mall. In the same place as the grocery and the shopping is the train station which is your portal to the rest of shanghai. There are some very good restaurants a stones throw away as well. The hotel was clean and quiet. The amenities were good as well. Being able to watch the NBA playoffs in the morning was different but enjoyable. For those travelers who don't speak the local language(s) be sure to grab a map and a &quot;take me home&quot; card from the concierge. It will make getting home so much easier. Also don't be afraid to ask your concierge for anything that you are looking for. They will either go and find it for you or send you in the right direction (marked on your map).We look foward to staying here again, Jun 16 2021 	Exploring the French Concession - Start here!	A good place to stay if you wish to explore the French Concession, which is one of the very few spots that offer something close to a pleasant walk in Shanghai. The hotel is 10min from the Line 1 Shaanxi Nanlu (Shaanxi Road South) Station, 15min in the rain. No easy access to 24-hr stores, but you can stock up on water and snacks at the basement of Parksons (mall above metro) on your way back to the hotel. Touts at traffic junctions.Huaihai Zhonglu (the former Avenue Joffre), on which the metro sits, offers loads of dining and shopping choices. It leads out to quieter streets where you get spots of culture and history (eg. Donghu hotel, Ruijin hotel, Fuxing Park, former residence of Sun Yat Sen, former residence of Soong Ching-ling, or even Xintiandi - all walkable from this hotel). A quieter, almost pretty spot away from the rest of Shanghai under construction.Stay at this hotel if you don't want to have to put up with the remotest possibility of encountering mold, rust, dirt or aging furniture, and yet don't want to pay 5-star rates. Was upgraded to a deluxe room after 1 night in a superior room due to a faulty lock, but could not really tell the difference, except the complimentry plate of fruits and maybe a &quot;better&quot; view on a higher floor? Nothing to shout about, the sky's all grey and polluted everywhere.You get HBO and the usual fare on cable in all rooms. Buffet breakfast has a decent variety: Chinese porridge and the usual eggs, ham and cereal. They will ask for a 600-yuan deposit at check-in, no matter what your online agent says. Apr 12 2021 	A good place for shopper and nightlife...	Certainly one of the best locations in Shanghai.Nice hotel with very comfortable and clear rooms including LCD TV with a good choice of international channels.Complimentary internet in the room.Interesting design for the bathroom (especially the wash bassin) and all white.Really like the duckies!!!! on the tub.Bedding and mattress was excellent for a good sleep after a good shopping and night life...Eco friendly hotel using only recycling paper or fabrics instead of plastic.Good job and congratualtions for that.Bell boy service was good at check in and check out. Feb 20 2021 	Excellent Hotel and very good location	Room are very clean and nice.Free internet service is an advantage.Friendly staff.Over all an excellent choice !!! Dec 1 2018 	Great Hotel great service good location	It was my first visit to Shanghai, I spend 4 nights at this hotel and I can really say the rooms are excelent, the bathroom very nice and clean (as it should be), very modern and confortable bedroom, the restaurant of the hotel serves good food, the attention at the lobby and the concierge was extremely nice, cordial and impecable. I will definitely go back to this hotel in my next visit to Shanghai. Nov 22 2018 	just perfect	Really enjoyed my stay there.Rooms where clean. The room was equipped with everything I could think of.Location is perfect.Breakfast was fresh and tasty.Price was extremely affordable for an hotel in this quality.no view from the hotel back rooms though. Aug 24 2018 	Can't wait to come back!	The building is magnificent, HIGH quality design and atmosphere. The service was friendly and very helpful. Most of the staff understands English. My room exceeds expectations, the exercise facility has treadmills, free weights, combo exercise machine, and other equipment...it also has 2 flat screen tv's, bottles of water and towels. The restaurant is great, the breakfast is AMAZING, they have traditional Chinese dishes along w/ traditional American breakfast foods like bacon, eggs, pancakes, etc. I highly recommend staying here, my stay has been comfortable, seemless and very ENJOYABLE! Jul 16 2018 	Wow!	After having stayed in Shanghai several times, I finally decided to give the Hojo Hua Hai Rd a try. It's location is just off the famous Hua Hai Rd, smack in the middle of the former French Concession. Upon walking into the small but adequate lobby you will be confronted with sit down check in, very friendly and helpful staff.The rooms are a greater surprise with new furnishings, all the mod cons, whopping big LCD TV on the wall, rubber duckie's in the bath tub and separate shower and bath. Views are straight across the French Concession.Not to mention that English wasn't a problem, even for the housekeeping staff, and the service from the bell boys is slick. Overall I cant possibly find fault with hotel, the best I have seen in it's 4 star class in Asia. Nov 16 2021 	De bonne qualite personel parlant anglais Apr 13 2021 	Muy buena ubicacion Jan 3 2021 	??????"
"Nov 11 2021 	Good location for a quick first visit.	I decided to stay at the Howard Johnson as this was my first trip to Shanghai and I wanted to be in a fairly central location. Being a business trip of 3 days, time to see the city was also limited, so the central location worked well. Being right near Nanjing Rd, there are many shops - both individual and in shopping centres, and restaurants to choose from.The staff are pleasant and helpful, assisting me in trying to change a flight booking. Breakfast is the above average for the usual hotel buffet style however the price was a bit on the higher side. The hotel offers free internet in all rooms, which is very handy to have. I had a great view over the East Nanjing Rd pedestrian mall, the rooms were of good size, and the bathroom quite large. Complimentary bottled water is also provided each day, which is handy to have.I had one afternoon with 3-4 free hours, and decided to take a quick walk around the French Concession area. If I were to visit Shanghai again, I would most likely look for something in this area seeing as I have experienced 'central' Shanghai now. Oct 5 2021	Great location	Great location near Nanjing Road (though not as good as Sofitel). Great breakfasts choices and tastes. Nice clean rooms. Had a good view of Nanjing Road. Overall great stay. Sep 17 2021 	Very Near shoppings park and museum.	Decided to try 1 night with this hotel after few nights stays with Westin. Location wise is great, right next to Nanjing road, nearby People's park where you wil find Tai Chi excercises in the morning. Also the Shanghai museum which is within the park.Staff extremely helpful and also encourage me to join their membership ( free) in order to get room disc and free upgrades. Everything you expect from a 4 star ( i would rate it) and value for money. Henan metro station is closeby. Alot of attractions are within taxi rides of RMB 11 ( The taxi fares in shanghai starts at RMB11) Aug 3 2021 	Great location nice hotel	I read some reviews on here and got a bit worried, but this hotel was fine. Found the staff helpful and the location is excellent. Very reasonable price too. I would certainly recommend it. Jul 31 2021 	Avoid this Hotel	There is no customer service at this hotel. I had a medical problem and required a doctor; the response was ‘go find one’ from the assistant manager supposedly “there to help you!”. I checked out and went over to the Westin Hotel…a world of difference, better rooms, much better service, and a doctor arrived within half an hour. Jul 3 2021 	Ordinary with minimal customer service	The location is great, but nothing else stands out. The rooms are very average (we stayed in a much nicer Ho Jo in Ningbo) and breakfast is not included. This was the only hotel of four during our trip where it was not part of the package. We had some confusion on our reservation, even though it had been made from the concierge counter of the Ningo HoJo, and there was little attempt on the part of the staff the help clarify. We had a fluent Mandarin speaker with us, so language was not the issue. Jun 18 2021 	Amazing location in Shanghai	Welcoming lilies in the lobby, free upgrade to the business floor, two steps to Nanjing road, good feng shui in the rooms… We could not ask for more. There is plenty to do around the hotel to blend in Shanghai’s local’s lifestyle. We went to People’s park in the early morning to watch people practice Tai Chi, walked around Nanjing road in the morning where you will find people dancing. There are good and very inexpensive massage places all around the hotel area (I highly recommend Xuanni for US$8 one hour foot massage with Ahen na(#8) and Lej yuanjiu (#9) they are doing some construction on the first floor there, but don’t be scared, the place is on the second floor is quite nice.) Jun 2 2021 	excellent hotel with great service	posh hotel, great service, however the adjacent open market as people chase you for marketing, try for high floor for an excellent view May 16 2021 	Good stay	The hotel is in a superb location - it could hardly be better. Near the Bund, Nanjing Shopping Street etc,. The hotel is very good - impressive lobby, good modern rooms - many with great views. I got a good deal on the room by booking online. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel - I thought that it was too expensive - but there are more than enough nearby places to eat breakfast in. I would certainly recommend it if you want to stay in the centre of Shanghai. Apr 29 2021 	Great Experience	HoJo was fine. A little pricey but all hotels in Shanghai are a little pricey. HotelService was great. English was spoken by all staff and they were very attentive and helpfulBreakfast was excellent, a very international mix of dishes and a relaxing atmosphere.Check-in and Check-out were fast, efficient, and with no incidentRoomLarge and clean. I found the room a little warm, but I found all the rooms I stayed in on this visit a little warm. I think it had to do with the time of year (April), and a transition from Furnace to AirCon.Television had a mix of international channels. Clean bath with all necessary amenities.Noise was not an issue, very quiet room.LocationVery close to Nanjing Road, lots of shops and restaurants nearby.Walking distance to the Bund and many sites.I will definately consider this hotel again next time I am in Shanghai. Nov 21 2018 	HoJo to the Rescue	Wow--was a Howard Johnson Hotel or a Hilton--what a difference another continent makes!My wife and I stayed two nights at the Howard Johnson after ditching our previous hotel (the Bailemen) after one night. We read getting an affordable hotel room in Shanghai was tough and we spent a full morning running down the Nanjing Lu to find an affordable hotel.After trying the Marriott and Radisson hotels, we happened upon the Howard Johnson. At first the receptionist insisted on a price of $1600 RMB, but we negotiated the price down to $1000 RMB per night (it was more than we wanted to spend, but we didn't want to spend the night in another creepy hotel).The hotel was clean and the room was well appointed with marble tile bathrooms and counter tops. Prices for the mini-bar were par with luxury U.S. hotels, but the room was spacious, smoke-free, provided cable (including CNN and HBO), and a wonderful view of the neon nightlife along the Nanjing Lu.We also had the buffet dinner. It wasn't amazing, but is was quite good--with a range of western dishes, sushi, seafood, fresh fruit and dessert bar.We would definitely stay at the Howard Johnson again, it was a welcome refuge from our previous hotel! Nov 18 2018 	One of the best hotels I visit in Asia	I have been doing some business travel in 4 countries of Asia. And up to this time, I have to say that this is the best of all hotels I have visited. Very classy and clean room, sharp and funcional bathroom, lcd tv, great attention from all personnel (all of them talks english), the hotel is well located and near (couple of blocks) of Mc Donalds and Starbucks, for those who wants to remementer the taste of home. The only thing I guess they can improve is the menu on their cafeteria; they serve the same thing almost every day, even for breakfast. Sep 4 2018 	Great hotel for the price	This was my 4th time to Shanghai this year. Prior to this visit, I stayed on the Pudong side (work related reasons) of Shanghai at the Holiday Inn. If you're coming to Shanghai for sightseeing/vacation, stay on the Pushi side of Shanghai. The neighborhood:The hotel's in a very convenient located. It's right across from Nanjin Lu witch is a touristy area. I found 3 Starbucks and 1 Coffee Bean within a 4 block radius. Nanjin Lu and the surrounding area is great for shopping. There a subway station that you can get to within 5-10 minutes walking. The Hotel:This was my first time staying at Howard Johnson. I would recommend this hotel to friends if they came to Shanghai. The room that I got was clean, didn't smell like smoke, and the view from my room on the 10th floor was very nice. I believe most rooms have a window that faces north (like mine), and overlooks nanjin lu. i was happy with the number of TV channel that were aired in english (about 7).The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and their english was good for chinese standards.Room service is 24hours. Their menu was okay, but was a little shorter than other hotel room service menus.Asides from eating room service, I only tried the hotel buffet which was similar to the other hotels I've stayed in China. It was about $20 US (depending on the exchange rate). The quality and selection of the food was okay. Asides from being convenient, I wouldn't recommend it for the price.I didn't have time to try out the amenities and other services that the hotel offered during my 3 night stay.Overall, I'd recommend this hotel to almost anyone who was visiting Shanghai. The only group that I wouldn't recommend this hotel would be Honeymooners. Jun 23 2018 	Not bad nor great	I went to shanghai for business/pleasure. Intel arranged for me to stay here for 1 week. My room a a great view and nice/clean bathrooms. Excellent location!!! The restaurant was crap, I rather eat out. Not really a 5 star hotel, more like a 3-4 star..... Oct 18 2007	Wonderful position	This hotel is perfectly located in the centre of Shanghai.10minutes walking distance from the Bound.It's perfect if you are there for 1-2 night. a perfect place where to stay.Rooms are big, clean, with many amenities.Restaurants are good only if you take the buffet....otherwise definetly better all the resturants out in area. Sep 26 2007 	Confusing....	The location of the hotel is excellent. However, plenty of little issues that need to be addressed. Our booking was, very straightforward, booked through a travel agent, for 2 connecting rooms (2 adults, 2 kids) and airport transfers. I was told before that there were no connecting room in this hotel, which is amazing considering the size/ number of rooms. We settled for adjoining rooms. As I only received one key, I assumed that the room perhaps was connecting after all. Upon arriving at the room, we discovered that it was just ONE room, with a king-sized bed... Back down to the reception counter to ask for our second room. Ah yes... No adjoining room was available. Not good. Upon departure I noticed they posted the airport transfer charges to my bill, which I settled in advance with the travel agent already. This took 25 minutes to clarify with their reservations department and the travel agent's office. Despite that I provided them with a voucher etc. They really ought to look at their Front Office operation.On a positive note; the breakfast was good, and so was housekeeping. Sep 20 2007	Fantastic	We booked a deluxe room and were given a small suite on the 17th floor overlooking Nanjing pedetrianised shopping street. Absolutely fabulous. Room large and beautifuully equipped with wonderful service. Fantastic location - could not be bettered. Restaurant excellent and the buffets were terrific and incredible value (different theme every night). Marvellous lobby and bar with first rate service. Not cheap but very real value for money. Highly recommended. Din't miss the skyline on the Hangpu River about 10 minutes walk. Fantastic by day and wonderful at night. Jun 15 2007 	Outstanding	Attending a wedding held in one of the restaurants, our large family group spent 4 nights at the Ho-Jo and we could not have been more pleased. From the reception staff to the doorman to the wait staff, everyone was friendly and professional. The rooms were large and modern. Most importantly, they were immaculate, something not always seen in China's hotels. The bathrooms were large and rather elegant. Some of us had views of Nanjing Road and its brilliant lights. One highlight was the buffet breakfast. There were literally dozens of breakfast choices including both Western and Asian dishes, with a chef to whip up the omelet of your choice. The coffee and tea were fresh brewed and delicious. The location was perfect. Just a block from Nanjing Road, there were unlimited shopping possibilities. A walk to the river took less than 15 minutes. Also, it was a short walk to the subway, giving us access to the entire city. Overall, this was our best experience in China and we would not hesitate to recommend this fine hotel to anyone visiting Shanghai. Oct 12 2006 	Good place	Rooms comfortable and well equipped. Great buffet, western style breakfast. Good location for shopping.no free internet though. Comparable to a 3-star US hotel. Sep 28 2006 	The 'HoJo' - a pretty good choice!	Having read some of the previous reviews we were a bit worried about the 5 star self rating, and the fact that a number of people complained that despite booking a non smoking room ended up in a smoking room. On the basis of these reviews I rang two nights before our arrival and confirmed our booking for twin beds/non smoking. On arrival we were advised that the hotel was full and that there were no twin/non smoking rooms available. The hotel proposed that we take a king bed room (not suitable for mother and teenage son) or smoking room twin. I was thankful that I had rung to confirm the booking and so could reiterate this in our negotiations. In the end, and without too much difficulty, we were placed in a suite with a roll-out bed for the first night and then re-located to our twin/non smoking room the next day. Throughout our 7 nights staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were great and equipped/re-stocked with all 4-5 star ammenities, inlcuding robes and slippers (noted by a previous guest as absent). The hotel is well located in the city - particulary in relation to the metro, and cabs (very cheap) were always available outside the hotel. The only downside to the hotel was the very overpriced and poor standard buffet breakfast ($30AU per person). Other options in the local neighbourhhood were not that great either - though we did find a 'french baguette' bakery just a two blocks away. Aug 2 2006 	Very nIce hotel 4-1/2 stars	Stayed here 5 nights for business/pleasure. Rooms were very nice. Marble bathrooms (though the toilet sometimes ran if not flushed just so). Bottled water was replenished two times a day in the room. Great location, close to most tourist spots. Fitness center was decently equipped (free weights, treadmills, bikes, rowing machines) and a nice sized indoor pool. Multiple saunas and hot tubs (not quite hot enough). Never saw anyone using it. Breakfast buffet was fine. Nothing gourmet but nice all the same. Staff was friendly and helpful, made great recommendations and would write directions in Chinese for taxis. The staff demeanor seemed to reflect the attitude of whoever they were speaking to. If someone was being overly rude and angry, the hotel person became very stone-faced. However, I found a friendly tone was met with a very friendly response.My only disappointment was how expensive laundry was (US$2 for underwear, $US5 for a t-shirt) though it was quick. I'm sure that there are nicer hotels with better amenities, but this one was very good. Between 4 and 5 stars. Jul 30 2006	Mediocre	I recently stayed at the Howard Johnson in the Huangpu District of Shanghai. I found it mediocre despite being rated as a 5 star hotel. While checking in, we found the staff unfriendly. They put us on the smoking floor. We requested for transfer to a non-smoking floor as I am asthmatic and the man behind the desk acted like it was an imposition. He checked his computer and told us curtly that it was impossible as the hotel was fully booked. We were scheduled to stay in the hotel for 5 nights, so I requested we be informed of any vacancies on the non-smoking floors during our stay. While the man (his name was Michael) replied in the affirmative, he wore a heavily burdened expression as if our request was totally unreasonable. We never heard from him again. The breakfast buffet was unsatifactory. I fould the choices wanting and the food was on the bland and oily side. I would think twice about staying at the Howard Johnson again. Jul 10 2006	Excellent hotel fantasitc staff good breakfast great location	This hotel exceeded our expectations from the start, however in order to remain objective I will put forward the areas that need some improvement. The check-in was efficient and the rooms were grand, commanding and spacious. The hotel has all the facilities of a 5 stat hotel - restaurants, gym, concierge, pool and more. The hotel decor is very grand and quite Chinese in style which very much suits the city.The breakfasts were good, the fruit selection however was not as good as it could be. The selection were the &quot;basic&quot; fruits, once on the road we found more local fruits and more exotic fruits I would have liked to seen on the buffet. The concierge were so so helpful and were very efficient and went above and beyond their duties. The club floor needs some improvement as the nightly cocktail selection is not quite as good as other hotels. The location of the hotel is very good - 5 minute taxi to The Bund, French Concession, Nanjing Pedestrian Mall, Old City and all within walking distance.Would stay again very happy. No problems. May 8 2006	Surely not a 5 Star Hotel	the room is good but the toilet inside the room got flooded easily.unlike some 5 star international hotels which we have visited in other parts of the worldi, this hotel does not provide bath robe or sleepers made for kids.. the spa facility on the 6th floor is very poor especially the decor and the facilities. For example, i had to wait for over 10 minutes before there was hot water in the shower areas. There was only one bottle of what appears to be shower gel in each shower room. The bottle was not labelled and one had to guess what it was. If that was indeed shower gel, then something else which one could invariably find in 5 stars hotels are obviously missing. It seemed that the the entire spa facility was inherited from the previous hotel without any substantial improvement works as the decor and the shower facility look old.Aapart from some cotton tips and a tissue box, there wasn't any other toiletries such as face cream, lotion, in the women's changing room. I understood from my husband that there was also no razor or shaving cream provided in the male changing room. the choice of food in room service is limited and some of the food is very expensive. for example, a bowl of corn soup costs RMB95 whereas the best Chinese restaurant voted by Talter Shanghai only sells it at RMB38. generally, the staff speak fairly good English but when my 8 years old daughter called up the service centre (they do not call it housekeeping) and asked for a tooth brush, the staff tried to correct her English by saying &quot;you mean a teeth brush?&quot; and when I said &quot;three people&quot; in reply to the receptionist's question at the coffee shop before she sat us down, she tried to correct my English by saying &quot;you mean three persons&quot;.there is no priority for taxi even if you are a hotel guest and you have to queue up for taxi behind non-hotel guests. we witnessed a fight between some local people and the hotel valet parking staff which became physical whilst queuing up for the taxi.there is a system in this hotel that they will lend only one brolly for each room whilst it is raining. So even if you stay with your spouse and each of you may be heading different directions, you have to work out with your spouse who is going to use that brolly and who is to be soaked in the rain.one thing worthy of mention about this hotel is the answer given by a lfit attendant when we asked her how many stars this hotel has. Her initial answer was this was a 5 star hotel and when being asked further why no sign was put up to tell its guests how many stars this hotel has, her answer was the hotel was built in accordance with 5 star standards and they are applying for it to be so branded Apr 29 2006	Enjoyed the Howard Johnson	This hotel exceeded our expectations. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The resaurants were very good; the morning breakfast was exceptional. The hotel staff are very accomodating and helpful with directions, etc. The hotel is conveniently located and is a very good location for walking around the city of Shangai. Mar 31 2006	A Good Hotel Experience	I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and was satisfied with the room and service. It's not the best hotel in Shanghai, but it's not bad.The lobby is very nice with seating areas for coffee or drinks. Food from the restaurants and the sandwich/chocolate shop was good and reasonably priced. The concierge is very helpful here - they happily accomodated all our requests and wrote our destination in Chinese on a card for us to give to the cabdrivers. Laundry service is a bit pricey but everything was returned promptly.The room is a decent size, as is the bathroom. Water is NOT filtered here. The closet is very small and you cannot close the doors with a suit jacket hanging, which is inconvenient as closing the doors extinguishes the light. There is an in-room safe.The beds are the hardest I have ever seen - like a cement pad! Linens are nice, towels are fine.Internet access in the business center is pricey, but local calls can be made for a reasonable charge in the business center. Be warned - just to pick up the phone in your room and dial an 800 number will cost you Y$35.Location is good for the Pu Xi side. Sometimes cabs are plentiful, sometimes not.My only complaint with this hotel - they told us we had a non-smoking room. As we went to our room, a hotel worker ran in in front of us, gathered up all the ashtrays, and said &quot;Now non-smoking!&quot;. You have to bully your way into a non-smoking room - only the pregnant people in our group got an actual non-smoking room. Mar 28 2006	Great hotel excellent service	I stayed at this beautiful property for 6 nights and really enjoyed it. The rooms were modern and nicely decorated with dark woods. The service was overall outstanding. The employees welcome you, open doors for you, and even call the lifts for you. Also the gym was spotless and well equipped.The Bund is walking distance from the hotel and numerous shops are right outside. The only negative is the insanely inflated prices for the bar, so you should walk outside to a minimart and buy beer for almost nothing. Sep 28 2005	Better than the JW Marriott	Half of our tour group of 50 people were dropped off to stay at the JW Marriott. I explored the JW and was feeling dismayed that my half of the group was headed for the Howard Johnson Plaza instead. Those feelings were dispelled as soon as I entered the HoJo's beautifully appointed lobby which was being decorated for Christmas. My husband and I had two double beds in our room which over-looked busy NanJing road. The room was spacious and comfortable with a tub/shower combination in the bathroom. We had the breakfast buffet at both hotels and the HoJo's beat out the JW in variety, freshness, and ambiance. The location of our hotel was also much more convenient to the city's amenities! This Howard Johnson is nothing like the HoJo's back home! I'd stay here again! Jul 19 2005 	It's like a state-owned enterprise - avoid	The decoration is good if uninspired. Lots of hotel like this all over China. Nothing special here. But service was just terrible.We had one executive suite and 4 rooms. But we were never told of the $72 special beforehand, so we paid around 30% more. Later, we saw the special prominently advertised at the airport when we were leaving Shanghai!On arrival around 5 pm, we wanted to have a meeting over tea and snacks at the coffee shop for 8 people before we went out to to a trade show. They won't let us have a large table so we can't sit together, saying those were booked for buffet dinner. We were an hour before that and promised to leave before their dinner time. But, no is no. We asked, then, if they can put two small tables together for us. Again, no. When we demanded a reason, the reply was an incredible &quot;We don't do that sort of thing in a grand hotel like this.&quot;We returned late and hoped to catch supper at the Chinese restaurant. Although we were 15 minutes before last order time, they won't let us in. Back to the coffee shop. For 4 of us, they gave us only 2 menus to look at. We requested 2 more, but were ignored by the waitress. So we talked to the manager, who first said he had searched around only there is no other menu around. We told him that can't possibly be right because there were 12 tables of diners and what if any one of them needs a menu? He thought about that, and then gave us a tale about &quot;another department&quot; having borrowed all the menu, even though it was dinner time. Even he felt embarrassed telling it. A minute later he changed his story about having to update the menu, again during dinner time. This was preposterous when a glass of Evian water was $6. We ended up complaining to the hotel's night manager, who of course apologized. He said &quot;now I know what your problem is.&quot; I simply told him, &quot;No, but you know what your hotel's problem is now.&quot;Howard Johnson should go back to doing the budget segment, even in China. In future, we shall avoid this hotel at all cost. Or at least send someone from North America to take a look at this! Jun 18 2005 	Not your Usual HoJo!	This might be the best kept secret in town for the location and value. Don't get scared off by the HoJo connection, it is a very lovely hotel opened only since 2003. It has one of the best location in Shanghai, just a few steps from the famous walking street - Nanjing Road where you can find everything from Pearl City(great prices and selection) to Silk King(custom made clothing in a day); Pizza Hut to local delicacies. An easy walk to the People's Square and Shanghai museum to the west and 20 min. walk to the Peace Hotel and the Bund to the east. You can even walk to the Yu Garden where the old city is within 30 min. When you first walk in the hotel, the beautiful lobby area immediately tells you it is not your usual HoJo - grand entry way with Italian marble floor. Hotel rooms are modern, spacious and nicely decorated with high speed internet connection; if you can upgrade to the jr. suite, you even have a nice sitting room with TV and other amenities. It also has a very beautiful full service spa and gym. Breakfast is very good with both eastern and western hot and cold selections. In addition, there is an egg station cook to order. Hotel staff are generally helpful and friendly. Once I stay here, it is hard to go to another hotel in Shanghai - you just can't beat the location, and for what you pay for, it is a superb deal! Sep 19 2004 	They try so hard......	I have stayed in this hotel several times, and each time I get more satisfied than the last. This is not an ostentatious hotel, and neither is it of top-class quality. I am attracted to its superb location (right next to Nanjing East Road). The staff try very hard to please, and I do see their sincerity. But somehow, they just lack that little bit of inspiration you see among service providers at world-class hotels. In terms of facilities, this hotel is more than adequate. To me, this is very much a 4-star plus hotel (though they say it's five), and it attracts lots of Americans familiar with the HoJo brand (and expecting it to be similar to at home, only to be pleasantly surprised). It also attracts a fair bit of local travellers, i.e. Chinese businessmen and tour groups. Not that I dislike such stuff, but having some exclusivity does helps, and this case, it lessens the good experience somewhat... Still, overall an impressive act. Recommended for those seeking a decent place without needing to pay through their nose. Sep 1 2021 	Ottima scelta Aug 28 2021 	????????????

"Nov 18 2021	Beautiful incredible fancy great amenities	Simply wow ! This was another wonderful surpirse on my Pacific Delight Tour. Hotel is located a good distance away from the main shopping areas by the river, however it's a good location (only one block to the subway). BTW - the subway system is probably the most beautiful clean and modern in the world. It was a short trip to Pudong. The hotel is also located next to the soccer stadiums that were used for the Olympics and the is a pretty good mall a block away.The lobby is luxurious, staff is amazing. The restaurants are far above what I expexted. There is even a little ice cream shop and a small casual snack restuarant if you just want a casual drink and a sandwich. There is also a luxurious restaurant with entertainment. Business center with very cheap internet. My room wasa spacious and smarlty decorated, bathroom was very large with a large sink and counter. My view was so cool - I could see the stadiums. Don;t miss a ride on the glass elevator at nightime. Sep 29 2021 	Good Value Not great location	Stayed here one night on a recent trip to Shanghai. Located just outside the Shanghai Indoor Stadium Station on lines 1 &amp; 4 of the metro. Also close to the sightseeing bus centre at the Shanghai Stadium which was the main reason we booked here. The hotel was a pleasant suprise with a lovely breakfast buffet. Fortunately, it was included in the room rate. As for the central parts of Shanghai, it is a bit inconvenient, but the metro is easy enough to negotiate with signs and maps in English. Aug 11 2021	Very Good hotel good amenities good food	We stayed here as part of our tour group package. Our last day, we had as an exploration day, and the staff recommended that we take a cab to the People's Park, versus taking the nearby subway. It was hot and humid and cab was definitely the way to go, as the hotel is not located in the central part of the city, but who knows what is central anymore as the city has 19 million people and is in the process of constructing for a population of 33 million! The staff was very helpful and the food was excellent. We used the fitness center, which was also very good. There is a pool, but we did not have time for it. It looked fine. The fitness center has windows overlooking one of the many highways that connects to the area and is very good. We found the room to be spacious and comfortable, and the bed comfortable compared to most of the other hotels on our tour. We did stay at a 5-star hotel in Beijing at the beginning of our tour, and this hotel is almost there, but not quite. I'd say a 4 star and a good one. Jul 30 2021 	Clean friendly but nothing spectacular...	Not that I was expecting anything spectacular, but the Hua Ting bills itself as a 5-Star hotel. It certainly has the amenities, and is conveniently located near a subway stop, but there's nothing charming about this hotel, and it's located pretty far from downtown. We were there to explore Shanghai and wished we had stayed closer to downtown. May 12 2021	Five Star	This is a five star hotel in a remarkable and changing city. It is not centrally located, but is very near the subway. The food and rooms are excellent. Most of the staff speak very good English. To give you an example of the service, one of the guests on our tour found out that their camera batteries were dead. One of the bell people took a taxi, went to a store, found several makes of batteries that would fit, called the guest back and mentioned the brand names and prices, and asked which battery they wanted. This is above and beyond the call of duty. Jan 24 2021 	Helpful Staff ..Great breakfast.. average hotel rooms	I've always stayed at this place when in Shanghai. What kept me going back is the location, friendly and helpful staff and good buffet breakfast.I'd like to mention one name particularly and thank her for her service ...I think she is the lobby /assistant lobby manager - TINA. I was running late for an important meeting in another town and needed to take a train and she understood the urgency of the situation and planned everything from getting the tickets to arranging taxi and making sure the taxi driver does his best in getting me out ASAP. The hotel rooms are above average, but the buffet is healthy and pretty good.If you have any questions please feel free to e-mail me at vmail19@yahoo.com Jan 7 2021 	Great food	Best food that I had in China, plenty and very tasty. Excellent hotel (modern design, nice &amp; clean rooms) with a nice view of the Olympic Stadium. The business center had expensive internet rate. Great location, you are next to the Metro (line 1). Nice swimming pool (on the 3rd floor) with sauna, steam room, aerobic. Nov 20 2018	Very expensive breakfast	I have stayed here before and returned due to its location (adjacent to subway line 1) as it was convenient for my meetings in Shanghai. This time the price was higher as I did not enjoy the special pricing of the holidays. More importantly breakfast was not included. The breakfast bufffet is good but the price is outragious. This is by far the most I have paid for breakfast in China. The cost was 340rmb for 2. This is how much I paid for a room at the Crowne Plaza (nicer hotel) including 2 breakfasts a few days later in Changsha!!! If you must stay at this hotel, cross the street and go to Starbucks. Nov 14 2018	Nice place to stay	Stayed at this hotel as part of a Pacific Delights tour. It had the best food of any hotel on the tour. Nice rooms, but the hotel looks a little dated. Overall a very nice experience. Aug 2 2018	would never stay there again	The lobby of this hotel is the best thing it has going for it.The room I was in was old and grubby looking. The carpet was something that I never put my bare feet on. Mold in the bathroom.Hard beds. I asked for an ironing board and the one they sent had a large whole right through the pad.Great breakfasts and they should be for $25 CDN.Stay away from the pizzas. Poor location near the stadium although the subway is right outside the hotel doo.Across the road is a outlet mall with a lot of knock off type storesbut does have a drugstore.This hotel was part of a package tour deal. Mar 30 2018 	Good Strategic Location	Intro- After staying at a couple of hotels more centrally placed (ie next to Yanan Road), I realized i needed one closer to the factory where I visit during my trips located in the zone South of Shanghai.Location and Logistics- This hotel is situated in the South of the main city. It is literally opposite the Shanghai Stadium Complex and at the side of IKEA. It is also a short cab ride down to Xui Jia Huai Shopping Mall intersection (5-6 Malls).- It's next to a couple of Metro Connections which should take you easily to other parts of the city. Taxis are abundant. It is also less tedious for people to reach this hotel from Pudong Airport as its on a road linked to roads leading from Nanpu and Lupu bridges. Rooms and Design- I was in a Superior Room, which means the most basic. The room was very clean, there were no odours and it was equipped with stuff like safe, kettle etc Hot water available.- I'm not N American or European so I find that the the &quot;Stiffer&quot; and non-fluffy bed mattresses are an Asian default thing. Hence I found them not hard or too soft either.- The interior design of the room was standard and was not outdated as many people complained here. It didn't have that &quot;shine&quot; to it but it was not even close to shabby. - The views are of 2 types. I got the view from the back of the hotel which faces a huge empty ground surrounded by a concrete jungle (ie nothing to write home about). The view on the other side of this &quot;S&quot; shaped hotel is very good - facing the amazing stadia complex and couple of interesting buildings.- The lounge, lobby,hotel restaurant, check-in counters are some of the best and grandest I've seen in Asia. Very glittery and eye-catching. The interesting elevator hall lobby is quite nice with 10 super fast elevators available 24hrs.Service/Safety- All my requests over the phone or the counter were met very quickly and quite efficiently. The English language levels are as in most other 5-star hotels here - &quot;getting there&quot;.- As all 5-Star Hotels in Shg, the place is heavily secured with lots of staff and cams. You do have to fend off a couple of pimps once you exit the hotel's compound outside - just walk on and there wont be any problem. Amenities- Since it was winter, I didn't check out these but the breakfast buffet was really good. - A nice 24-Hour Deli serves some good quality bakery items and coffee.- Just outside the hotel (in its corner compound) is a 24 Hour mini-mart useful for buying stuff which costs a lot more in your room fridge.Opinion/Pros/Cons- If you are a busy business traveler whose main job is to visit the industrial zone/offices in the South, this is perfect hotel. In the evening, with less, traffic, once can easily hit Pudong in a taxi.- It is very close to eating places and the Xui jia Huai Shopping Complexes.- If you are lucky, you might catch a concert at the Stadia complex which hosts international acts throughout the year (It was Harry Connick Jr, Celine Dion and Maroon 5 when I was there.)- If you on a romantic holiday or short site seeing trip, this hotel is not very central or ideal to explore Shanghai. Cheers Feb 25 2018 	Not the best but...	I have stayed here a couple of times and, OK, behind the shining foyer the hotel is getting a bit run down but the service has been as good as I have found in the Peoples Republic of China. The rooms are faded but comfortable, and the buffet is good throughout the day, particularly for breakfast. At the price, it is above average. Tourists may want a more central location but the metro is fast, efficient, cheap and just outside the hotel. I'll be back... Jan 1 2018 	Nice hotel	We really enjoyed our stay here and found it to be good value for money. The room was spacious and clean, and the beds were comfortable. We were on the 11th floor which had good views of the city. The indoor swimming pool and sauna were good and the staff were helpful. Our only concern was that the location isn't too central but there's a metro station just outside and it was easy to get around the city using this, or by taxi which is cheap. The hotel restaurants were quite expensive so we used the local restaurants and cafes near by instead. The hotel is popular with business people and international tourists. Overall it was a great stay and we felt it offered good value for money. Nov 18 2007	Happy with Hua Ting Hotel and Towers	We were part of a Pacific Delight Tours group and this was the first hotel on the 13 day itinerary. Our stay was brief as we arrived late on a Friday evening, went touring all day Saturday and checked out early Sunday morning.Two Shanghai stadiums are across the way including the venue for the 2018 Olympic (Women's I think) soccer.We were quite pleased with the property overall. We had non-smoking and recently remodeled rooms on the 14th floor. The rooms featured a large 32&quot; LCD TV, good lighting, ethernet port (did not have time to use), nice bath lotions etc. Fitness room was great as well as the indoor pool, sauna and hot tub.Very good breakfast buffet with a good selection of Western as well as Asian menu items.The center of town can be easily reached by subway or a 25-30 minute cab ride away.By the way, there's a nice department store across the road called Foxtown. If you are hungry go to the basment level for the food court and you will find about 10 different inexpensive food venues. We had a dinner for four around $10 US! There's also a McDonald's in there as well as a Papa John's.Wish we had a chance to stay there longer. Maybe next time. Aug 15 2007	Called 5 star but I don't think so	This was our final stop on our &quot;Return to China&quot; tour before heading to Hong Kong. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby is quite lovely as are the common areas on the floors. But this is where the 5 star rating ended as far as I'm concerned. My daughter and I were traveling with friends on a group tour so we had adjoining rooms. It was quite obvious that the adjoining doors had not been opened in a very, very long time as the area between the doors was filthy!! I understand stains and such in hotels but this was just filth and the staff had opened the doors so unless they were blind, they just didn't care. Mold was also a problem in the bathroom but the thing that grossed me out the worse was when we used the bathrobes they provided. I assumed when I put the robe on that it was clean. After having it on for a minute or two, I couldn't seem to get the scent of men's cologne out of my head. I finally realized it was coming from the robe!! Obviously the guest before us had used the robe too, hung it up and housekeeping never changed them out!! Needless to say, I called the manager about this who seemed totally unconcerned and unable to understand my discomfort. I asked that housekeeping bring 4 clean robes to our 2 rooms and took another shower in our moldy bathroom. The spa and pool areas are quite nice (and mold free) but the hotel as a whole caters much more to the business crowd then to a group like ours. So when we went for a swim and even though we were the only ones in the pool, the attendant kept coming in looking annoyed. In fact, out of every hotel we stayed in on our trip, the staff at this hotel was the least friendly and the least helpful. The hotel does have a very extensive breakfast buffet that was excellent. We also had lunch at the small cafe in the lobby but it was very over priced and not very good. And again, they are definitely used to catering to the business crowd as the menu choices were not very child friendly. I'm sure the tour company we were with uses this hotel because the time the group is in Shanghai falls on the weekend and conferences and such are not going on. It just happened that we changed our itinerary to get an extra day in Shanghai and ended up arriving there on a Friday while the rest of the group arrived the next day. The location is very far from the Bund and the Yuyuan gardens but since we were on a tour, this didn't matter much as transportation was taken care of. It just took a long time to get anywhere. There is a Quik-Mart right outside the hotel and a small grocery store just down the street so we were able to get drinks and snacks for the kids. And tucked back behind the stores, amongst the construction that is going on all around the hotel, there is a wonderful little resturant we went to called Xiao Ting. Walk out the front door, take a left and it's a little house that looks like it doesn't belong ther and it was absolutely wonderful!! That was our last dinner with some of the people from our group and so very close to the hotel! Jul 20 2007 	Nice Hotel so-so location	We stayed here on a Pacific Delight tour. The hotel was nice, probably the best of the bunch in the tour. The only gripe I had was the hotel location - it was always a 15-30 min cab ride to anywhere; good thing the cabs are so cheap in China! Good stuff: Great breakfast, there is a nice Dim Sum place next to this. There is a quick mart for stuff a lot cheaper than the mini bar just outside the door. There is a subway stop just outside, there is a bus station for day trips just outside. The room and comfort. Staff.Bad stuff: location, location, location. It is far from Bund, YuYuan gardens, Quipo Lu (shopping), and almost everything else. If this were closer, it would be a great place to stay for cheap (but then again it would cost more)... Jul 3 2007 	Good business and conference location	Good, large and clean. Large rooms. I wasnt able to check the fitness and spa area though. The breakfast buffet is opulent, from Asian noodles and dimsums to eggs in all variations. An all-night bistro provides pizzas and noodles, good to survive a conference. The lobby staff tends to be a little stressed and understaffed at most of the time. Queuing is likely here.You have to ignore the frequent girl traffic at night passing between lobby and the lifts. They wont bother you if you dont bother them. Cant judge acc. to price as I didnt pay the bill. May 3 2007 	Nice Hotel	I stayed at this hotel from 1st of April 2007 till the 4th of April to attend an exhibition at the &quot;Everbright center&quot; it was excellentlylocated next to the exhibiton (less than 10 min. with Taxi), I had a room at the executive floor, the room is so normal but with lovely view (floor 26), the staff at the executive floor are super excellent; so friendly so helpfull well trained to deal with businesstravellers, the room price include, wireless internet, coffee and teaat any time plus breakfast and snacks, and a business center &amp; dry clean, I bet it was worth paying the extra for executive floor. The only thing I missed was being able to walk around in the evenings without taking the underground or a Taxi, there's not much to do at this area (not so touristic like Nanjing) although there's some malls2 underground stations away, but Nanjing is much better..... Dec 21 2006 	Mold ruined my stay.	Hotel Guest from November 30 to December 5, 2006When your car pulls up to the luxurious looking Hua Ting Hotel &amp; Towers, you think you have made an excellent choice for an incredibly reasonable price. The lobby is bustling with international travellers.......the marble floors are glistening and the water fountains are dancing.....definitely a 5 star feeling on the first floor. When you check in to your room, your heart will sink because you will find a bathroom that has black mold everywhere. The rooms have seen better days.......they have all the necessities, but are showing signs of wear. The 2 rooms I experienced (I requested a room change due to too much mold and overheating) were unacceptable. I am sure the carpets have never been cleaned!!! I have travelled all over the world and have stayed in all levels of hotels. I have never experienced such incongruities in presentation..........outside your room the hotel is palatial and spotlessly clean....inside your room you want to call the health officials!!! This is not just my bad luck. I spoke with several other hotel guests during my stay and they all complained of varying levels of mold and dirty carpets. Unfortunately for me, I am highly allergic to mold and during my stay my respiratory system was compromised. The buffet breakfast on the main floor is absolutely incredible.All the food is beautifully prepared and displayed....delicious!! The main bathroom off the lobby was spectacular.....if only I could have booked that room for my stay!I did speak with the concierge about the problems. I sent an email to the management of the hotel and a copy to the Preferred Hotel Group that has the Hua Ting within its group. I did receive a response from the director of Preferred Hotel Group and she said she would look into the problem. I would certainly call the hotel directly before committing to booking a room.Rosamund ParkinsonMontreal, Canada Sep 25 2006	Amazing Hotel!	This hotel was simply amazing! The rooms were immaculate, the beds were clean and comfortable and the breakfasts offered so much variety (both Chinese and Western style). I loved the location though... it is steps away from the metro, 711, and right across from the Fox outlet mall. I would definitely stay here again. We arrived at this hotel after being in a cramped room on the Princess Elaine for the 3 gorges tour. We felt like royalty!!! p.s. If you take the metro to go to the pedestrian shopping area, take the #1 and #2 but make sure you remember your entrance. If you don't, upon your return, you will have a long way to walk to get back to your hotel. Dec 13 2005	5 stars? I think not	Somehow, this hotel cannot count. It is nowhere near a 5 star International hotel. My initial room internet did not work, toilet did not work and aircon did not work. They moved me to another room where my aircon did not work. Food is average and very expensive. Unfortunately for this hotel, I am a very frequent traveller. They need to improve considerably to be able to classify themselves as 5 stars. Nov 15 2005	Good Hotel	Our room was large and comfortable. The bathroom was well-equipped and spotless (it could use a better ventilation system.)The buffet breakfast was excellent but the coffee machine was confusing for some people and led to occasional lines. We found the staff friendly and helpful. The Metro station is right outside the front door and you can be in the center of Shanghai in 15 minutes but if you like to get out and walk around a city a more central location would be a better choice. Oct 29 2005 	Mixed feeling	Hua Ting Hotel &amp; Towers used to be Sheraton but is now owned by a chinese group. Although the hotel is not the newest, the first impression is good, certainly not run down. Most impressive is the big elevator tower which always guarantees quick ascents and descents, also to the top floor restaurant.Its setting is, near Shanghai Stadium, is somewhat remote from the city center but an underground station is in front of the entrance. In no time you´re on Hengshan or Huahuai road. Not difficult to get a taxi either.On average the price for a room is lower than other 4-5 star hotels so it would have been a good deal. That is until a saw a cockroach emerging from under my bed cover just before a left my room for the last time! Probably an incident but not something to happen in an hotel of this stature. Will think twice to book again. Nov 13 2021 	?????????????? Oct 19 2021 	????????????????????? Oct 17 2021 	????? Sep 18 2021 	Una ciudad para volver Aug 14 2021 	????????????????

"Nov 24 2021 	Great room Great service Great City	My wife and I stayed here for a week in May 09. I used priority club points and received a nice suite upgrade due to my status. The room was very large, modern, clean and comfortable with lounge area, large desk and very soft bed. We were welcomed with fresh fruit and bottled water was supplied for us a couple of times a day. A bit noisy with the windows open, but high up and nice view of Pudong. The bathroom was also very nice. Large, clean, nice amenities. I highly recommend the club intercontinental upgrade that gives you access to the lounge on the top floor. There is a very nice breakfast buffet and menu. It's not extensive, but refined, fresh and more than adequate. There are always drinks and snacks to be had there after shopping, sightseeing etc. It's very reserved and businesslike, but we felt comfortable even though we were dressed casually for sightseeing/shopping.The service is very good and the staff is very well-trained. A bit formal, but if it does make you uncomfortable, it's nice. Everyone smiles and asks if you need anything.Front desk, door staff, concierge were all incredibly friendly and accomodating. If you ask for directions, advice, tips on how to get somewhere, you are almost overwhelmed with friendly response, but it was all welcome and comfortable. We were in search of the best dumplings and shopping and we got all kinds of interesting suggetions and help.We ate one night in the noodle restaurant and it was very good. Don't miss the tourist tunnel under the river!!! Nov 20 2021 	Great service helpful sightseeing advice and fantastic facilities!	The Intercontinental was the perfect hotel for us to stay. It was our first trip to China and we found everyone welcoming, helpful and the facilities were everything that we needed. Nov 17 2021 	Couldn't have asked for more	My stay at the Intercontinental was sensational. I was really happy with the service as nothing was too hard for staff and they went above and beyond. Rooms were spacious, really clean and quite plush as the amenities were superb. Room service food was great as well as the restaurant food. They have a really nice bar there also that was great to have a few drinks at and i also had a spa treatment that was relaxing and had a great ambiance. The location was perfect as it was close to some great shops and easy to get to major city centers. I Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay with great rates and value for money. Nov 10 2021 	Perfect Pudong Hotel	This Pudong hotel offers the business traveler (and a the leisure traveler) a great hotel experience. Big rooms. Some great friendly service. Great in room dining. Good club lounge. Good gym (thank god). Great spa. Great Pudong location. Close to the metro and great surrounding shopping.The ongoing argument - Pudi vs Pudong -- While i personally prefer the Puxi side, but If you decide to stay in Pudong -- then InterCon is the place to stay. Nov 1 2021 	Luxurious Rooms and Excellent Service	The InterContinental Shanghai Pudong was my home away from home for 5 nights during my recent and first time visit to Shanghai. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted with a smile from the friendly doorman and bell staff and throughout our stay the hotel staff were always available to assist and provide friendly, efficient service. We hadn't researched the city before we arrived so the Concierge staff were invaluable in recommending great shopping spots, restaurants and things to see and do. We stayed in a Premier Suite which was stylish, spacious, well appointed and had the most comfortable bed i have ever experienced in a hotel. The room also included an iPod docking station which was an added bonus. We enjoyed Club Lounge access which was superb and included hot made to order breakfast and complimentary evening drinks and canapes which featured superb wines and Moet on the menu.I can't wait to go back to Shanghai, it is vibrant city and i would definitely be staying again at the InterContinental Shanghai Pudong. Oct 28 2021 	Comfort 	We went to Shanghai for 2 nights during our tour through China and were booked in the Interconti Shanghai. This hotel was recommended by my German colleagues and now I am sure this was the right decision. The Intercontinental Shanghai Pudong lives up to its promise and you can feel home there. Comfortable rooms, huge spa area and swimmingpool + fitness center, qualified and polite staff and the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen. We had the chance to go into the Interconti Club Lounge and all the business people seemed to be satisfied and happy to stay in there and relax as well as the other leisure travelers we met in the bars. Join it! Oct 27 2021 	Fantastic place to stay	My friend and i stayed at the Intercontinental Shanghai in July 2021 and our experience was fantastic. The staff were friendly and always ready to assist in any way. Our room was great, very clean, furnished modernly and tastefully and the bathroom was amazing! We found the food to be delicious and also the wait staff beyond reproach. The Intercontinental is professionally run and beautifully managed and I would definitely stay again. Oct 26 2021 	Fantastic service and beautiful new rooms	The staff are very friendly and helpful especially since it was the first time in Shanghai and i couldn't speak manderin. The rooms were very modern as the hotel had been newly renovated. The hotel is in a good location as it is close to the mall and is short walk from the train station which makes it easier to get around. There is also a spa treatment place there which well worth a visit after a long day of walking around sight seeing. I will definitely stay there again.A++++ Oct 26 2021 	Perfect hotel for the Business Traveller	This hotel has excellent service and the management are eager to understand the needs of their clientelle in order to service their needs. The rooms are very clean,comfortable modern and spacious .The layout is excellent. The buffet is good value and the concierge and staff are eager to please. Oct 26 2021 	This Hotel is a must stay	The hotel has just had a refurbishment and the rooms are fantastic, great decor. It makes you feel your in a house not a Hotel room.The staff at this hotel are amazing, from the moment you are greated at the front door, all the way thru to check out.This is the first time I have felt enthused to write a review, I have stayed at quite a few hotels varying in quality and this hotel would be one of the best I have seen. Oct 6 2021 	A Great Hotel	We stayed there for 6 nights. The rooms are large &amp; well furnished. Breakfast is fabuluous. Staff were extremely helpful &amp; friendly to us. It is a very professionally run hotel, we could not fault it. Sep 18 2021 	Good hotel if the Pudong side of the Bund is good for you.	Spacious lobby, great breakfast buffet, nice Club lounge, good and caring staff.The IC Pudong is a modern hotel with all amenities. The IC Club offered a good selection of drinks and finger foods. Again, service was top notch.Bartender Jeffrey downstairs at the ibar knows his drinks, however the band palying this month is less than desireable.Rooms were spaceous, clean and modern (Club level). A good choice in Pudong. Aug 1 2021 	Nice hotel for the price	So this hotel is located in the Pudong district which is on the other side of the river from the main downtown area. It is close walking distance to the subways to get over to the main district. There are also attractions on this side such as the Oriental Pearl TV Tower......awesome. As for the hotel, the rooms were very nice and quiet. Pillows were very nice too. The restaurants were OK although a bit pricey which I guess is to be expected for a 5 star hotel. Anyways, I would stay here again and enjoyed the stay. Jul 14 2021 	OK but...	Well, the facade is nice, the location spot on. (although you will still need a taxi everywhere). The staff are extremely helpful, and the decor is attractive. The bar is comforting, with pool table, and one night, they had a covers band playing to a very high standard. Be warned, the prices are expensive!The food was amazing - I went back for more each time.The rooms however, are a disappointment. The plug on my bath came out, and the workmanship of the bath left a lot to be desired.Having said that, the hotel overall was outstanding. Jun 18 2021 	Business hotel on a luxury side.	We chose this hotel to be in a more quiet Pudong area in our last two days in Shanghai. It was additional US$100 a night to upgrade to the club level, but definitely well worth it. The club level upgrade included a renovated room, an afternoon tea (the desserts there are to die for!), free drinks on the club level for happy hour and buffet breakfast. That was the best buffet breakfast I have ever had in my life! The renovated rooms are very nice with good entertainment system, spacious bathroom and big windows. We really enjoyed the room!The concierge guy was very helpful. He got us tickets to Era circus and also provided us with all maps and directions to various locations.The rest of the staff was very cold. Since this is a business hotel (and you will feel a bit out of place as a tourist there), they have more reserved way of communicating. Not friendly at all.There is really not too much to do around the hotel. However, the subway is close by. We found a good restaurant in a mall across the road (not sure what’s the name of the mall, but it has all major brand names such as H&amp;M etc) The restaurant is on the third floor – you have to take the elevator – and is called South Memory (very trendy and the food is very good and reasonably priced). Jun 17 2021 	love your new rooms	this is my second visit to this hotel and wow the new rooms are amazing. I paid the same rate as last year but for a better room! Club lounge service is very personalized, especially the butler service when you stay in the cliub lounge room. Silar the club lounge butler helped me whenever I needed him. The food in the Club lounge is also a very high quality and they dont go tight on the food and drinks like other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. I will come back, new rooms are large, clean and love the plasmas. Only thing they need to work on, and I told them, is working better with the local drivers to increase their understanding of English. Jun 17 2021 	Good choice	Hotel is good, american style top 4 star..not a 5 star but close. gym is good enough with lots of treadmills. lots of shopping and eating all around the hotel. but remember the hotel is in pudong which is the newer business part of shanghai so you need to take a cab across the river to get to the more touristy older parts like the French Concession (great pedestrian area with excellent restauarants). That being said, cabs in China are dirt cheap (go for the green, white or yellow coloured cabs, stay away from red ones and other ones as much more expensive...ie $10 instead of $6 sorta amount). The breakfast buffet here is the best I've ever had....way better than anyone I've been to in Vegas. Fantastic...love dumplings in the morning. Jun 10 2021 	Consistant hospitality	This was the third time I stayed at this hotel. Right from the reception to concieage it was very pleasant experience. Hotel is conveniently located and the suite I stayed was qute good. Being Indian I only used their resturent for breakfast and the near by &quot;India Kitchen&quot; for other meals. May 26 2021 	Shop Around - Probably Better Values in this Area	I have been traveling to China twice a year for the last 5 years, and have stayed in many different hotels in the Shanghai area. This was my first time at this particular property, and absolutely plan to shop around before staying here again. The hotel lobby was nice, but had a strong/stale cigarette odor. While checking in, the front desk seemed more interested in up-selling rooms and services, than making me feel welcome. Finally after not understanding all the option, I ask simply for the lowest cost option available. My room was on the 20th floor and was really small and the décor dated. The carpets were stained, and the bathroom was only equipped with the basic essentials. The cab from the airport took about 45 minutes and cost 140 Yuan, without traffic. With traffic, I’ve heard the time can double. I had to try for over 20 minutes to place an order for room service (either they were understaffed, or just really busy when I called). Overall, not my best hotel experience in China. Apr 9 2021	Excellent hotel friendly staff great beds and food	I recently stayed at this hotel and was very pleased We had a lovely room and the breakfasts and buffet dinners were the best we experienced in four cities in China Overall we had a great holiday to a fascinating country Apr 5 2021 	A great place to stay..	First class service, great rooms, fantastic food and very friendly staff. Mar 1 2021 	Very good option in Shangai	I stayed in Intercontinental Pudong more than 10 times already. It is not the prettiest or newest hotel in Shanghai but very convenient. The staff is professional, the location is good, rooms are sufficient, Room-Service and Breakfast Buffet is very good. Great business hotel. Jan 29 2021 	WOW My re-visit was perfect.	This is my umpteenth stay at the IC in Pudong, and this time they got it perfect. My last visit was over 9 months ago, and have things ever changed.My unpronouncable last (family) name was said correctly the first time at check in. My upgrade was configured the way I liked it with twin beds in a normally king-size-bed room. The assistant manager came out to greet me, as he remembered me from my critical comments to him last time. And on and on and on. I have reviewed this hotel going back three years, and I have had plenty of near-miss stays before. The carpets and TVs are new, and I was told they are still going to renovate this room once more very shortly. It was fine as is, but the modern design of the new club rooms will go throughout the hotel, see another reviews on those. The front desk was cordial every time, every workshift.. Shanghai's finest breakfast buffet retained the honor easily with the copious variety of western, Chinese, Japanese and just plain fabulous international dishes. I especially like the freshly pressed watermelon juice mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice. You get the idea. The room features what appear at first to be soft beds, but then again they provided the right amount of support. The furnishings, amenities and little things were all there. The place was spotless, including the new carpeting. No hint of smoking, either, another great bonus for a Chinese hotel.The only area for improvement is a common one in 99% of hotels. The reading lights next to the bed are a bit dim. I actually brought my own 20-watt, 220-volt flourescent bulb, so I did not have to ask for higher wattage. (This was a longer China stay at several hotels, so my $5 investment pays off.) And a word about the taxis who are stationed there. They are of the highest quality. But do not be confused with those who drive up to let off passengers and then pick up hotel guests. You might not get the same honest quality drivers you get from the taxi stand at the hotel. So ask the doorman for one of the hotel's taxis, not a drive-up, drop-off one. They cost the same as all taxis, by the meter.No doubt about it this time. The IC team made the effort and it shows. Jan 7 2021 	Great Hotel	Great hotel. Nice new renovated room. breakfast, staff Jul 14 2008 	the first also the last time we will visit this property- 1 start rating at most	My husband and I booked the hotel via intercontinental.com online @ the last minutes, just 24 hours before the trip - being the ambassador member of the hotel chain- and esp after a fabulous stay at intercontinental Beijing (finance street) - it should be safe to stay with the same hotel chain. The experience turned out to be disastrous - we arrived at nearly mid-night due to 3 hours flight delay - needless to say a warm welcome from staff - the front desk was rude, and ignorant - as if they only wish we go away as soon as possible - needless to mention any start hotel staff should bear, the basis coourtesy and knowledge. The hotel hallway was ingeneral hot (due to renovation somehow, with bad smell and poor ventilation - the whole facility was poorly maintened. Needless mentioning of the room, it smells stale and dusty. worst than a one star hotel. Next morning we tried the complimentary breafast-as it's included in the package, the onlything we noticed, was poorly managed staff and facilaty - with all the disappointments, we decided to check out a day ealier - and moved to much cleaner and friendlier St Regis Shanghai with 24hr butler service to each room- we were at last satisfied, at ease with our choice. Apr 24 2008 	Intercontinental Old Elegance	I've stayed at the Intercontinental Shanghai Pudong many times. This was the first time I have stayed there in a few years, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But it is the same ol' Intercontinental.The check-in was swift and efficient. We upgraded to Club Rooms for a little more in price. this gave us free internet access (normally US$30 per day) and free breakfast and happy hour snacks and drinks on the top floor.The rooms were nice--not overwhelming, but spacious and comfortable. The large desk was welcome and the bathroom was spacious, as always. It was a little difficult to get the room to the correct temperature, though. It was either too hot or too cold. That is a common occurrence and I didn't find it overly annoying. The people were always gracious and willing to help out. I remembered to tip the housekeeping staff every day. They really do an excellent job. Outside of the hotel on the final day, I ran into Ken, a former doorman at the Hotel. He remembered me from years ago and inquired about my co-workers with a memory that astounded me. He now works in kitchen sales at the Intercontinental, but still took time to greet me as if I was the most treasured guest. Breakfast upstairs is great. You have a small buffet and a set menu you cna order from. I enjoyed the fresh grapefruit juice every morning. One morning, they didn't have grapefruit juice, but I was told when I arrived that they were busy squeezing me a glass in the kitchen because they knew how much I enjoyed it. The buffet in the regular dining room is wonderful. We ate there for dinner twice and found it to be everythign you could wish for in a meal. The people are gracious and please note that the servers will let you keep the table as long as you want without bringing you a bill. They will bring it when asked, but they don't want to rush you.On my last evening at the Hotel, I received a 300RMB coupon for the spa. Ah-ha! They didn't realize I had a late flight the next day, so I used it for 300RMB off of a 350RMB foot massage. Great spa. Very calming. They also had a special for the Club rooms where you could buy one treatment and get a second 1/2 off. I didn't know about this until I entered the spa, though, so I didn't take advantage of it. I usually get my Chinese massages at blindman massage--cheaper ($21 for 3 hours) and more therapeutic (less like a spa, more like a health clinic). But the I-Spa is very nice for a spa experience in Shanghai. All in all, my stay at the Intercontinental was wonderful. I'd go again. And again. And again.... Apr 8 2008 	great place to stay across the river from the bund	we stayed here for business for almost two weeks. should have spent the extra to upgrade. the room was very nice (other then draft from stairwell door they kept leaving open that was right next to our door- made the room rather chilly). the resturant had everything you would have wanted - the pastry counter did leave something to be desired, we americans do like our sugar :)great staffnew spa Dec 16 2007 	Losing its top rating	Have stayed here about three times a year since it opened. This most recent stay was a disappointment. The hotel lost power three nights in a row in the middle of the night. Coming from the US, you are awake in the middle of the night so quickly looked outside to see if it was just the hotel or more. It was just the hotel. On the third night, there was a letter on the night table to say that power would be off for half an hour. Supposedly there is a back up generator but it didn't kick in so the halls, everything was very dark. The breakfast buffet is still great but we had to ask for our coffee more than once and waiters seem to care less than in the past. Maybe it is a training issue due to turnover from people going to better hotels. Other food order for dinner was good as well but service was less than in the past. Also, there was mildew in the tile in the shower that has started to smell bad. These are things that can be fixed but need attention quickly. We are considering other options for future stays. The location is great for tunnel access to the Puxi side but the issues need to get addressed. Sep 4 2007 	Pretty Good Hotel	I've visited the hotel several times, mostly for the wonderful buffet dinner at the hotel...It is amazing, perhaps the only good food I find in China in my 3 trips there annually. Finally found a decent rate there (It was about RMB1000/night versus the usual RMB1500 that I usually see). The room was clean, bathroom was spacious...But the decor seemed a little dated. I paid an extra RMB400/night for the club level which got breakfast, afternoon tea (which I never did partake in), and evening cocktails with hot appetizers--which became my dinner nightly--the food was more than sufficient for a meal. The service at the hotel is top-notch, friendly from the bellhops to the maids, and the Club Level attendants are not stingy with the drinks...Good selection of booze, beer and wine. Definitely worth RMB1400 a night for my all-meal option, but wouldn't have paid more. I will stay here again. May 31 2007 	Beg to differ	I'm not sure why but my experience differed greatly from those below.I certainly didn't get the English speaking taxi service and on 3 different occaisions had to call the hotel whilst driving around Shanghai in circles to get the receptionist to explain to the driver and as for the concierge calling us by name, mmmm, not me. I actually found the staff quite sullen and this Hotel could learn a few things from its smaller sister in Beijing, The Holiday Inn Central, a brilliant Hotel where I was treated like a princess and felt as though I had come home. The Buffet was great and thier new Guest Relations manager was too, he , in my opinion, has a job on his hands. May 17 2007 	No Complaints in Pudong	Stayed for seven days. We upgraded to the club level to have access to meeting rooms and free breakfast and happy hour (only 200 RMB upcharge per night). Being a group of six with reports to write every night -- we enjoyed the happy hour and tasty treats (on two nights, this constituted dinner), supported by a wireless connection. Room was nice sized, bath was too. It was quiet and bed was comfortable.Breakfast on the club level required sharp sight. The various offerings were often in nice glassware on the shelves -- my blurry eyes missed much of it on day 1. You can order a hot breakfast (again, I missed this on day 1 -- I joined a colleague on day 2 and out came a fresh waffle!). Happy hour (5:30 to 8:00) included some very nice offerings and they kept bringing out new treats. The restaurant lunch was good, a bit pricy. Dinner had the choice of a nice buffet (good value) or an ala carte menu. No one was dissatisfied with their meals -- no one really raved about them either. (Dinner one night, lunch twice.)The iBar in the lobby had a live band. There was a regular group of three women who went to tables where men were sitting alone or in small groups .... Our table was never approached, but that could be because I was there (female). Dec 25 2006 	Excellent Concierge	Stayed on the Club floor and was upgraded to a suite which was enormous. The Concierge Desk at this hotel is very well organised, and friendly.I would stay here again. Jan 19 2006	The best Banana Bread in the world!	This may be a strange review but I must mention the fact that this hotel has the most amazing Banana Bread I have ever tasted. It can be purchased from their restaurant on the ground level. You must try it even if you don't stay at the hotel. Trust me, it's so good. Jul 27 2005 	Great hotel but shows its age	Stayed here 3 times during the past year, once for two weeks. Good points: beautiful lobby and atrium with glass elevators, live classical music, and an air of elegance. Highly competent, professional staff are friendly, helpful, and work hard to make your stay memorable. Spectacular breakfast buffet has almost every item imaginable, all of uniformly excellent quality. I haven't seen a more impressive spread in all my extensive travels through Asia. Well-equipped gym and pool are open 24 hours (great for jet lag, when you wake up at 3:00 A.M. and can't get back to sleep). Great location, just 5 minutes from the subway and huge department store. Weak points: Rooms are spacious but fixtures and furnishings are tired and need replacement. Stayed twice in an executive suite, which was huge. Regular rooms are very average, with aging bath fixtures and worn carpet - definitely not up to 5 star standards. Nov 25 2021 	??????????? Oct 28 2021 	Goed maar niet goedkoop...

"Aug 17 2021 	Nice hotel	Ivy boutique hotel is lovely. Only problem we had was finding it after we got off the metro at jin'ang temple station. The hotel map made it look not so far away - however this map is not to scale!! Also others had said it was about 15min walk from the station...This is NOT true lol. The road the hotel is on is actually VERY long - as are the majority of roads in Shanghai! But after some disorientation in the rain and being very tired dragging luggage through the streets negotiating the traffic and other pedestrians. Took us around an hour in the end and we ended up doing a full circle! lol Didnt help that we didnt have nor could we remember the number of the building being 700-odd when we were at the 100-odd end of the road!!! Take a taxi! About 11Yuan within the area anyway. But anyhoo, hotel itself is quite nice. Passageways have quotes from films to add to the designer feel. A sitting area on our floor with clouds floating above and ornamental decor again added to this. The Ivy shows a movie each night on their big screen in the longe area - turned out to be the same move every night - Gone with the Wind - with no sound! Decor continues with the room theme...Rooms are nice, with coloured see-through screen separating the bedroom and bathroom! Little touches like the toiletries bag with many bits and pieces and the artwork on the wall. LAN connection for those who have laptops and wi-fin in the lobby area. Breakfast was a choice from chinese and american - some congee on the former and eggs and bacon from the latter. Coffee was goood! Staff very helpful and pleasant. Overall lovely hotel. Location could've been a little closer to the metro station but with taxi's being cheap its not that much of an issue. Just remember to carry the hotel card /address with you! Ivy could print a larger version to help the poor taxi drivers trying to read it in the dark! Jun 21 2021 	The Ivy Hotel - design gem in local Jing´an district	Since we hadn´t found any trustful reviews on `The Ivy Hotel` - a 46 room boutique hotel for business and leisure travellers in Shanghai´s upcoming Jing´an district - before our trip we were attracted by the hotel´s website and the appealing pictures of the rooms hidden behind an ivy-painted outside. Furthermore, we got a really got offer on a booking request on hrs - stay 5 nights/pay 4 nights/breakfast included - so we finally decided on The Ivy.To my surprise early check-in on the arrival day at around 9:30 a.m. after a 10 hours uncomfortable economy flight was not a big thing for the friendly English-speaking staff at the stylish reception below a huge chandelier. The premises were modern and, most important, clean, calm, comfy, and air-conditioned (outside in those early morning hours --&gt; temp. 32 degrees Celsius, wow). Furthermore, bathing and beauty goodies, slippers, safety box, mini bar, bottled water for free awaited us in our tasteful furnished platinum/premier room (twin beds, flat screen, marble bathroom w/ bathtub and a separate shower). Besides, The Ivy offers free parking, ironing service and further services like personal butler upon request.The breakfast was a bit ´basic` - offering a chinese style breakfast (fried noodles, wan tan soup, etc.) or american style breakfast (toast, jam, oatmeal, muesli/cereals, omelette, or eggs in any type) w/ tea or coffee/orange juice. Nevertheless, it was ok being included in our booking (separate price: 60rmb). Unfortunately, we didn´t have time to have dinner in the restaurant but it seemed to attracted both, locals and tourists. As far as I remember, a three-course meal was offered for 158 rmb.The staff was absolutely helpful and friendly when dealing with our requests, for e.g., researching train departures, opening hours, taxi, etc.The Ivy´s location is approx. a 10 min. walk from Jing´an temple and the metro station (line 2). A metro station at the next junction (Jiazhou Rd./Changping Rd.) is under construction (finshed by 2020/2012?!) All in all, The Ivy an be a great deal and a very, very comfy ´base camp´ with cordial staff for your visit to Shanghai!!!"
"Jun 27 2021	Was treated like dirt when we complained about being stolen	My family and I stayed at the Jianguo Hotel in Shanghai. On June 15, 2021 my sister noticed her makeup kit was missing, My nephew noticed that his eye contact solution was also missing. 8 of my fish cloisonne were also missing. We did bring this up to the front desk. They did come to our room immedately. They took a statement from us and them promptly called us back an hour later to tell us that they contacted the maid and her manager and said that they did not believe she did it. I would not recommed this hotel. I also learned that if I would have called the police that they would have made the hotel reimburse us for the stolen items. Jun 17 2021	Great hotel - great location	This hotel is really good - in a great location, the staff were friendly and efficient. Room was good - as was the shower. Breakfast was very good, food was hot. Jun 15 2021 	Average business hotel	Stayed at the Jianguo hotel for one night before travelling to Wuhan. Overall pretty standard business hotel. Rooms were normal size and had everything that was needed. Breakfast was good with a varied selection. Hotel location is ok with easy access to the Shanghai metro to get around. Staff were helpful anf looked after our bags for a couple of hours when we checked ut early. Aug 17 2018	First Class Hotel...	Enjoyed our stay here for two nights. The food was excellent and breakfast was superb with fantastic choice (including bottles of mineral water). Didn't have time to try the swimming pool unfortuately. The lobby toilets were immaculate however bizarrely had partial frosted glass between the cubicles and on the doors -a little off-putting to say the least!Rooms were of a good standard and very clean. Would definitely recommend this. Jul 15 2018 	Nice clean business hotel	The Jianguo is a nice and clean 4-star (by Chinese standards) hotel. The rooms were big enough, with a comfortable king size bed, a couch and a desk. The staff was very friendly and it was never a problem getting cards written in Chinese from the concierge to let the taxi driver know where to take me. The breakfast here is also outstanding, with a mix of foods to make anyone from North America, Europe or Asia happy.The location of the hotel is just ok. It was convenient for my business meetings and is close to the football/soccer stadium. A taxi ride to the French Concession wasn't too bad, but a ride to the Bund in Shanghai traffic took a long time. Apr 13 2018 	Small room by good price	Stayed at the Jianguo for three days on business. Hotel was well priced, but found it did not really live up to its 4 star claim. Rooms were clean and in good repair, but showed their age. Also the rooms were quite small, especially the bathroom. Room was quiet.Service was good - but like other reviewers I was followed off the elevator and propositioned for a 'massage' while I was walking to my room. Breakfast buffet was OK. Hotel location was central, and for its price I'd stay here again, just my expectations would be set lower on the 'luxury' front. Feb 25 2018 	Very Good Business Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for a total of 9 nights while in Shanghai. The service and cleanliness was excellent. The food was above par at the morning and evening buffet. It is conveniently located to several large shopping areas, and about a 30 min cab ride to the downtown and Bund areas. If your location of business is close by you can't do better, but if you are here as a tourist you are far from the action.The beds were a bit hard, but I am comparing them to US hotels. The bathroom had a nice hot shower, and great water pressure. The high speed access made it easy to do my work.All in all a very good business hotel. Feb 20 2018 	Good and reasonable clean hotel	I have been to a few hotels in the Shanghai area but this one was one of the better ones for location and cost!I booked it through asiarooms and the price was MUCh cheaper than booking the hotel direct.I had a room on the executive floor that gave you benefits such as free internet, a fully digital room so the tv also doubled as a HUGE computer, a separate floor for breakfast - where you could get both western and local foods, a happy hour (!)Room was clean, large and comfy with a fruit basket each day.The only negative thing I can say was the bed was quite hard but this is a Chinese 'thing'!Will defianlty stay again!! Jan 29 2018	Nice hotel the prostitutes in the foyer were a worry though	I won't bother going in to too much detail about the facilties, staff etc: My room was small but nice, Internet access handy and daily breakfast very nice. Concierge very helpful with writing cards in Chinese to give to taxi drivers.What did concern me, and I have no idea how it is in other hotels, was the number of requests for &quot;massages&quot; I and other members of our travelling party received. Also, one evening when we returned to the hotel there were 3 prostitutes standing by the elevators on the ground floor looking for business. (It took me a while to realise that the women standing around in some bars and on street corners in some parts of China are in fact selling themselves.... Call me niave!)It would be nice to think that, even if this does go on at every business grade hotel in China, it's something that's not condoned by management and that the &quot;procurement&quot; of such services could go on elsewhere.... Aug 3 2017 	Reasonably priced central Hotel	Stayed in the Jianguo for a couple of nights over the weekend whilst on business. The Hotel appears to be fairly open &amp; modern in the main areas; lobby &amp; restaurants but I found my bedroom to be pretty small, old fashioned &amp; a bit claustrophobic. However, it was clean &amp; had internet access. On my first evening I ate in the Itoya Japanese restaurant. For me personally the menu was fairly restricted but I did enjoy what I ordered. On the second night I ate in the Sunflower court. I opted to order from the menu &amp; the meal was acceptable, but I wished I had gone for the buffet as the selection seemed to be really good. I didn't go for breakfast &amp; ate lunch in the food court of one of the nearby department stores, which had plenty of choice &amp; was very cheap.The location of the Hotel was very much a positive. It was quiet enough in the evenings, but only a 5/10 minute walk to the shopping district.Would recommend the Hotel for a short stay if you don't mind fairly cramped conditions in your room. The room provided decent value for money. Aug 23 2016 	Very clean and comfortable	We stayed in this hotel as part of our Kuoni tour of China. Some structural work was being undertaken, scaffolding was being erected while we were there. We received fruit and free drinks as compensation for this but we were not inconvenienced at all. The room on the 15th floor was clean and very comfortable with all the expected facilities. Breakfast was good with lots of choice. Mar 6 2016 	Great Place	I have stayed at this Hotel several times while in Shanghai. Rooms are very clean and well appointed. The executive floors have their own lounge on the 23rd. floor. Great view, and relaxing atmosphere. A better breakfast is served when staying on the exec. floors. There is shopping nearby, and there is a huge Catholic Cathedral directly across the street. It is approx 40 mins. to the airport. You can arrange for the hotel to pick you up at the airport. They will be waiting for you with a sign. I highly recommend this hotel. May 17 2015	Nice place!	We stayed at this hotel for 1 week. It is an international hotel, with a caring staff. The breakfast buffet is geared towards all nationalities. Rooms are spacious and clean. Rooms have a safe in them. Walking distance to shopping, bank, restaurants &amp; subway. Hotel has restaurants, hair salon/barber, business center, pool, etc. Concierge staff to arrange sightseeing or other amenities. We felt very safe in this area. I liked the fact that you could open the windows if you wish, too. Jul 27 2021 	????????????? Apr 27 2021 	Für Geschäftsreisende ideal--- Feb 28 2021 	???????????

"Oct 31 2021 	Just Reasonable	From outside it looks like it is a new hotel but it actually is a old hotel. Some rooms have been recently refurnished. However, I did not very much like it. I wouldn't call it 5* quality at all.The best thing is its revolving restaurant on 41st floor which lets you have a good view of the city. However, service in that restaurant is not up to the mark. Aug 5 2021 	Service was surprisingly good for a Chinese-run hotel	My husband and 1-yr old baby stayed overnight here for our friend's wedding, which was at this same hotel. The overall facility and our room were clean, comfortable and nice. Maybe because our expectations for a Chinese hotel weren't that high, we ended up really enjoying our stay. First off, we didn't have to remind them to bring in the baby crib (they brought it into the room promptly). Even with the crib there was still plenty of room, and ours was just the standard room (it was called Superior). Since I can speak Chinese, I'm not sure how the staff's English level is. But what really impressed us was, the hotel was very efficient in finding the things we left in the room after we checked out, AND mailed them out to our home address the same day (we paid for shipping of course). Maybe this kind of service is assumed as normal for a Western hotel, but for a Chinese hotel, I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting to wait for weeks for my stuff to be mailed out, if at all. Jun 8 2021 	Not bad	I read the other reviews and I found the hotel to be not bad at all.The first room we stayed in was ultra modern although a bit small; 42&quot; plasma TV, good bed, etc; one problem: the wall separating the bathroom from the rest of the room was all glass. That rules out visitors, to say the least.In the room we found a coffee maker, a small fridge, cups and saucers, some cutlery, etc.After the cruise we stayed in a different older room that was actually much better; needed some paint, but it was larger, and had a more traditional bathroom.We liked the buffet for dinner and the food in the lobby; there is a small gift shop where one can buy water and other drinks, though the hotel supplies two free bottles of water a day, as do most other hotels.Everybody was actually very helpful, although English was definitely not fluently spoken; but they did try and we managed. The concierge was, however, a bit useless.The location was adequate, though personally I would have preferred a more central location, near the pedestrian mall or the Yu Yuan Gardens. We found our best souvenirs in the small towns during the river cruise. I don't think the shopping in Shanghai is as great as everybody makes it sound.We did experience the unrelenting noise from the construction site nearby; this is all over Shanghai now, since they are preparing for the World Expo next year. The Bund, for instance, is a mess.All in all, it was a pleasant experience, though next time I would go for the J.W. Marriott's better location. May 16 2021 	Good Location	Jin Jiang was my last stop. I had finished all my Business meetings and wanted to stay in a good shopping area for 2 days. The Rooms were lovely, tariff not too bad, but the staff was extremely cold and tried to charge for the complimentary water to discourage me from asking for water - since I do require more than a couple of small bottles a day! The massage parlour staff, too, forced a big tip out of me. The good thing about this Hotel is that there are a lot of good shopping places close by. The Buddha Jade Temple is also not too far off. Lots of nice restaurants around to chose from. Apr 6 2021 	Bad Hotel	I stayed a total of 22 nights in March/April and 20 nights February which is more than enough to give an opinion.The first time I stayed in the standard rooms on the lower floor, the rooms themselves were bright and modern, the cleanliness was good on moving in but after that depending on the cleaner was hit and miss.Second time of staying, I upgraded to the executive rooms floor 35 which for a few extra £'s is a better deal.Bad points: If you want piece and quite this is not the hotel for you, granted when moving in there was a letter on my desk saying they were carrying out some works in the day, ok not a problem. What they don't tell you is they don't care what time of day they start or finish. The drilling was so laud I could not hear my TV, if you want the noise to stop you have to complain. The first time I had to complain was when I got back from work at 8.30pm and the drilling and noise was still underway. The second time of complaining was at 07.30am, this hotel doesn't give a dam about their guests.The rooms give the impression that you can adjust the air co but as I found out that is not the case. When I asked about the room temp I was advised to move rooms which I did but did not solve the problem. The room temp is fixed centrally; my room was between 26 &amp; 28 very uncomfortable. You can't leave the windows open because of noise.The food in the hotel is very poor indeed, from the revolving restaurant to room service.There are far better hotels in Shanghai and I wouldn't stay here again.It also gets tire some when coming back from work later in the evening to be joined in the elevator by free lance prostitutes offering their services. Outside the main door of the hotel, they allow street traders to hassle you to buy knock off merchandise, myself and other guests complained several times and the problem for now has gone away. I stay in hotels 9 to 10 months of the year around the world so I know how I like things to be when I’m paying. The first time of staying I didn’t have to suffer the noise the food was just as bad we there are plenty of places to eat outside. Mar 28 2021 	Don't Believe the Hype	Based on the appearance, the hotel seems quite nice. However, the shower leaked and the toilet kept running. Also, the Business Center was not a good deal. They charge RMB 3 per minute and the computer is super slow and outdated. What a great scam.If your Chinese is limited (like mine) don't expect to get too much help from the staff. Several of them didn't know how to help me say &quot;The Bund&quot; in Chinese - I believe the concierge misdirected us on 2 separate occasions. There are some very good restaurants within walking distance. Xintiandi and Nanjing Road are both fairly close by taxi (approx RMB 11-14). Mar 25 2021 	Overall very good Shanghai hotel	Pros: Location, newly renovated rooms, good serviceCons: Bad breakfast buffet: dry bread, horrible sushi. We checked in early, coming straight from the train from Bejing, and upgraded, so we could check in at 8.00 am. We were told, that there was a complimentary breakfast - for 1 person ... - so we went up and had the buffet - It was really not worth the money - and afterwards, we were told, that the offer did not apply to the day we checked in ... Had we known this, we would definately not have eaten there. But apart from this misunderstanding, the overall impression was good. Nice, new room and OK staff. The location in the French concession was very good. Jan 14 2021 	Great Hotel for Fashionistas	Jin Jiang Tower is at the center of Shanghaiboutique shopping. Within blocks there areclose to a thousand specialty clothing storeswith some great products and unbelievablepricing.That's about the only thing good about it.The place litterally &quot;stinks&quot;. The lobby andelevators have a putrid stench. Apparentlythe gardeners in the atrium don't maintainthe plants and the roots are rotting.Well that's not all that is rotten. The serviceis rotten too. The Jin Jiang Tower has the laziest and mostrude staff of any hotel in Puxi. The updated rooms have nice decor, the view is nice,location is great. Try to get a cab there. Good luck!Better go out and take your chance to flag down oneon Changle Lu. The doorman is too busy smokingcigarettes and yacking with his buddies.Better bring a cart with you, there aren't any bellboys in sight. Dec 3 2018	Pretty good - nicely renovated	I stayed here for two nights as part of a tour group. The hotel was certainly very nice especially the recently renovated rooms. The bed was very comfortable, the flat screen TV with many many channels, the bathroom was well stocked with amenities, and the room view was fantastic. The hotel is located in the older part of town with the nice grand olde Shanghai charm. Many upscale shops and restaurants within blocks, some just around the corner. With the room rate, it included breakfast in the top level rotating restaurant. The view was unmatched almost anywhere in Shanghai. There are over five food stations with one custom cooking chinese noodles, and one custom cooking eggs. Many many choices, including some dim sum. Do not forget about the swimming pool and the huge sauna on the sixth floor. The sauna has three fullsize heated pools, steam room, with full back scrub and massage services. I went there both nights to relax after long days of walking tour and shopping walks. There are two minor point I wish the hotel would consider improving. First and foremost, the internet connection fee was way too high, $180 rmb for an hour, Come on! Second is that the quality of staff may fluctuate. Although everyone was very friendly, I encountered two who just went through the motion. It is a little bit far from the bund. The choices was walk three long blocks and take subway two long station away, or a take a taxi costing about $25 rbm. However, we had so much fun shopping in the neighborhood, my shopping buddies did not see any need to go to the Nanking Road shopping area. One of them bought a new suit-case just to fill the clothing she bought. So if you have concerns of staying here, I would ignore all previous reviews regarding the outdatedness of this hotel. The renovation was wonderfully done and has transformed this hotel as one of my favorite in town. (mind you, I have stayed in two other Shanghia hotel before). Oct 7 2018 	Adequate hotel with good location	My friend and I stayed two days at Jinjiang Tower as part of the holiday package offered by our travel agency. The hotel isn't exactly five stars by international standard, but we have no major complaints. The hotel is conveniently located near Huaihai Road, with eateries such as Hong Kong Xinwang cafe and Bifengtang restaurant just round the corner. The nearest subway station - Shaanxi South is also only about 7 to ten minute walk. A cab ride to Xintiandi and major shopping district cost only about RMB 13-15. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the decor updated with a LCD TV - complete with premium international channels such as CNN, HBO, BBC, Deutsche Welle etc. Our only problem is with the wall-mounted hair dryer in the bathroom that we found awfully weak. Other than that, we had an overall comfortable stay at Jinjiang Tower and would consider staying there again. Jul 24 2018 	Great hotel great location - make sure you get an updated room	I had a lot of apprehension staying at this hotel. While it was the &quot;first five star hotel&quot; in shanghai, it certainly didnt appear to be what americans would consider 5 star (at least not anymore). however, the location and hotel rates were too good to ignore. as of june 2018, the rooms on the executive floor, while larger and coming with perks (free breakfast, internet etc), were not updated. my fiance had stayed there in january and march on the executive floor and found the rooms &quot;dated&quot;. to my pleasant surprise, when we arrived we were put into a very updated room (fairly modern). we got the deluxe king room on the 13th floor (34 sq meters)the room came with every possible bathroom amenity (shampoo, conditioner etc, toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, comb, cotton.... you really didnt need to bring anything). the room also came with two complimentary bottles of water daily. internet was fairly expensive at 120 RMB for 24 hours, but connection was easy to set up and fast. very centrally located... and the concierge all speak english and are willing to help. we enjoyed a great breakfast every morning on the 41st floor - they had such a wide selection of foods to choose from. the restaurant rotates, so you can get a great view of the city as you dine. Jul 14 2018	Good choice hotel in good location	I spent several days at the Jin Jiang Tower Hotel as part of a large group and overall my experience was very good (yes, except for the musty smell in the lobby, but that's the way it goes in humid areas). The rooms, albeit on the smaller side, are all newly refurbished in a sleek IKEA-look with excellent lighting - even small reading lights by the beds - something hard to find in even the glitziest hotels in the world.The bathroom is fine as well and is stocked with everything you possibly need, from razors to tooth brushes to wooden combs. The only negative here, as noted by another traveller, is the hair dryer stuck in a drawer - you will have to bend down to dry your hair, but at least the hair dryer is powerful.The gym is a bit small with just a few machines, there is also a larger terrace area where you can jog outside (if you do not prefer to jog through the city as my room mate did every morning - the park is not too far from the hotel).The indoor pool is very nice and large enough for 4 - 5 people swimming laps at once, I did not notice too much chlorine, on the contrary, I found the water rather fresh, clear and clean. Please note to bring a swimming cap as this seems to be &quot;mandatory&quot; in all Chinese hotel pools. (They did not enforce it strictly at this hotel). There is also a vapor sauna and a hot tub in the changing room areas.Now, the one and only thing that was TOTALLY worth the stay at this hotel is the breakfast. Never before have I seen such an abundance, there are buffet tables after buffet tables of food of all varieties: Japanese breakfast, Korean breakfast, Singapore noodles, Spaghetti, soups, Chinese dumplings, American breakfast with eggs of all kinds and also European style items, ranging from fresh rolls to one of the best dark grainy breads I have ever tasted etc etc etc. And did I mention it is served on the 41st floor in a revolving restaurant? You get a 360 degree view over Shanghai, quite amazing. This way I was able to fill up on breakfast and escape the sometimes well too average group food we were served during our trip.Another tip: Not far from the hotel you will find Cafe Costa on HuaiHuai Road for a quick and delicious caffeine fix. May 12 2018	Between great and terrible	Excellent: rooms, location, space, breakfast room.Bad: staff, lobby smell, services.Mixed feelings here. Rate was good. May 5 2018 	Not bad great location	This hotel is certainly not one of the newer ones in town. It probably was THE place to stay when it first opened, but it's beginning to show its age. The location cannot be beat because it's one block off Huai Hai Road which is one of the main shopping drags in the city. You can walk to a lot of restaurants as well, but be warned that it's several blocks from the Metro stop. If you want a decent moderately priced hotel with a very central location not too far from People's Square and the Grand Theater, this one should do. (If you want a great moderately priced hotel, you can go to the Eton on the Pudong side but it's off the beaten path.) There are better hotels with better locations but they are much higher priced. This one is run by the Chinese government so it's not quite at the same level as the luxury hotel chains, but if you don't spend lots of time in your hotel room, this one is more than adequate. The room we stayed in on the 21st floor was a solid B+ in terms of size, quality and cleanliness and the staff is accommodating enough. No complaints about noise at all. We didn't eat at the revolving restaurant on the 41st floor other than for the breakfast buffet. I wouldn't recommend it for the Chinese food, but it had lots of variety and the food was fresh. I don't have any real complaints other than the elevators can be a bit slow and the hair dryer in the vanity drawer had an extension cord that was too short forcing you to kind of bend over to dry your hair. The swimming pool was large and clean but the chlorine was on the heavy side. The women singing at the lobby piano bar in the evenings was a nice touch. Dec 30 2007 	Location location location	The Jin Jiang Tower was recommended by a Chinese friend living in Shanghai and married to a European expat. She booked the hotel for me and got great rates. It's not the same 5 stars standards as the Ritz-Carlton, I'd rate it as a good American 3+ stars but it's such a good value as the hotel is in the best location in Shanghai, in the middle of the French Concession district, wonderful restaurants and shopping and everything else. I've stayed in Shanghai on 4 different trips in 4 different hotels and this is my favorite. Nov 20 2007 	Not an international 5 Star but pretty good	I stayed at the JJ Tower for a week. It was my first time to Shanghai and I wanted a nice place for a reasonable price. The JJ Tower was a quite good. My room was very nice, recently renovated and had a great view from the 21st floor. The cleanliness wasn't great. The cleaning staff put very little effort into cleaning the bathroom and carpet... I'd hate to see what a UV light would pick up.The food at the hotel restaurant was edible, service was poor but the view made up for it. The other service in the hotel was satissfactory. The front desk staff were helpful and friendly and had decent english skills. The Business center was well equipped and internet terminals are provided. Broadband is provided in each room, but not wireless.The location is great. It's very close to Xian Tan Di (10 min walk) and the Bund (10-15 min by Taxi). There were lots of great boutiques and restaurants within 2-4 blocks (Starbucks and McD's 4 blocks away).Definately a great place to stay if you're budget is under $200 US / night. Oct 2 2007 	Not bad but needs some refurbishing	Stayed recently at this hotel with my wife. She and some of her friends have stayed here before and as business travelers, they have found it to be ok. Smoking is allowed in most hotels in China and Japan, so if you mind, make sure you reserve a non-smoking room. We forgot to add that detail, so when we arrived we were given a twin room in a smoking floor. As my wife's pregnant, we demanded a non-smoking room and got upgraded to a twin room at their executive floor, on the 34th floor. We had no problem with the upkeep of our room, but the hotel is somewhat old and needs some refurbishing. This is quite evident in the revolving restaurant, where a well-stocked and varied buffet breakfast is served daily, especially as anyone can notice that the panoramic windows' metallic mesh blinds are rusty or stained and some have been haphazardly repaired. My wife and I both speak fluent Mandarin, but we used English at the front desk and with their phone operators, and they had good, if a bit slow, English skills. There are many small shops and eateries near the hotel and a few minutes' walk takes you to a road with many Western brand boutiques. The subway station is a good twenty minutes away, and not that easy to find, but taxicabs are plentiful and not expensive. Wished I had tried their 6th floor pool but didn't have the time. The Xintiandi district of restaurants, galleries and shops is about 30 mins. by foot. We were in Shanghai in late September and it was 28 degrees Celsius but very humid. Our Shanghai friends say that this was cooler weather, but we sweated a lot. By the way, there are many Jin Jiang hotels in the Shanghai area, and this chain is a &quot;Chinese brand&quot; that went public sometime last year, I think. Sep 30 2007	Good location	We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour group. The rooms were okay-- the carpet in the rooms seemed a bit worn but not bad in cleanliness. Everything else was in clean and in order. It is not a 5 star hotel. 3 or 4 stars are more appropriate. Staff was excellent-- very good service and well trained. Internet worked fine. Location in the French Concession area was a plus for me. It had a feel like we were in a neighborhood where people actually lived. The taxi to places of interest is very cheap (11 Renmenbi to the Bund). Be aware that taxis can be hard to get in some places, like the Old City area, during rush hour. We had a free breakfast coupon as part of the tour package. The breakfast buffet at the top (a revolving restaurant) was excellent with chinese and western food choices. We had one night not part of the tour and the charge for breakfast was about 170 Renmenbi. Oct 14 2006 	Convenient and great breakfast	Although we had wanted to stay closer to the Bund and old city, we had trouble getting in because we were in Shanghai at the beginning of the National Day week. This hotel was still conveniently located and taxis to the museums or other locations in western Shanghai were only a couple of dollars. The lobby is nice, people polite, most of the staff at the desk and concierge spoke english well. Bell staff promptly obtained taxis and we never had any difficulty with them communicating with the taxi drivers about where we wanted to go. The breakfast is a huge buffet on the 41st floor, which is a rotating restaurant. Most days were sunny and the view was incredible. All in our party enjoyed the food, there was a lot of variety and it was good. You could have eggs cooked to order, asian food (great vegetables!), fruit, cereal, meats, just about anything you could think of. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the coffee was, and my tea loving friends liked the tea. The only issue at all was it could be quite cool in the restaurant, so we and the food would get cold.My issue with the hotel was the lack of cleanliness of the rooms. The bathrooms were ok, minor problems with the grout, but the carpets are filthy. I don't think they know what a vacuum is, the carpet never appeared to have been swept during our stay, and I venture has never been steam cleaned. Thank goodness for the complimentary slippers, I wore them at all times. The beds were very comfortable and other linens were clean. The drapes were dirty too.My husband used the gym and spa a few times, including the whirlpool and foot massage, and gave it good marks. One little tip, and perhaps those of you who travel more already know this, but I couldn't figure out how to turn the lights on at first...in the couple of Chinese hotels we stayed in, there is a small slot near the door where you have to insert your key card, and that activates the electricity in the room. If you didn't know this, I just saved you a few minutes of fumbling in the dark, as the doorman didn't tell me. Sep 6 2006 	$7.00 cup of coffee!!	After a long day of traveling, I arrived at the JinJiang Tower. We had to use the side door, since the lobby was under construction, and the front entrance was all closed off. My booking was arranged via a business collegue in Shanghai who lives their, so I would have thought I got a good deal. But after my arriving home, and reading some of the posts here, I paid to much. Did not get breakfast, and the room was so-so.What really urked me was the price of the cup of coffee in the lobby, 55RMB, that is that is almost US$7.00 I almost flipped! In China??? A beer on the top floor is actually cheaper.From a location point of view it is a reasonably nice location. But taxi's are reasonable, so everything can be close by. Aug 24 2006 	Not Recommended...	Arriving from an amazing time at the MO in KL, we had high expectations. Unfortunately, this so-called 5* hotel was very poor. Firstly, hotel got booking wrong and gave us twin beds instead of double. They could not change us until the next day, not a good start. The rooms they gave us were not up to the standard of 5* hotels. The bathrooms were very small, there was only a plastic shower curtain above the bath tub to act as the shower and the toilet was in the way of the wash basin. If they want to keep their hotel as 5*, then they definitely need a complete overhaul of the rooms. Service was average with again much improvement needed. Even though we got a good rate for this hotel, we were extremely disappointed so after staying for 2 nights we changed to the Shangri-la in Pudong. Jul 11 2006 	Decent Hotel	I recently stayed at the Jin Jiang Tower for 2 nights. Shanghai is an amazing city.The Tower had an impressive lobby, but the rooms were a little dated. Everything was very clean but I agree with another post that it could use an update. I also found the staff in the restaurant and at the front desk to be a little curt. Also, the front desk closed during the night, which made it hard for myself and my group of jet lagged friends to get assistance or call other rooms. Most hotels I have stayed at have 24 hour front desk staff. Also, the elevators took FOREVER.The neighorhood was ok, there was a lot of shopping nearby (within a couple blocks). However, if I were to go back to Shanghai, I would prefer to stay closer to the Bund. Overall, I would probably not stay here again. May 17 2006	Loved the Jin Jiang	The Jin JIang Tower is in the heart of the French Concession, and a cheap taxi ride to the Bund. Our room was clean and huge, the bathroom was a little dated, but for $135/night it was a great deal. The lobby was beautiful, although it did have a weird smell that fortunately didn't seem to escape anywhere else in the hotel. The best part about staying at the Jin Jiang was the free breakfasts in their rotating restaurant with beautiful views of the entire city. We would return here anytime. Nov 13 2005	Would not stay at Jin Jiang Tower again	The common facilites were good but our standard room and 2 others they tried to move us to were poorly maintained. The carpet was very dirty and worn. I would guess it had never been replaced and seldom cleaned. The bath was dirty and full of mildew and mold. A bottle of Tilex would have done wonders. It is a shame because the facility was really nice at one point and could be upgraded with minimum investment. It was our onlybad experience in hotels in China.

"Sep 9 2021 	You can find something better	Our room was pretty old but clean. On arrival we were upgraded to a big suite, which was a nice surprise, still they should refurnish the rooms.Breakfast was ok, nothing special though. The staff were not very friendly or helpful, a mix of not understanding and not caring.The hotel is far from everything, but a taxi ride to The Bund costs only about 25RMB, very cheap.I think you can find a better hotel for the same price. Jun 26 2021 	Overall a very good experience	I stayed here on a freind's recommendation that this was closer to the &quot;real Shanghai&quot;. I was not disappointed. The rooms were very nice - not 5* - but 4*+. Breakfast buffet was very, very good as well as the coffee served during breakfast time.The hotel is about 400M from the Metro so it was fairly convenient. If you feel like taking a stroll, the #3 line is about 1KM away. Best of all, the staff was very accomodating and they do speak english and they are very helpful.All in all, a very good stay. Aug 24 2018 	Comfortable Hotel but Business not Tourist Location	If you want a hotel that is near a motorway then this is a good one for you. Actually it is situated vitually underneathe the intersection of two main Highways in the North WEst of the City. Location wise it suits the businessman but really inconvenient for the traveller. Fortunately the Travel Co I was travelling with provided transport to downtown - fortunate as this hotel is nowhere near a subway station or anything of interest whatsoever.Taxis are very cheap still in China so it is not a disaster.Bar in the lobby is souless - but the rooms are spacious, clean and the bathrooms are very big. Buffet breakfast provides western and oriental cuisine and is fine. Jun 15 2018	Location could be a problem	I can rate this hotel as above average for me, because at the end of all day touring I had no desire to go out at night. I did have a look around and there is nothing to do in the vicinity. No bars, clubs shops or restaurants.The modern hotel did provide good facilities with food and service being of a high standard. Aug 24 2017 	Management problems	The hotels name is now Shanghai Lansheng Hotel, does not carry anymore SAS Radisson in its name.The rooms are spacious, clean and well acceptable. It is however very evident that the hotel is facing a range of management problems. Facilities which the hotel may have had in the past like KTV, disco are closed. The bar most time closed, when I looked into it it was always empty.The hotel is suffering unfriendly male pe3rsonnel presenting some attitude like not having to serve Non-Chinese guest. The only highlight some friendly female trainees which better than all the other hotel staff.During 2 months of stay I noted frequent interruptions of the supply of water to the guest rooms due to maintenance. On some occasions these interruptions exceeded the time as indicated on the hotel TV channel.Negative also the location, no real attractions in the vicinity of the hotel.Considering the 4 stars and it’s 4 star price, Shanghai certainly to provide better options. Acceptable only at a discounted low rate. Jul 11 2016	Bad location	We stayed in Shanghai for 4 nights in June 2016 at this hotel. Out tour operator Kuoni offered 2 hotels in Shanghai - this one and the Shrangri La (which was very expensive). We had concerns about the location before we left and were proved correct. There is absolutely nothing around the hotel. You have to get a taxi wherever you go and need to avoid doing this in rush hour as it takes longer. The taxis were cheap but when we tried to get a taxi from the New World to the hotel at night some of the taxi drivers did not know where the hotel was and did not take us. On one occasion, we had to direct the taxi driver to our hotel - not easy when he did not speak english.The breakfast was average, although the rooms were a good size. The view from the hotel room was uninspiring - a concrete jungle. Having been there, I think it would be better to stay at Howard Johnson or Ramada. We did ask our travel company for an alternative, but they were unable to offer this to us. May 3 2016	Great Hotel would go back again and again!	I loved this hotel, the rooms were big, clean and nicely decorated, we had a king size bed, huge bathroom with seperate shower and bath, breakfast was lovely, there were some works going on outside of the hotel but didn't effect our stay, good location 5 star! Nov 9 2015 	stay away travellers beware	this hotel was the worst experience of my life all the rooms smelt mouldy and they even had a dehumidifier in the middle of the lounge area i wouldnt recommend it to my worst ememy Oct 22 2014	Stay somewhere else	We stayed here May 2014 for over a week and were disappointed. Rooms: The rooms were badly in need of a remodel. The carpet was faded and stained. The bathroom wasn't cleaned well. The bedding was old and dingy. The room and entire floor reeked of smoke even though it was a nonsmoking room. The view was interesting, especially in the morning when the bicycle traffic comes by. The breakfast served was good, though the same every day which gets boring.Location: This hotel is far from nearly everything. You will have to take a taxi everywhere you go. It was about 20 or 30 minutes to get downtown to all of the main sites. Fortunately that taxi ride was often only $5. Overall, there are many other nicer hotels in better locations. I would not stay here again. Nov 17 2021	????? Sep 21 2021 	?????????? Mar 29 2021 	????? Mar 1 2021 	?????? Sep 11 2017 	Solides Hotel Lage"
"Simple hotel - Good location	We travelled for a quick business trip to Shanghai and stayed at this hotel because of its location. It is located in the Bund, walking distance away (6 or 7 blocks) from Nanjing road (the main shopping avenue).The hotel is very clean. The room was small but had a 42'' plasma (with Chinese TV only) and a computer on the room with free internet. The window could not be open. The bathroom was small but OK.This hotel is ideal for leisure travellers with little time to waste on taxis or subways (Shanghai's traffic can be really messy). I would not reccommended it for long stays or business trips.Mrs Zhang in the front desk was very helpful and friendly and speaks really good English (which is not easy to find in many Chinese places).Bottom line, it's a 3 star hotel, nothing fancy about it, and you get exactly what you are paying for. Nov 2 2021 	Room was great staff were rude and incompetant	If you are looking for just a room and don't need any help from the hotel, then this hotel would be perfect. The room was clean and comfortable (after travelling throughout Asia, the bed was a welcome change from usual hard pads). There were no windows in my room, which may not be ideal for couples, so I would suggest inquiring beforehand. I used the laundry service and I was quite pleased with the results. I wouldn't suggest the breakfast they serve. It's a cheap buffet, but they have tastier options outside. The location was nice, being situated right next to the bund and walking distance to the nearest subway station and mall. The wireless internet wasn't working properly for the duration of my stay.This was the last extension of my trip, so I needed some help from the front desk for things. 1) I needed to make an international call. It didn't work. I was told to confirm the number and dial 011 first. I went back to my room and tried again but couldn't get it to work. I went back downstairs and waited in line again to be served. They then made a call to someone and told them to activate my phone. So I went upstairs and tried again. Didn't work. Then I went downstairs and waited in line again. I asked them to confirm what I have to dial to get out of China, and they told me 0011. So I went back and tried it, but it still didn't work. Long story short, I waited in line 5 times just to find out that the numbers they were giving me were wrong and they didn't bother to activate my phone first.2) I needed help booking a day side trip. I asked them if they provide the service. The woman looked like this was a huge inconvenience and said I should go there myself to book it. I told her I didn't speak Mandarin and thought I needed some help. She assured me that they would speak English there. I also told her that I wanted to book it all in advance so that I would get a seat, but I didn't want to spend a day journeying to the ferry port just to book and come back again later. She assured me that if I went the day of when I wanted to go, I would get a seat. I asked her if she was sure, and she assured me I would be fine. Sure enough, I make the journey there and not only was the day trip that I wanted booked solid for the next two days, but all the other ones as well. Wasted an entire day and never got to do the side trip.3) Wanted to exchange money, was told to come to the desk whenever I wanted. I came at 5pm and was told the exchange desk is only open from 9 to 4pm. I was seriously low on yuan and had to spend the night in the hotel because of it. 4) Asked for a map, was told that it would cost me money. I showed them a rather simplified map that I had and asked them to point something out on it, and they told me that just pointing out the spot would also cost me money. So I guess the room charge is exactly that, a room charge only. Don't expect any help from the staff. Oct 15 2021 	You get what you pay for!	This hotel is in a good location but its quite odd. The rooms are really tiny and uncomfortable and some of the staff are unhelpful, but for the location its good value for money and I think you would struggle to find a better hotel for the price in a location so central.We only stayed for four nights and it was okay. It did the job and served its purpose. We were happy to move on though. Four nights was definitely enough for us. Aug 4 2021 	A Dump	Based on tripadvisor reviews i booked a roomin this hotelwith a window. turns out window here means a fixed opaque glass pane. therefore no ventilation. with august temps rising above 30 degree celsisus, the hotel regularly switches of the central off or has a faulty AC system meaning around 3 a.m. you may wake up sweating and feeling suffocated and the fixwd glass 'window' can't be opened. they do nothing about it and the reception don't speak much english. room lighting is so bad that you feel you are in adungeon somewhere. everything feels damp and clammy. breakfast and bar/restaurant is overpriced. everything around resembles a huge construction site especially the bund. there are no location advantges by staying here as taxis are cheap and with so much construction, you can't really walk anywhere on the bund. go somewhere else unless you want to experience the black hole of calcutta Jul 22 2021 	Great location Great staff humid rooms	Stayed at this hotel from the 14-22nd of July for business. had booked a room through agoda and got a good price for the basic room. From Pudong airport, i took the maglev to longyang rd. then the metro line 2 to Nanjin rd. east (cost 50+4 rmb) in total. The hotel is located a 10 minute walk from the metro station. Perfect location for access to the city in my view. two mini markets are located 1 minute away, and you can choose among a japanese/chinese, plus two chinese local restaurants within 2 minutes walking.RoomsFrom the other reviews of this hotel, I was prepared for the small room size, so this was no problem when i saw that this was actually very true. Unfortunately I was disturbed the first night, by the aircon, which is directly above the head of the bed. Even while off, there was a strong draft sound, throughout the night from the airvent, which made me ask for a new room the following day. I got a new room with no problem, that was a bit bigger, and here the sound from the airvent was a little less disturbing.. Only real criticism I have of both the rooms is that the humidity in the room, felt very high, through the 7 days I stayed here. Even though the hygrometre showed about 55-65, my clothes in the suitcase was cold and wet, even though I had not unpacked it. Same thing goes for the bed and linning. I have a theory about the hotel in general is using a bad centralized airconditioning system for the rooms. Staff and other servicesThe staff present during my stay was very friendly and treated me well. English knowledge is okay for basic inquiries. I never used the restaurant or any other services the hotel offered, except from the FREE wireles internet, which was a great thing. Only the wireless connection is free, LAN costs 30 rmb a day. The hotel in general is nicely decorated and has dimmed light.PS. If you do not already have a plan for your visit, I recommend getting a personal guide. I can personally recommend Aron, who has helped me: shanghailocalguide.com. Another tip is to make a survival list with the 10-15 most basic Chinese words and sentences and take it with you every where. Best regards C.B.Pedersen Jul 21 2021 	Past its prime	You can tell this used to be a grand hotel. Not anymore..When we first checked in we got to our room, a tiny cot with no window, even though we booked with window. As the error was corrected we got to a slightly larger, as dated and dirty room. Extremely hot, dirty bathroom and dated interior.On the plus side, the location is pretty good, and I guess it is hard to find a hotel this cheap as central as it is. If you can handle bug bites, then go for it! Jul 21 2021 	Decent but could have been better	The hotel is reasonably well situated, but since I was on vacation I would have preferred being rather in French Concession area. Nanjing road is just too stressful with so many aggressive sales men during day and hookers during night. I stayed for two weeks, so I got to know the surrounding place very well. There were no cafes or bars anywhere nearby. You had to walk at least 15 minutes to find the nearest Starbucks. Subway station wasn't too far. Beds were hard. Room was decent, but small with no windows. I had the most basic kind of room. So although, it's a decent deal for the price, I would have rather paid extra 10-20 euros and gone to a better hotel. Jul 15 2021 	Great value great location clean and friendly staff	Really nice hotel in a great location, near the subway, and the main sites. The staff are really friendly, the room was a good size, and had good facilities. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who was a nice but great value hotel. Jun 29 2021 	Good for business travel and GREAT LOCATION	Good overall hotel, and very clean. Excellent location, walking distance to the Bund, Nanjing Lu, metro station, and to plenty of cabs. Art Deco decor. Not overly content with the service, small room with no window, small wardrobe, small bathroom. Jun 18 2021 	Comfortable Rooms in an Ideal Location	At first the hotel was a bit hard to find as there was extensive renovations going on in the area, no fault of the hotel. It is on Dianchi Road behind the Peace Hotel which is right on the Bund. To get there we took the Maglev from Pudong Airport and then took the Metro line 2 from Longyang Station to East Nanjing Road Exit 3. The hotel is 5 minutes walk from there in the direction of the Bund just ask someone in the area for directions.The room was small but very comfortable, it was clean; there was a kettle, coffee, tea hair dryer and free internet. It is reasonably priced given the location, do keep in mind it’s a business hotel. Again the Bund is just a 2 minute walk around the corner and the famous shopping street Nanjing Road is a 5 minute walk away. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful. Jun 7 2021 	Comfortable rooms and great location	I usually pick hotels based on location first. This hotel is suited perfectly as it is right next to the Bund and a short walk to the metro. The only thing I ask in a hotel room is to provide me with a comfortable base to return to, since most of the time I will be out sightseeing. The Manhattan Business Hotel provides exactly that.I booked a Common Room. It's a very small room with the king size bed taking up most of the room. There are no windows, which didn't really bother me. The only thing is that you can't tell if it's morning or night except by looking at the clock. They put plenty of mirrors which give the illusion of more space and also helps with the lighting. The room is a little dark. I could have used brighter, white lights.The bathroom is small, but clean and has new fixtures. It is hidden behind a sliding mirror door. You only get a shower stall and not a tub, but I only take showers. The towers are new and soft! I can't tell you how many times I've gotten worn out scratchy towels at hotels.There is also a small armoire to hang your jacket or pants, and there is a small safe inside. There is also a small desk and a wall mounted LCD tv (it was a 26&quot; tv I believe). I usually only watch CCTV-9, the English language international channel when I'm in China, so I don't miss HBO or other American channels. I wish they had managed to fit in a small refrigerator though. Not that crucial as there is a Family Mart a block away.Wi-fi worked perfectly for my netbook. They had two connection points on the fifth floor, and either one worked great. The signal was good (3 out of 5 bars for me).For around $45 a night, this room was perfect for me. If you traveling with another person or family, I'd definitely get a bigger room, but I would definitely book this hotel again. You can't beat the location and value. May 30 2021 	FANTASTIC	I travel extensively for business and pleasure. This hotel's room gave me much pleasure and relaxation. The room quality, size, offerings far exceed the cost. In fact the Executive Suite with the amazing Jacuzzi tub and outrageous huge shower, fantastic size room with so much room to &quot;hang&quot; out and relax in made me feel like a very rich celebrity but on a realistic budget. Location was great. Shopped and was able to enjoy the &quot;bund&quot; even though I only had one night to do it in. Loved it so much am going back next week for this next business trip. Very unusual as I enjoy staying in different hotels everytime. This hotel offers an incredible amount for the price. Service was fantastic. May 2 2021 	No Window	Good location near the Bund area. 5 min walk to enjoy the spectacular view. go at night prefer on weekend, when they light up all the building. Great. Staff is friendly, with a Spa on the ground floor, the services is quite pricey thou. You could get less expensive spa else where. The room is extremely small with a big plasma TV, so it quite difficult to enjoy the TV and it got NO WINDOW. Mar 31 2021 	Superb Hotel with a great location in Shanghai	I stayed at the executive suite for six nights and found the hotel just great!! Very friendly and professionell staff with a superb location just off The Bund. My suite, which I got for about 90 dollars, was really worth the money. You had to walk for 30 seconds to reach The Bund and one minute to reach Nanjing Road East. The Hotel was really really clean. The bed was pretty hard which is always get case in China! Recommended!! Feb 24 2021 	Good location comfortable yet daggy hotel	I stayed at the Manhattan Bund Business Hotel for a couple of nights in February 2021. None of the maps I viewed prior to booking gave an accurate indication as to its location - so FYI it is located behind/next to the Peace Hotel (North). Dianchi Rd runs parallel to Nanjing Rd for one block between Zhongshan Rd (The Bund) and Sichuan Rd. And the hotel is about a 5min walk to either the Bund or Nanjing Rd. And about a 10min walk to the nearest subway station.None of the reception staff spoke much English, but enough to get by (barely). My room was an Executive Suite, and it was HUGE!!! with lounge/receiving area, work area/desk (and computer) and king sized bed &amp; 42&quot; LCD. The rooms however were very daggy, and it looked like they were styled in the 1970s. The bathroom was big, and included a spa bath, and an awesome multijet shower. High speed internet was available via a wired connection (and computer) in to room for 10yuan for 24hrs access, or free via wi-fi - however the only place in the room I could get a strong signal was on the floor just inside the door (not very convenient, considering how big the room was). Contrary to other reviews, the rooms do have windows; you just can't see out of them as they are frosted glass - not that there is a view anyway. The buffet breakfast was extremely good value for 48yuan. I never had dinner at the restaurant as there was a multitude of places to eat nearby. Drinks in the in room fridge were also quiet cheap for a hotel, yet still not as cheap as at the mini mart at the end of the street.The only things I didn't like about the hotel were:- The only tourist maps they had of the area were in Chinese - No English maps at all.- The lack of decent wifi signal in the room.- Communication with the reception staff was difficult as they had little English skills. Even asking what the days weather was to be got to be a chore.All in all, for the price I paid for the Executive Suite (~AU$150/nt) I got a very good deal, and if I ever go back to Shanghai, I would strongly consider staying here again . Nov 19 2008 	Better than 3 star hotel	I would say this is another good hotel to stay, it is about 5 min walk to the metro station, the station is in 1 plaza exit at no. 3 if you fly to Pudong airport you can get out by maglev train (40 yuan) then get the metro at Longyang station metro line 2 (green line) then go to East Nanjing station 4 yuan get out at gate no. 3 then walk down to the Bund ....might be a little difficult to find the hotel so i just ask the people around there.  There is a family mart near the hotel, and some place to eat breakfast and dinner. This hotel is near the Bund which travelers must go to see and take picture here with the Orient tower. When we got into the hotel, the room is small but they put lots of mirror in the room so it's look bigger, in the room every equipment is there, kettle, coffee, hair dryer, a big LCD tv. The bahtroom is very small no tub but it's clean and it's ok if you just want to take a shower. The room is clean and bed is ok ....blanket should be more thicker and also there is only 1 pillow for each people and it's very flat. If you didnt stay in the room much you will not be complaint about the tv channel which there is HBO and CNN only for you to watch and the rest is Chinese channel. Anyway this hotel is cheap try to book by agoda website. I will say this hotel is almost 4 star hotel. Aug 23 2008 	Good hotel has its quirks	I stayed at the Manhattan Bund Business Hotel for a couple of nights. I got to the hotel late, due to a late flight - I checked in at 2am, but had called before to let them know, so it was all fine. The reception staff are efficient, although not all of them know English - one day, I talked to a very fluent guy and a very fluent lady who gave me information. The next day, the receptionists did not know English and had to resort to calling the English-language Guanxi telephone line to resolve my query (I was asking for directions).The rooms are small and have 1970s decor, which is charming in its own way. The bathrooms are ok, but are a bit small in size. There is an in-room safe and net connection (wifi and wired). The service was good - I left the room in the afternoon on the weekend, and it was cleaned before I got back. When they figured out I was a foreigner, they left an English-language paper, which was considerate.The room had free net connection via an in-room computer, and several high-speed wifi which I connected to with my laptop. These were very good. My gripes about the room were:1. No fridge2. The bedsheets had a tear in them on the second night3. The underside of the sink tap was encrusted with I don't know what....obviously not cleaned too well4. No desk....in a business hotel, how are you supposed to do work with no desk?The bar and restaurant was empty throughout my stay. However, it has atmosphere, due to the 1970s feel, and the barman and bar-lady are friendly and really helpful. Beer is 25 Yuan a bottle, which is expensive for China, but not that expensive for hotels in China. I didn't try the food here, as it was expensive and anyway there are lots of places around the hotel to have food. I didn't try the massage and sauna as I heard that these are kinda expensive. A business centre would also be helpful....The location was good - a minute from Nanjing Road, 5 minutes from Nanjing Road East metro (line 2), and a minute from the Bund. The area is very safe, even very late at night. Yes it is dark, but I didn't see anyone dodgy around here. And it's easy to catch taxis from outside the hotel, as there is always one (or two) waiting. There is also a small supermarket, and a Family Mart, on the corner near the hotel, for essentials such as toothpaste, bottled water, snacks and baozi (although the baozi I saw were kinda old!). Aug 7 2008 	Good deal. Good location. Little old!	I saw the reviews from Trip Advisor so booked it through Expedia. The location is great - only one block over from the famous Nanjing Road, the Bund, and plenty of shopping! The only downside is the again the location as it's off the main road, so the evenings can be a little dark walking back to the hotel. At night, it's definitely a little scary but if you with someone else (ie. spouse) should be OK. There's enough people out at all times of the day that it's not bad.The restaurant on top (8th floor) could be better. There's no free breakfast with the stay which is very disappointing. Prices are alright by Canadian standards but pricey for China.The room is very small. Be enough for two at most! There's no minibar fridge so we couldn't have cold drinks when we wanted, which was often during these summer hot days!OVerall I was ok with the stay but would look for something on the main road next time but you can't beat the price! Jul 16 2007	Good location small basic rooms	Although close to the Bund &amp; Nanjing Road, you will want to upgrade/book a large room if staying here for more than one night and want a level of comfort. As per other reviews, the basic rooms are TINY. Our 1st room, the size of a walk-in closet, had a tiny non-operable shaded window &amp; the decor, while “Asian exotic&quot; with dark colors was a bit dark and depressing. As we and our bags barely fit in the room, we paid several hundred USD more (for a week stay) to upgrade to a larger room -so much for a budget hotel. The larger room had lighter décor and a large operable window, a King-size bed, mini fridge, hot pot, desktop computer, large flat screen TV &amp; small shower (no bath) within a very tiny bathroom. The carpet, dirty and stained, was not vacuumed during our stay. Housekeeping was very inconsistent in terms of cleaning the floor, counters, replenishing water, &amp; providing a newspaper, etc. Laundry service was good &amp; reliable. Despite its name, by no means is this a business hotel; no clock in the room, no on-site business center, wireless internet rates are confusing and convoluted, and printing docs at the front desk is quite a task. The desk staff speak VERY little English. The hotel restaurant on the top floor was always empty, as well as a bit dark and dismal, but ok for a quiet drink. Great location if you want to be close to the Bund (near the entrance to the Psychedelic tunnel) but next time we will stay closer to the Sofitel area in the Nanjing or French Concession area. Apr 27 2006 	Nice hotel great location 	I've been staying on business in Shanghai on and off for a couple of months now, and have had an incredible amount of trouble finding a hotel that (a) wasn't going to rip me off and (b) had service approaching the usual international standard. I tried the Manhattan Business Hotel on the Bund (historic riverside area of Shanghai) on the strength of a Japanese guidebook review.Turned out pretty well. It's just off the Bund main drag, just off Nanjing Lu (the main commercial thoroughfare of Shanghai) and two minutes walk from the underground/subway. Historic looking building, friendly front of house staff, and I got a suite for 777RMB ($100).Broadband in the room, nice shower, lots of free mineral water.Breakfast was good - freshly made real coffee, orange juice (as opposed to orange squash served in the last 4* hotel I stayed at in Shanghai), and nice service (a waiter spotted I wanted some toast, and made it for me in the buffet toaster- without a word of request from me).Only one downside is that for some strange design reason, none of the rooms have clear windows - all frosted glass or no windows. And they don't open. Weird.It doesn't have a swimming pool, exercise room or Michelin starred restaurant. But if you want a reasonably priced centrally located hotel with friendly staff, I'd recommend it strongly. Aug 26 2021 	Buena ubicacion Jul 21 2021 	hotel comodo ma niente di eccezionale Jul 21 2021 	?????????? Feb 23 2021 	????????? Jan 16 2021 	Excelente ubicación"
"Jul 24 2021 	Great Value Excellent Hotel	These apartments are just wonderful. The rooms we stayed in, were, I think, at the &quot;left back&quot; which had a fantastic view - the higher the floor. We stayed on 7th floor for 3 nights, then stayed in Hangzhou Hyatt regency for one night – (to see Solar Eclipse - Main reason for our trip) - and then stayed a further night on top (38th) floor....wished we had asked for a higher room for our earlier stay. We looked out towards the Oriental Pearl Tower and World Trade Centre..which we nicknamed the bottle opener....The window stretched the whole side and round the front &quot;end&quot; of the apartment, which gave a fantastic panoramic view...especially great at night.The members of staff are very courteous and efficient. Very helpful, particularly as we had problems with our credit card having been blocked by our bank after first use, (Foreign travel/Bank issues...another story). Reception staff not at all phased and very willing to find solution. Every request was met quickly and nothing seemed too much trouble...we were very jet lagged (15 hours out of sync from home) and probably seemed a bit grumpy at times...but they accommodated that.The rooms are very spacious, ours was wedge shaped, but looking at fire plan on back of room front door, there were at least 4 different types of layout. The room was very clean...I am extremely fussy about cleanliness in any type of rented accommodation, especially in kitchens and bathrooms, and to be honest I could hardly fault either...it was almost as if we were the first to use the room after a new fitting out....We had one large bedroom with comfortable king-size bed, large plasma TV (separate to living room TV), loads of cupboard space, both hanging and drawers, a safe and iron and ironing board...hidden in cupboard. The living room had a sectional sofa (chaise) (this was a bit hard and had silk throw cushions which slipped about, so a tad uncomfortable), a glass topped coffee table and matching side table (not glass), glass dinner table with two comfortable chairs, desk and chair with internet access via cable (wireless would have been preferred), large plasma TV...with connections for your own AV devices via wall sockets. All the rooms were literally packed with features and almost everything had been thought of. An extra rollaway bed was provided for us, was a bit pricey considering we had booked an advance purchase rate of 890RMB, 300RMB for an extra bed rather bumped up the price....but still very good value overall.The fully equipped kitchen has upscale fittings, including a “sensing” microwave, full oven, garbage disposal, dishwasher and large fridge with three drawer freezer. The Bathroom has a front loading washing machine and separate tumble dryer.Recommend you take with you a small supply of dishwashing liquid, dishwasher tablets and clothes washing powder/liquid. Was difficult to find in local shops and very expensive for much more than needed for a short stay. The utensils in the kitchen, including knife block, full set of pots and pans and full sets of crockery, cutlery, and glasses were of an excellent standard. You could certainly prepare and cook as if you were at home...but you need to bring/buy everything food wise like oil and condiments etc. We found a “supermarket” in the basement of the local upscale shopping mall. It had everything you could need, but I suspect as prices in China go this was the Marks and Spencer end of the market. E.g. 99RMB for a medium sized bottle of concentrated washing liquid (clothes)...about US$15....But the fruit and veg were great, and they even sold Speckled Old Hen cans of beer........The bathroom has a large bathtub, deep and long enough for a good soak, with a hand held shower attachment and also a separate glass shower cubicle. In the roomy tiled and glass doored shower cubicle the fittings to switch from overhead rain shower to hand-held were a bit tricky (because of trendy square design), but the water pressure is excellent, so a great showering experience.I see others thought breakfast only average....I found it excellent for this type of hotel, a large choice of different types of breakfast including “American” bacon and sausage, Chinese dishes, continental cheeses, cereals, fruit, juices, toast, pastries etc....The room service, however, left a bit to be desired, I suppose that because these are “serviced apartments” you cannot expect the usual room service quality. The food itself was mostly OK, however it was disappointing that it was not always as described...e.g. the torpedo steak sandwich was not the tender steak advertised in the menu, (but then again they rarely are)...however it was missing the “roasted onions”, which meant that it was lacking in taste...when I complained, instead of bringing up a small dish of onions they came and took the plate away to add them....and brought back the same meal...now cold....(lucky able to heat up in the kitchen...). Then, on another occasion when only a snack was needed, the “crispy chicken wings with hot chilli and lemon mayonnaise” were not crispy...and arrived only with tomato ketchup...which they later tried to say was “spicy ketchup”. but it was still tomayo ketchup!!!...They brought up a small dish of plain mayonnaise....hmmm...sent meal back...However they were most concerned and phoned up afterwards to check i was OK. Also there were no condiments sent, no salt and pepper and no napkins.... let alone any of the usual room service frills....The pool and Spa were too cold for me, but the steam room and sauna suite and showers in the changing area were great. (Although would have been even better if not opposite the loos). We live in Caribbean, so we are used to warm water and hot sun, lounging in the cool pool area just wasn't warm enough for me, but I am sure anyone from a temperate climate would love it. But it was a shame that at the least the Jacuzzi wasn't hot.However all in all an excellent place to say, great value and although not in the tourist area, had easy connections via Metro (short walk) to rest of Shanghai...and Taxis were easy to get to and from...DO take a label with the hotel name on in Chinese for taxi drivers...English is hardly spoken, and that includes the ability to read addresses and street names in English. Pointing at the English name of a street on a map in a guide book is no good. We took a supply of labels printed in Chinese...they proved invaluable. Cut and paste from here.....(we stuck one in the guide book).http://www.sinohotelguide.com/detail_index.php?Hotel_ID=SSGH0114&amp;City_ID=SSG&amp;City_Cname=Shang%20Hai&amp;City_Lname=shanghai Useful advice for any hotel in China Jul 1 2021 	Excellent place	Do you want double the space for half the price ?. This is the hotel/appartment to stay. Very nice property, courteous staff, wonderful rooms with all the space you could want. The location is fine, close to the #2 line underground station which during rush hours is the preferred transportation system as taxi's will be hard to find. Some nice shopping and restaurants very close by. Both gym and swimmingpool are well equiped and very clean. The breakfast, though slightly limitted, is fine. Overall very good value and the place to stay. Jun 23 2021 	Very nice apartments near PuDong Times Square	This hotel is very nice, but caters to the extended stay. They really prefer to rent the rooms by the month, but will do it on a daily or weekly basis if needed.The room consisted of a kitchen, dining room, living room and large bathroom with tub and shower. There were 2 plasma TV's. The breakfast was adequate, but not as good as some of the other Western breakfasts in the area. Dinner isn't available in the hotel, although there are many nearby. The only downside for me was that the internet connection to the USA was EXTREMELY slow, and since I was using a Slingbox to the USA, this kept me from enjoying my stay and I chose to move back to the Courtyard Marriott (accommodations not as nice, but friendlier people and internet).Since internet service in Asia can be iffy at times, it might have been that they were having problems the week I was there.The room can also get very hot in the Summer, since the thermostat prevents the room from getting really cool. I understand that this is a government rule to save energy, and not necessarily a rule of the hotel. Feb 1 2008 	Nicest Place I've Ever Stayed	What a place! I'm rarely 'over impressed' with a hotel, but WOW! It's technically not a hotel, rather 'apartments'. Very modern and new decor (the place has only been open about a year). HUGE living room, FULL kitchen, gorgeous bathroom with a separate jacuzzi tub and stand-alone shower. The bedroom alone was the size of a standard hotel room--big comfy bed. My room was on an angle, which gave me floor-to-ceiling windows spanning the entire room with about a 180 degree view of Shanghai. Two plasma TVs (about a 32 incher in the bedroom and a 50 inch one in the living room). All rates include breakfast...A very good one by Shanghai standards. Mostly Western selections with a few Chinese ones.The staff was very good. And the location is good...A block from my company's Shanghai operations and plenty of restaurants right near the hotel.I said I could never live in Shanghai, but I take that back--I could live in Shanghai if I could call this place home. Again, THE BEST place I've ever stayed (and I stay in hotels 60-80 nights a year)."
"Sep 11 2021 	Good location 	This hotel is more like a mid to up market service apartment rather than a hotel, we spent 6 days and found it reasonable for the price as it is in an excellent location.The hotel is in a block about 8 floors high in the central of HuaiHai Road, the upmarket shopping street of Shanghai. The beauty of its location is that it is right above the Shanxi (South) road subway station on line#1. Sightseeing via both subway and buses is therefore very convenient even if you get tired of walking around the shopping street itself. The hotel staff are helpful and found us carpark space for our visiting friends as well as directed us to take the subway to the Shanghai circus station for a show called ERA, it was a fantastic show!The rooms are average size but we had a bigger room in the end of the block as we asked for a quiet room away from main streets where busy traffic can be seen or heard. The bathroom is a bit small but with sufficient accessories and fittings for a pleasant stay, bath and showers both work well. There are tea making facility in the room and also free broadband internet common in all China hotels. The furniture are adequate but slightly worn out. Breakfast was a good spread catering Chinese, Japanese and western style food in the top floor restaurant. Food quality is reasonable but juice and coffee are way below standard. For those who need coffee fix, there is a Starbucks next door and also a few fast food outlets across the street for those desperate for western comfort food. The Chinese style porridge is the best I have tasted since visiting HongKong but the eggs and omellettes were presented in a terrible mess. The hotel has bargains for business men who needs a room at last minute: every evening the hotel seems to have a sign selling single rooms at RMB530 inclusive of all facilities like car parking! (see photo) Aug 14 2021 	Easy to walk everywhere and in center	The best location if you plan to see all city. Very easy to go everywhere...A lot of nice rest. &amp; shops &amp; malls,.....The most crowded and best shops area in Shanghai.. Jan 21 2021 	Always Excellent Mason	This is the eight time I have stayed at the Mason, and would never stay anywhere else in Shanghai. We visit Shanghai half for business, half for pleasure, and the mason fits the bill on all counts. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern, international in style. The breakfast is great, with an omelettle/egg chef to cook to order, bacon, fresh fruit and cereals, as well as all the requisite asian dishes.The rooms are cleaned spotlessly, the internet is free in the room, and the location superb. the South Shaanxi metro is right at your doorstep, ATM at hand, and some fantastic restaurants within walking distance, eg Face Bar at Ruijin Guesthouse, and Isabella's Trattoria, just get out and investigate the side streets. Parkson Plaza Department Store is directly across the road, to stock up on bottled water and champagne. Starbucks is downstairs to kickstart you for the day. The reception staff I find to be very helpful in booking our train tickets, and handling myriad messages, parcels etc. All in all, a winner. Aug 26 2018 	The deluxe room	Well this was my third stay at this hotel and can honestly say it was a pleasure again. The last time I stayed was earlier this month (Aug 08) and upgraded to a deluxe room ,the standard rooms are pretty good so my expectations were high . I was not dissapointed.The room was larger with far more space.The room service was up to its usual excellent standards ,your washing done ,packed and ironed for a bag full for 10 UK pounds ,returned in 24 hours ,The bathroom at least matching a 4 star european equivalent . a joy to stay here ,convenient location ,reception staff speak near perfect english .if you can try the guided tours from the hotel ,especially the circus .For a few pounds you get a guide,travel in luxury ,worth every penny. You'll still need your ear muffs if you are a light sleeper but the local law enforcement have curtailed the noise to a minimum past 11pm . You can get a limousine FREE to return you to the airport by the hotel if you stay there for 5 days or longer. 10 out 10 this time round Apr 5 2018 	Good place to stay for westerners	A less expensive hotel than the more familiar big brands, which offers a lot, although some things may be missing. This won't bother you if you are there for sleep, or work, however for leisure you might need to be happy heading out.The interior is all very modern, the rooms are like new, and spacious. Some rooms don't have a bath, but just a walk in shower. There is a tv with limited english channels. No other entertainment. However the broadband access is free, via an ethernet port. Outside the rooms note there is no swimming pool, but a small gym equipment room, and two pool tables.There is a roof top bar, however it may only be open in summer, as it was closed (despite signs saying it is open). There is a ground floor starbucks, and many good places to eat nearby within walking distance.Breakfast is available - a buffet of chinese and various western foods. Don't expect a continental or full english breakfast, but you will find something to suit you.I have always stayed at the rear of the hotel, which is quiet. Overall, a good western style hotel, particularly suited to business travellers. May 27 2017 	Really liked the Mason Hotel: excellent value for money	We really enjoyed our stay at the Mason Hotel in Shanghai. Although located on a busy shopping road (Huaihai road), in a town where the traffic is very noisy, the traffic noise in the room was acceptable (on the 7th floor). That was the only downside, explaining the less than perfect score. However, half the rooms (even numbers?) are on the other side of the hotel, which should be very quiet (not from experience) .Room comfort and spaciousness was excellent, and far superior to what we got for double the price in Hong Kong, our subsequent stopover. Located in the heart of the elegant French Concession, and right above South Shaanxi metro station, with easy access to rest of city and right in the midst of many good services and tourist sights. There is a HSBC ATM next to the lobby.The hotel interior has a clean, peacefull, elegant and modern feel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast facilities were excellent offering a mix of local and Western food. Terrific value for money. Sep 8 2021 	???"
"Nov 26 2021 	Solid Business Hotel - Excellent rooms firm beds	This is a very solid business hotel. The beds are nice and firm unlike the soft mattresses in the states that are murder on my back. Rooms are very well appointed in terms of lighting, bathroom, and supplies.Service is good if a bit on the cold side.Breakfast, which was included w/ our rooms, was good but by no means the best I have experienced in Asia.Location is close to Shanghai Mart - within walking distance if you dare to deal with crossing the street Oct 16 2021 	Great learning venue	This hotel was fabulous. The accommodation rooms were beautiful...very beautiful.. you could watch TV from the bath if you didn't have jet lag so much that you couldn't have a bath. ..The conference rooms were also very good for breakout rooms and large roromos - the staff were wonderful. Oct 13 2021 	Clean and Quite	Great Hotel, Location is Key for me since i need to be in that Area.... The Gym is small but good and Quite, the Pool is very nice big and clean and the locker roms where very nice showers.... the room is great except for the bed which is as hard as a rock but otherwise sheets and conforters were excellent..... NO nightlife at all.... it has a club with great music and 2 workers but NO customers ever.... There is a Piano BAr which is also very silent..... Sep 12 2021 	Awesome Garden 	This, it has to be said is one of the best hotels that i've ever stayed in Shanghai. The view of the garden when you first arrive is magnificant. The rooms were beyond luxurious and was surely among the largest in this city. It has the most amazing pool. The staff were curtious and friendly and I felt very welcomed. The food was delicious. The hotel was just amazing and made the stay one of the best that we've ever had in Shanghai. Definately recommend this to anyone. 5 Star. It would be more ideal if there would be a BBQ party with beers in such a stunning gorgeous garden! Jul 18 2021 	If this hotel were in a better location!	As good as any hotel needs to be and the value was the best we experienced on our trip. . We were upgraded to a suite and the room and hotel were superb. The service was excellent and the staff more accommodating than we are used to having. The hotel is about a 30 minute taxi ride (only $5 cost) from the center of Shanghai and that was the only issue because there always seems to be bumper to bumper traffic on the road between the two places. Apr 19 2021 	Eerily quiet but nice	To follow the other reviews, the location is odd (and some cabs had trouble finding it, even with the location card). The staff was English-friendly and helpful but there were some glitches.The room was large and I had a garden view, which is preferable to the highway view. Bed was comfortable; bathroom was very nice.But the whole place was strangely quiet. Hardly ever saw another soul. The attractive health club was virtually empty, except for chatting staff members, which was weird and I left earlier than I would have wanted to. Business center only had 2 internet stations and I had to wait 20 minutes to use it one time. But they offered tea or juice while I waited. Mar 10 2021 	Great Staff!	Love it ! email me if u wanna know more .. only downside is the location .. it's away from the main attractions.. but nothing a pretty reasonable cab ride wouldn't solve . If its just some food and a little bit of shopping u're looking for .. fear not... theres a huge carrefour just beside the hotel ... with fast food and a food court as well .. GREAT PLACE!!! Nov 18 2018	Excellent hotel	I was in Shanghai for two days, my last two days in China and what a way to end my journey!A superb hotel!The only not so positive aspect was the location, but with all the good aspects, I can easily forget this one! You can pick a taxi and in 20minutes you're in the center! Don't worry :)Where can I start? Beautiful rooms, with everything you may need when you are in a hotel, with very modern and clean decoration!The staff really can speak english and not just say a words like all the others hotels that I stayed in China! You easily figure that the staff has formation in english and here you don't see young boys and girls working....finally some adults working here!The breakfast was superb with a big room with lots of different food!I sure would comeback to this hotel if I ever came to Shanghai again...hope so :) Sep 20 2018 	Fantastic	I can't add much to the previous reviews. This is a superb Hotel. Everything was perfect. So many lovely staff and all dressed so neatly. My room was great although be warned the bathroom has a window straight through to the bedroom. Some might not like this. As I was by myself on business it didn't worry me.Great place to stay if you want to be in the area for some reason. If I was visiting for tourism I would stay in the city.Also as previously mentioned, the Carrefour shopping complex is only a short walk. I ate in the food court a few times to get away from the hotel food. It was quite OK and the menus had English. Lots of variety and very cheap about 50 - 60 RMB with a beer.If you want some cheap clothes, watches, bags etc then the Pearl City shopping centre is about a 20 min walk further. As in a lot of places in China you have to negotiate the price down. Its great fun but play hard as they are very good at it. A good rule of thumb is to never pay anymore than half of what they initially ask, and it is always better to go down even further. Sep 19 2018 	A good hotel	Hunked down for a full week in this hotel on a corporate training course, my conclusion is:PLUS:Excellent facilities. An extremely sweet , service-minded and accommodating staff above international average. &quot;OK&quot; food (choice is very good, quality is rather average (no WOW factor - but noodle station is great); modern, pleasant and spacious rooms with all executive needs; walking distance to Pearl Market and Carrefour shopping mall and food court.Good conference facilities with excellent service and catering. Nice surrounding gardens for breaks. The Bund is a 20-30 minute taxi ride away.MINUS:The beds are hard!Internet is slow. Not the hotel's fault - you feel like 25 people are at all times checking each page you visit....The buffet varies little, Shanghai style cousine which may for many westerners be a challenge as all meat dishes are &quot;bones and fat&quot; included. There are however always good alternatives a la carte. Jul 28 2018 	Business in Shanghai Area	This is a beautiful hotel, and an oasis for people who have little to no Chinese ability. It is staffed with impeccably dressed and polite staff. After a few days of getting to know the staff, I asked an employee who had very fluent English how she managed to speak so comfortably. She told me the hotel staffed many students currently studying English as part of their business curriculum in nearby universities. These positions were like internships that gave them the chance to practice their conversational English. What luck for me! My Mandarin is BARELY usable. Hongqiao (&quot;hong-chow&quot;) is an area outside of the incredibly congested Shanghai. If you are looking for Shanghai tourism, stay closer to the Bund. If you need to get somewhere outside of the city, stay here so you don't have to fight traffic leaving/returning to the city. The most convenient thing about this hotel is that it is immediately next to a 7-story food/shopping complex. Plenty of prepared food can be found in the lower level &quot;food court&quot;; and groceries, clothing, toiletries, liquor, and souveniers are abundant. Just don't look for English speakers in the shopping complex. The only issue I had when there, was my travel agent was quoted a different price (by a LOT), and there wasn't anyone there willing to discuss how this happened, nor able to give me the price quoted. We were unable to compromise, and I ended up agreeing to paying about $100 USD per night more than planned, so check your price on the paperwork when checking in! This hotel was WAY EXPENSIVE for China, but very worth it if you can afford it. Quick warning: If you wander outside, the immediate area is pretty safe, but stay on the street side of the billboards. You are not welcome behind them by the people living in the spaces &quot;painted over&quot; by the city! Apr 30 2018 	Good Experience!	Stayed one night at the Millenium-Very nice hotel, modern decor, and clean. Most of the staff spoke english, which is always nice.Breakfast was included with my rate and I had the buffet. It was pretty good and had a fairly wide selection of items. I was surprised to see a putting green outside my window. I didn't get a chance to use it or see pool or gym.I stayed here for business, but it was within walking distance to shopping. Carrefour was next door.The hotel is pretty far south of the Bund and the Pudong area (tv tower), but if I recall correctly the hotel has a shuttle to those areas. Dec 29 2007 	I would Highly reccommend this to any traveller.	I stayed at this Hotel with 2 of my girlfriends,we had adjoining rooms that were spacious clean and very modern with a view of the surrounding city from a ceiling to floor windows. Our checkin/checkout was seemless. Cost was @ $800AUD including fantastic buffet breakfast for 6 days. Great value! The nearby supermarket was handy for ATM and personal items. Here in Shanghai you must be prepared to catch cabs form A-B .This is not an expensive way to travel but is the easiest way to get around, public transport is too complicated. Getting taxis from our Hotel was no trouble, peak hour traffic is a nightmare, which is practically 24.7. There is no catering for tourism in any of the Hotels in Shanghai. You must go with a clear idea of what you want to do and where you want to go. No brochures appear in the foyer of any of the Hotels. The staff of our Hotel were very helpful in directing us and in turn telling our cab drivers were to take us in there language. Always carry a card from the Hotel where you are staying that has the mud map of where you are to be returned to! A lot of the taxi drivers are illiterate so make sure they absolutely know where they are to take you. Jul 9 2007 	Good place to stay	Good hotel to stay in Shanghai. Only thing is it is bit difficult to get a cab from the hotel, cab drivers don't come in too often, we had to walk to near by intersection to wave down a cab, lot more cabs at the near by intersection. Overall, it is a great hotel. May 24 2007 	Good 	Just stayed there while on biz trip last week. Got a very good rate, about 800 RMBThe hotel is located in Hong Qiao, an expat area. It's just beside a Carrefour and shopping centre, so convenient if you want to do a bit of shopping. But it's situated quite a distance from Xintiandi, the Bund, Huaihai Rd and the central shopping areas. But I was travelling out of Shanghai, so the location was convenient since I would avoid the traffic in the business districtThe hotel is new, just opened in Oct 2006 according to the hotel staff. Lobby is rather grand, with 3 restaurants. Only tried the chinese restaurant and it's not bad. Less oily and salty than some of the other chinese restaurants I tried in China. Food in the hotel is quite highly priced. Was upgraded to a club room. The room is quite big and well furnished. The sockets on the desk has a multi-adapter, so convenient for travellers who need to use laptop or charge phone. bed's comfy and the bathroom is nice too. It was a rather nice stay and I would stay there again Apr 24 2007 	Good hotel just a little out of the action	This is a great hotel in many ways, the rooms are large and up to the minute with flatscreen TVs, superb bathrooms with monsoon shower heads and comfy beds plus there are an impressive aray of dining choices and a decent gym. While the staff dont speak flawless English, they make up for it by being very customer service focused and enthusiastic and proud of their hotel. On the cons side, its just far away from the Shanghai action, a good 30 min taxi ride from the Bund/French Concession etc and while that will not set you back more than 35 yuan it makes taking an impulsive stroll somewhat more difficult. That said if you want to be near Hongqiao airport or the expat districts, this is a good bet. It might also come in handy as a back stop when Shanghai's big 5star names fill up in the popular months Aug 13 2021 	???????? Mar 10 2021 	???????????? Feb 28 2021 	????????????????????? Feb 6 2021 	??????? Oct 16 2018 	???????????"
"Oct 12 2021 	Great if you have an early flight to catch	I stayed at this hotel for one night as I was in transit in Shanghai. The hotel is ideally located at the airport, in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, just above the Maglev station. My room was nice and clean. The only downside was the fact that as my room was next to the lift, I could hear people shouting (literally) outside of my front door, so did not get much sleep at all. I wasn't the hotel's fault, as it was just down to some inconsiderate guests.Reception staff were polite and friendly. May 15 2021 	Nice room great value	The location is ideal - between the two terminals, so easy walking distance, quiet. Ideal if you have a late arrival or early departure. Spacious, clean, modern room, free wired Internet. Great view of terminal, planes taking off and landing. Price 338RMB on English language website, 298RMB on Chinese language site or at check in. Dinner (RMB 38) and breakfast (RMB 20) buffets Chinese oriented, but some western food. Down the elevator to food court (Kung Fu, KFC, Pizza Hut). I will be a regular, as Northwest flights arrive late/leave fairly early.Check in and check out were fast by Chinese standards - minimal lines, fast service. But be ready to have them check the room when you want to check out, as all Chinese hotels I've stayed in do. Jan 5 2021 	Convenience 	This is a good hotel if your flight has been canceled or changed as it sits between the two terminals of the Shanghai airport. It's a good value at about $50, includes breakfast, comfortable rooms, flat screen tv and free internet for your laptop. The decor is a bit gaudy as they try to be hip, but you'll live through it. It's surprisingly quiet given it's location at the airport. If you don't feel like getting into town, you can eat at several fast food outlets as well as the airport restaurants ( tasty and good values), The transit visa is also good for 24hours so you can shoot into Shanghai on the Magdev, a super fast bullet train that will have you in downtown Shanghai in 7 minutes! Nov 27 2018 	Good value though let down by 2 big issues	This is an airport hotel situated right inside Shanghai Pudong Airport. The lift takes you up to the hotel, and down directly to the two terminals. It is therefore extremely convenient for Pudong Airport.For 298 RMB (about £28) I was not expecting much but the hotel is suprisingly modern and comfortable. The hotel itself is split into two parts - the Ease Hotel and Motel 168. My room was in the latter, with the former being more up class and probably more expensive.The room was of a good size and overlooked one of the terminals. It was also surprisingly quiet considering its location. The furniture and build was all very new and the shower room was large and modern also, all well designed. Soft carpeting and furnishings though the bed was hard and the pillows were of low quality. There is a large flatscreen TV on the wall, though Chinese channels only and a work desk. Great plus point is free internet, including use of an ethernet cable.However, this decent hotel was let down by two annoying issues. The first was that the water in the bathroom was only luke warm at most. The second was that at 11pm they decided to carry out some work to the rooms above subjecting me to constant loud banging noise until 4am. As I had to get up at 6am for a flight, I did not get any sleep which kind of defeated the whole object of being there.The room service menu looked bad and expensive though the 38RMB dinner buffet was good value (the restaurant is at the Ease Hotel). Some of the translation is also amusing.If they increase the water temperature and prevent the noise (which is hardly difficult to do), this would have got a 5 star from me. Therefore, my summary is that if you need to stay at Pudong Aiport, this is a &quot;good&quot; choice considering the price, location and facilities. Oct 24 2021 	????????????

"Oct 11 2021	Nanjing Hotel	Very convienent location. Nothing flash but clean and had everything you needed. I wouldn't bother with the breakfast. Oct 7 2021 	Happy Nanjing!	What an easy and pleasant introduction to Shanghai! For starters, this hotel is SIMPLE to get to from the airport - take the Maglev Express train to the terminus, transfer to the Metro Line 2, 6 stops to Nanjing Road EAST, out exit 1, turn right, walk less than 1 minute and voila! Nanjing Hotel. (The express train costs 50 and the metro ride costs 6 and could not be easier to navigate.)For 3 nights the location was ideal, central to everything. If you are feeling ambitious, at 7am you can walk up Nanjing Road to the People's Square and see all the morning buzz of exercisers and dancers. What a treat! The hotel itself has a quaint charm to it, I love this type of place! Like the reviewer below I was also on the 8th floor, in 801 which is a corner room, also at the end of the corridor, about TWICE as big as other rooms in the hotel, and 2 windows for a nice airy and breezy draft. I only mention that because, effective October 7, the hotel has dismantled its AC for the winter season. Great for the environment, not so great if you like a bit of air in your quarters. :) Problem solved, just ask (nicely) for a fan for the room,As for all the commentary regarding the front desk staff, I live in Asia and found the staff to be patient, accommodating, and helpful. ALL OF THEM. From the moment I walked in the hotel there was an issue with my Expedia booking that they quickly resolved. I was given a choice of rooms. I was provided a fan for my room, travel advice, restaurant advice, shopping advice, and even a hair dryer on request! I think if as a guest in China you take your time and communicate slowly you in your language, you will be met with a courteous and helpful response. As for the bedding, some reviewers complained and yes the bed IS firm but I LOVE it!! (I'd sleep on the floor if I could, hello tatami mat and futon!) If noise is an issue you'll definitely want to be on the back side of the hotel although I was on the front side and the noise completely dies down by evening. I am generally a light-ish sleeper and had no problem. Actually I thought the room and corridor were super quiet (not even sure there were any other guests during my stay- it was THAT quiet) In room broadband internet is available for .10 a mn or 20 a day, fairly reliable altho did time-out every couple of hours and the government has a ban on F@cebook, Tw1tter and Pic@sa currently in place, fyi. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. Also, I highly recommend the sichuan restaurant (told to me by the Front Desk staff hehe) around the corner (try the chicken with peanuts YUMMMM, 28!) and also the Brick Coffee takeaway stand for a delicious Iced Pearl or Milk Tea Coffee (6 and 10 respectively). See photos attached. :) Oct 6 2021 	a great find	having hunted through trip advisor for shanghai hotels i went for the Nanjing.The location really is great- 50 metres from shanghai's super shopping street, 70 metres from the Nanjing rd East metro station and right opposite 3 or 4 really good cheap restaurantsif you're concerned about any road noise at night, ask for a room whose number ends between 10 and 17.BTW a few people have said the front desk people are rude-i didn't find that- they were a bit cold but hey, how long do you want to spend at the front desk when you're in shanghai Oct 4 2021	Good location 50 m to pedestrian street metro 	My 8 night stay was especially pleasant in corner room 820 at the end of the corridor with no passing guests. The wide single beds were very comfortable. Didn't open the windows because it was hot &amp; steamy outside &amp; of course there's noise from the car &amp; motor bike horns. The step up into the bathroom was most interesting &amp; sometimes the shower took time to warm up but worth the wait to be refreshed. Didn't think the buffet breakfast for Yuan 30 worth the money (lots of food choices outside on the stalls &amp; in cafes). The restaurant menu is adequate. Room cleaning was good. Post box outside hotel &amp; PO a few blocks away has a philatelic counter. The police station is a few doors from hotel so lots of men in uniform ! English language channel is CCTV9. Walk the back streets &amp; see a very different world from the one on Nanjing Lu. Get up early to see the tai chi &amp; badminton &amp; people watch. Oct 3 2021	Extremely Rude Front Desk Staff	The previous reviewers are correct. The hotel is in a great location, right next to the pedestrian mall. The carpet is dirty, the bedding was questionnable, the bathroom is dimly lit, has a strange step up, had lots of mold and half of the showers were cold.The windows are really thin, and the noise is unreal - if you are a light sleeper, do not stay here! The worst part of this hotel is the unbelieveably rude front desk staff.When we asked for directions to a local coffee spot (Starbucks) they pretended to notunderstand. When my white son spoke Mandarin to them (he is currently attending a University in China and met us for the trip), they refused to listen to him. Finally, one ofthe rudies said to go buy a map in the gift shop...they didn't have one map at the front desk! I will never stay here again, or recommend this hotel. There are other places that are just as handy with nice, helpful, staff! Oct 3 2021	basic hotel clean good location	People at reception speak english, better than in other places i stayed.Shower has little water pressure.Nothing else to say. Basic.Super location, as good as on nanjing road. Walking distance from the Bund or the People's Square. Sep 23 2021 	Do they hate their job that much?	State of carpet and hardness of bed was no different to any other hotel we stayed in, in China , BUT the impression you get is that the staff absolutely hate their job and absolutely hate customers!! One big advantage is it's location - close to metro which is great. Close to The Bund - but that's a mess at the moment and will be for some weeks yet I would expect. Great street stalls for breakfast etc - go out door, turn right and both the next street and second street over have plenty of street stalls. Yum. Sep 12 2021 	great value convenient location	For the rate we got we did not expect the Hilton, which we did not get of course. But we got an absolutely fine room, which was clean and well looked after in a hotel with a great location near the shopping street in walking distance from the Bund (which is of course currently a big construction venue for the Expo 2020) and only a few meters away from the metro station. Did not try the food there as our rate did not incl. any breakfast. Lots of small Chinese restaurants in that street though. Overall a great value for money deal and a completely satisfied stay. Service attitude at the reception was very different, depending from which staff was catering you. One was great, two others not. But we had no probs at all. Would definitely return. Aug 30 2021 	Unbelieveable value and location	I swapped to this hotel from my hostel further from the centre. I couldn't believe that such an affordable hotel could be right in the centre of the action. It was great to wander along Nanjing Donglu at night, and then just fall into bed. It's especially good for solo travellers like me, who don't really want to be walking a long way to get back to their accommodation at night.The room was fine...clean and comfortable. Some of the staff were a bit surly, but for 300Y a night, this place was fantastic. Jul 23 2021 	Decent Hotel Great Location	I will just agree with what previous posters said. The hotel is fine - clean enough, standard REALLY hard bed, decent size room. The location is EXCELLENT making it the perfect place to stay when we only had one night to do some sightseeing.The only negative thing I found was that the lighting in the bathroom was terrible and they didn't have any maps of Shanghai available to us. Jul 16 2021	Great Hotel : )	One of the best aspects of this hotel is its location, right on NanJing road and with easy access to the underground station and the 'newer' parts of Shanghai. The hotel itself was very nice, big, clean rooms. One thing that was slightly strange is that when we were standing in the bathrooms in the rooms everyone felt dizzy!! (we were a big group and nearly everyone mentioned it!!) maybe it was just us. The staff we also very polite and helpful. Jul 6 2021 	Good location and price. Bad hotel	The price is good for the location. The room is not too clean and small. I won't stay there again. Jul 5 2021 	Best hotel in Shanghai by location and price range!	As other reviewers say, it is truly right off on Nanjing Lu. This is nice considering that this is a tourist hub. The subway stop is also at the corner which makes for a quick route to the MagLev train (to Pudong airport).There is a c-store across the street which I believe is 24 hours which is handy for snacks and water. If you're looking for a nice Americanized breakfast and free wifi, walk up Nanjing Lu toward People Square and stop in at the Costa's. I don't know if Nanjing Hotel had internet because I only had my iPhone with me.The rooms are nice. Booked on ctrip.com for around $40 - $45 a night. They are clean and comfortable. No complaints, except that the shower head's spray was a bit strong (normally a good thing, but there was no other setting). Also, my tub clogged up a bit so I would stand in water while I showered. A minor thing for me, I didn't bother to complain. The beds are standard hardness but China standards. So if you are used to that or know what that means you won't be surprised. If you're not used to it, you'll probably need to adjust to the firmness, unless you're staying at higher priced hotels.Note that the windows do open and the air conditioning works nicely. The rooms on the front side of the building have a balcony which is a treat.The TV only has Chinese channels -- but we were not there to watch TV. Our unit also had a fridge with mini-bar items, but we kept our waters and stuff in there. We also had a safe in the room that was opened by our key card. The room also come with a hot water maker and complimentary tea.The staff is helpful and nice and speak good english. The breakfast spread at the restaurant was only okay. I did not go back as there are many options in the area.Safety: There is some kind of police station or bureau next door to Nanjing Hotel. And though the area didn't feel seedy (being right off Nanjing Lu), it never hurts to see that.One last thing about this hotel. When you walk into the room you get a nice clean smell. None of that musty old hotel funk. For me, that is the moment of truth when entering a new room. Nanjing passed the smell test on the 2 different rooms I stayed in. If my budget is same, I definitely would stay here again. Hope these details help! Jun 3 2021	Great location!	Stayed in this hotel as part of a GAP tour and loved the location. Literally a 30 second walk to Nanjing Road and even walking distance to the Bund and People's Square. Also, very close to the subway. Plenty of restaurants in the area (Western and Chinese) and lots of corner stores to buy things like water and snacks (there is also a fridge also in the room to use). The hotel seems pretty old but still fairly clean with friendly English speaking staff. Balcony was also a pleasant surprise and it was nice to lean over the balcony and take in all the sights, sounds and smells of the busy street below. I highly enjoyed my stay!! Mar 18 2021	One of the best locations ever	I LOVED this hotel! It was everything you needed with a 30 second walk to Nanjing Road. I don't think you could get a better location. It was a relatively short walk to the Bund and is walkable to the Yuyuen Gardens and Bazaar.It was roomy and comfortable and had been completely renovated, although I did change rooms mid-stay and inherited a bed which made concrete seem cosy, but otherwise it was great! The first bed was good, the second will remain burned in my memory forever.There are hawkers outside who try to entice you into bad restaurants there, but just ignore them and find a quality restaurant of 90 which can be as little as 30 metres past these people. Also watch out for mad motorbike riders as you step out the front door. They stop for NO ONE!The supermarket opposite is cheap as chips and is good for getting change for the train which is 1/2 block away.The English translations all over the hotel are hillarious particularly in the lifts - I'm not sure who wrote them but make sense they did not :) Mar 5 2021 	Excellent location great value very satisfied	This hotel is great, the rooms are very clean and comfortable with lots of space, a TV, internet access (with cable), fridge, closet, safe box, and desk. The location could'nt be better, 1 block away from the famous Nanjing Rd. Subway station is 1 block away, very near. There is also a wide selection of restaurants and shops in the area. Would definitely stay in this hotel again. Dec 26 2008 	Decent Experience	The hotel is in a great location right off of Nanjing Road. It is convenient to get to most of the major sights in Shanghai. The subway stop is less than a minute walk from the hotel. The price of the hotel is also great for the location, but there are some things to mention:Our room 406 had a pretty bad stench that filled up the entire room from one of the restaurants across the street. We informed the staff but unfortunately they said all other rooms were booked. They were well aware of the stench and actually said room 406 was the worst room in the hotel as far as the smell. Upon checkout we mentioned this to the staff again and while they knew about the experience the manager wasn't in and wouldn't be in until the following day and there was nothing they could do about it.Other than the stench, the service was average and the hotel is not a bad one. There are some other hotels right in the area (actually right on Nanjing Road about 2 minutes west of the hotel on the north side that has much cheaper rates (about $5-$10 cheaper) that are available for a cheaper price and same location. All in all it wasn't a bad experience, because of the great price and great location.Not sure I would recommend the place, but if your looking not to spend much money and be central to everything and aren't too concerned about things like &quot;smell&quot;, etc then this may be a good find. Nov 4 2008	Great Location	I was looking for a hotel close to Nanjing Road and other amentities without having to pay a fortune. I found the Nanjing Hotel at 200 Shanxi Road. It is one of the Jin Jiang group. I read some reviews and the most often read statement was about &quot;hard beds.&quot; My 18 year old granddaughter thought it the most comfortable bed she had slept on and I agreed, having the best sleeps I have had for a long time. The room was large enough for comfort, very clean and was quiet and we could open the window rather to put up with the noise of an AC going all night. There was hot water at all times, both day and night. Breakfast was Chinese but eggs were available and plenty of toast and what goes with it. There were about four restaurants in the road opposite the hotel, plus a small super market and about one minute's walk took us to busy Nanjing Road with all its shops and restaurants. The staff were all friendly and the majority of them spoke English. All this for 3 nights for about $56 per night for a double! Not bad value!! Oct 24 2008	Location!!!	Location is perfect. Only few steps to Nanjing road and metrostation. The room was quite small and the bathroom smelly. There was a fridge, safety box, TV with 70 channels (only one english) and a balcony in the superior room. Average hotel with very reasonable price. Oct 13 2008	A small Oasis of Calm!	This was the 1st hotel we stopped in during a small group travel holiday. I was amazed by how many people they had working behind the small reception desk, but I wouldn't say that any of them, whilst not rude, were particularly friendly and welcoming! The rooms were clean, the linen fresh, the bathroom ok, all the important things that don't turn your trip into memorable for all the wrong reasons! The location was great, walking distance to lots of great places with restaurants galore on the doorstep. The hotel must have been peaceful because stepping outside the hotel felt like a constant game of 'chicken'! (Beware the cars, bikes and motorbikes careering up and down the road!) Sep 24 2008 	Location location location.	I stayed at the Nanjing Hotel twice on my short-stay in China, mostly because of the great location. Subway's just around the corner as well as famous East Nanjing Rd. There's a small Supermarket across the street and a couple of restaurants, as well as fruit and vegetable stands down the road (South Shanxi Rd.)Besides that, rooms aren't too spacious, but okay for a city trip. Both bathrooms I had, were way too small and kind of smelly. But the reception staff were very helpful and friendly. So, service and location are great, the rooms are good for sleeping, but nothing more. Aug 22 2008 	Great hotel for location and price	The Nanjing was the 1st hotel on my trip across Asia, from Shanghai to Bombay. This turned out to be the best hotel on mytrip. Great location, around the corner from the subway station, ona main pedestrian-only street, (Nanjing Donglu). They had a fastInternet connection for a good price. The bathroom must havebeen a recent remod, and was newer and cleaner than many I'veseen in the U.S. I did try the hotel restaurant once, and it was mediocre. There are fine places to eat next door and across thestreet. I tend to buy water from local vendors, then store it in the mini-fridge. Aug 8 2008 	Great option in the heart of Shanghai	An aged hotel, probably a luxurious one for business men several years ago. Today, a great hotel for budget tourism.You could see the TV tower and the new SWFC tower from the room window, and other skyscrapers. The room and service are all right. The breakfast is also OK, but bear in mind it's chinese breakfast !It's located close to Nanjing Road, the main commercial street in Shanghai. Besides, you could reach the Nanjing East Road metro station in about 3 minutes !! If you just see a picture of the hotel building and the street at which it's located, you won't be able to imagine all that, becasuse they are old and a little dirty, but the location is great ! Jul 18 2008	Good budget hotel in great location	An ok little budget hotel in a great location. Situated just off the main shopping street, 10 mins from The Bund one way and 10mins from the People's Park the other.Rooms were basic and clean if not a little small.Staff were helpful and spoke EnglishSubway station just round the corner. Jul 18 2008 	For those who like a city atmosphere	Our room was on level 4 but we could hear the noise from the streets quite loudly. The beds were quite firm.The hotel is a few steps away from the Nanjing Road Shopping Mall (part of the road where no cars are allowed), a walking distance to the Bund (which is very crowded at night but surrounded by beautiful lights from the buildings), the Yan'an Rd East tunnel, the pier, and the Silk King (where we got our silk dresses made). It is a short taxi ride to Old Shanghai (which I prefer to be). The service is average and the front desk people understand/ speak little English (it was difficult to find out any information about nearby tourist places). Jul 5 2008 	More than expected!	I stayed 11 nights in this hotel. To be honest my room was delux room, it was quite big, with good bathroom, fridge, safebox and a good air conditioner.The location is fantastic, very close to pedestrian area in east nanjing road and very close to metro station line 2. Just 10 to 15 minutes walk to the Bund area and even less to people's square.The stuff speaks english, but the breakfast is raelly not worth it.I recommend not to eat there, you will find lots of restaurants around.Inside the hotel is much better than how it looks from outside.I think the price is not very cheap not very expensive! If you look for a budget hotel with some standards, here is the place to be.However, there are quite a few hotels in this area with the same condition.In my opinion west nanjing road may be a better place for those who look for foreign bars and clubs and more fancy stores.Have a pleasant stay!Shahab Apr 5 2008	Good budget hotel	We stayed in the Nanjing Hotel last month. It is a good, basic budget hotel, just a few steps from Nanjing Lu. I picked this hotel because it was within walking distance to things we wanted to see, but then we never did any walking. Took taxis everywhere. Due to congestion in front of the hotel, taxi drivers may drop you off the block before. Some taxi drivers had difficulty finding the place, so be sure to take a map of its location with you.Hotel was very clean, and the front desk staff spoke very good English. Breakfast is 30 yuan (approx $5.10US), and changes many items daily. Compared to what we pay in the US for breakfast, it was very good value, but you need to like to eat vegetables for breakfast. Several times we ate food from nearby street vendors, and had breakfasts for 3rmb. We hated Shanghai (much prefer Beijing), but if we ever go back, we would stay there again. Jan 7 2008 	Good location	The best thing is the location. Otherwise it is a very basic hotel with furniture from the 80´s. Some staff members speak English, but not all. A bit noisy, remember your earplugs. Nov 3 2007 	Good location and price	Stayed here for 3 nights because we needed a cheap place - we were saving for a more expensive hotel for the end of our holiday. But we were surprised how large the room actually was for the price, and its great location right in the middle of the Nanjing Road. It was a superior twin room, but only cost a few pounds more than the standard one. The room had two single beds, two chairs, small and large table, good lighting, TV (only Chinese stations), and tea making facilities. The safe didn't work though. We had the room at the end of the floor (no.435) , with a balcony looking down on the cross roads below. It was noisy outside until about 1am, but then silent. Except one night when the builders doing up the shop opposite decided to do a bit of hammering at 3am. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was ok. The shower worked well and the towels were small but sufficient. For the price of the room it was a good hotel and we would definitely go back there. Mar 27 2007	Nanjing Hotel good for me.	The Nanjing Hotel is an average hotel. The best thing going for it is that it is located less than a city block from the Nanjing Road and a short distance from the Metro. There are several restaurants located in the area and a convenience store located across the street. The rooms are clean and some of the bathrooms have been remodeled. The west side of the hotel has balcony access for the rooms, but it is also the noisiest side of the hotel with all of the traffic on that side. The staff is helpful and can speak English. In all, I would recommend the hotel for any traveler that is on a budget that needs a quiet and clean place to sleep at. Aug 11 2006 	Okay hotel in good location	We stayed at the Nanjing Hotel from July 21 to 23 as part of a small tour group.This hotel is a very basic one. No hair dryer, no alarm clock, and no safe. But the room was a good size, and was very clean.The location is the best point about this hotel as it is just a few steps away from the central portion of the pedestrian-only zone of Nanjing Road, the major tourist shopping road. It's also near a metro station, which made it easy to get to the Maglev station to go to the Pudong Airport. One note to make is that the glass is single-paned, so it's quite easy to hear the noise outside. I would recommend bringing some ear plugs for a more peaceful sleep.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for budget-conscious travellers who want a good, clean place to stay. Jun 8 2006	Nanjing Hotel can't be beaten for location or value	After originally booking just 2 nights at the Nanjing Hotel, we immediately booked another 4 nights as soon as we saw the room as we could see it had everything we wanted for our week in Shanghai and for just 350RMB a night (internet booking), it suited our budgetOur room was a B class (better than A class) with a large bed and the softest matress we have ever had in our 18 months living and working in China. The room was on a corner and very quiet, was very clean, no stains on the carpet, the shower and bathroom was perfect and there was a bar fridge as well as tea making facilities with green tea bags.The Aircon was good and didn't cause a draft but the best thing was the room had windows you can open and good lighting thanks to a down light over the bed, a standard lamp and a desk lamp as well as other ceiling lights. Three occasional chairs, a coffe table, good size wardrobe and bedside tables with drawers made the room seem more like a suite. The TV was modern and large with about 30 channels (although only CCTV9 is in English).We asked for and got a hair dryer, and one night after having left our window open, we had a mosquito but a call to reception got us a mossie zapper.The staff spoke very good English, but the travel agency desk, like most in China, couldn't do much for us.We didn't bother eating in the restuarant (we have never eaten in hotels as its always more fun and cheaper to eat outside) and the little lane outside had about a dozen places to choose from and we had breakfast each day one block down the lane where all the locals would eat on their way to work. As well there are several little convenience stores to grab some beer and chips as well as some good fruit shops all within that same part of the lane.We found lots of local eateries in the small streets that run off Nanjing Lu. Those resturants on Nanjing Lu were very expensive but where the locals eat off the mall are very good value.The location had to be the best part. Just thirty paces off Nanjing Lu which is the main pedestrian shopping mall, with a Metro stop on the corner, a 5 minute walk to the Bund and about the same to Peoples Square in the other direction.We noticed that Intrepid Tours puts its tour groups up at the Nanjing Hotel and its easy to see why. Mar 28 2006	Very central.	A nice hotel in the heart of Shanghai. Close to subway and close to the Bund. Nice and clean rooms with a good city view. Reasonable priced. Jan 26 2006	Great location	Clean, comfortable, large rooms with english speaking staff just off Nanjing Road, 5 mins to Bund. Underground train just around the corner. Excellent local restaurants opposite the hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel but was told it was v. ordinary. Turn right out of hotel and head 1 block to find small supermarket, 1 more block and you'll find good, cheap laundry. Also great breakfast snacks in this area. No hairdryer in the room but one available in reception if you can get it. Recommend taking your own. Oct 24 2005	Great location	This is a nice hotel in a great location, just next to Nanjing Rd and only 10minutes walk to The Bund. Although not 5 star it is very clean with friendlyEnglish speaking staff. I would recommend this for anyone and it is a good price also. Nov 9 2021	??????… Jul 10 2021 	Convenient location. Just average Jun 19 2021 	un timo!..... un 0 sobre 10000 May 20 2008 	moyen pas de clim"
"Sep 24 2021 	Really nice	It was a great surprise when we discovered thar our 30€ bedroom was a deluxe one with King size bed and a fantastic view. It's really close to the Bund and the city center, in really wlaikng distances, not like they say in other places... I'd really reccomend it. The best hotel in our 10 days trip in China! Aug 27 2021 	Big average OK hotel	Entering the hotel it looks all a bit shabby, the service is OK, just what it takes, but the rooms are modern, the tab with the extra knob for drinking water is interesting and the location is great; cross the brigde and you are almost on the Bund. Have breakfast for the view not for the food; after I had seen the view I avoided it. Aug 22 2021 	VERY unpleasant staff	This is a very good value hotel, rooms are spacious and clean and location is excellent, yet I have rarely found such unpleasant staff in a hotel worldwide!!! They seem unable to smile and totally annoyed by questions relating to ANY topic. If you insist upon asking for information on the city, you will end up getting a tiny piece of paper with some words scrubbled in Chinese and no one will ever bother explain what they mean (you're supposed to show the piece of paper to taxi drivers, etc). All this refers to ALL employees and managers working in this hotel, both at the reception and in the businness office.Also, once you're out through the main entrance, you will systematically get harassed by people trying to take you to local markets and literally following you in the street until you get really upset and have to yell at them to leave you alone! Why isn't anyone at the hotel doing anything to keep these people away? Aug 11 2021 	HORRIBLE STAFF with TERRIBLE BREAKFAST and ROOM	We were here for 3 Nights and we have book a business room with double bed, at the first sight everything looks ok from outside....and then we were in the Lobby...the Staff were very impolite and couldn't speak English...the bell boy face look like if we smelled bad and very rude to us...Positive: Location is near to Nanjing Lu , can be reach by TaxiNegative:1. very rude, impolite Staff 2. the room smell strange and damp3. the breakfast is poor and please go outside to take your breakfast, you will not miss the breakfast in Hotel...and too expensive for the food and serviceAVOID THIS HOTEL! Jul 21 2021	Worst hotel ever stayed in	Where to start, thats the problem.The staff are ignorant and rude. I was stood waiting to check out and it took them 20 minutes to even acknowledge that i was stood in the lobby. Room service was appaling, i ordered food from there and it took almost an hour for them to send it up, by that time i was no longer hungry. And they add a tip themselves without even checking if thats okay with you.THEY ALSO CONNED ME.The staff were dishonest.I wanted to change 50GBP into chinese RMB, roughly 500yuen. And i pocketed the money thinking I could trust them. But when i went to pay for something the next day, i noticed that it was not yuen, but it was infact Taiwaneze dollars. (100 yuen=£10 100TaiwanezeD=£2) This meant that i lost £40. I then went and complained to them, and they refused to hand back a single penny. They denied everything. THIS HOTEL CANNOT BE TRUSTED!The bedding was not made, the bathroom was unclean. the wardrobe was too small to even fit hangers in it.I would not recommend this hotel to ANYONE. Apr 30 2021 	Luxurious room for a bargain-basement price	Several reviewers here reported on poor-quality rooms -- but my room here in April 2021 was of 4 or 5-star quality, and nearly as nice as the Park Prince in Tokyo I'd been in the previous week. The interior finish was beautiful and in perfect condition, and the linens and bedcovers were luxury quality. It may be that there are some sub-standard rooms; if you happen to get one of these, ask for better. The neighborhood right around the hotel doesn't have much happening, but it isn't far, -- an inexpensive cab ride or walk, -- from the fashionable tourist areas. For the price I thought this hotel was a very good value. Apr 23 2021	Price and location OK food and service poor	We came with a tour and I had tried to get a 2 night extension online 6 weeks before but they didn't respond at all after several attempts. So we decided to wait till we got there with the group. No problem getting extra nights. Room was nice no great view and of course noisy street outside - no big deal use earplugs if you want the window open for fresh air. No a/c in roomBeds hardest we had experienced in China - Hong Kong and Mexico hard! There is a security light on the inside of the door that has a mind of its own and comes on and off intermittently all night. There is no possible way to turn it off so take eye shades. The bath tub is deep and very slippery so one needs to be very careful. We asked for a non slip mat but they don't have them.Food was poorest of all the places we ate over 3 weeks They do not set places at the table, the coffee and tea were well stewed and disgusting. The buffet breakfast was all lukewarm even early in the morningThe staff at reception were curt and rude and not in the least bit helpful. We asked about things in the neighbourhood but they either didn't understand or didn't know.The rooms were clean and the towels good, there was a kettle and tea and drinking water tap. I have stayed in other 3 star hotels that had more helpful staff and better food. Mar 2 2021 	Fantastic for price paid	I was amazed at what under £20 a night can buy you. The room was of a high standard, very clean. It was a little small but they did have larger rooms. The lobby is spacious and you can get around town by taxi easily and cheaply. The service is not great, they seem to have a large desk with different sections you should use but I stood there for minutes and the staff had the heads down and I was basically ignored. I was eventually served and English was spoken by most staff. They made a mistake with my bill and double charged me but they did apologise and rectify the situation before I had even noticed it. Ignore the touts outside the hotel wanting you to go to their shops! The main shopping street is about a ten minute walk but be warned as a tourist you will get constant hassle from people selling watches, dvd etc. Feb 24 2021	it was tolerable	It's really cheap and not a bad cab ride. But except for cheap wares and shabby restaurants there's not much nearby. Also, the rooms are tiny with stained sheets, tiny closets (not deep enough for hangers) and a dingy bathroom. The hotel massage parlor appears to be prostitutes - I didn't check it out myself, but there was a sketchy guy in the lobby handing out cards with girls in bikinis. And the girls looked like hookers when I saw them in the hallways. Also the place smells like an ashtray and left all my clothes smelling like an ashtray. The fitness center and business center were so bad the might as well not be there at all. Feb 23 2021 	With this low price what can you complain about?	With this low price at RMB216 (subject to a 10% charge, totally RMB238) per night, I am very satisfied with this hotel even though it has some downsides:1. In the middle of the night, I could sometimes hear people in the next room talking and also I could hear the door bell in a neighbour room rang. I believe it not only attributes to the thinner walls, but the uncontrolled voices of people (as many local Chinese do);2. The bathroom wall facing the bedroom is made of glass with a venetian blind outside. The venetian blind cannot be totally closed up, so if you are sharing the room with non-lovers, it will be so embarrasing (luckily I travel alone this time).All other provisions are excellent: clean and large room, hot and strong shower with bath tub, slippers toothpaste toothbrush shower cap shampoo bath gel bed sheets renewed everyday (which I don't think necessary for environment saving), safe (I walked back to hotel alone after 10pm), good location of 10 minutes walk to Nanjing East Road and Metro Station, staff normal, smooth reservation via venere.com.Bonus: A drinkable water tap apart from the usual water tap on the sink, electric water pot, hair dryer, safe deposit box.Some reviewers said there are nothing in the neighbourhood besides mobile phones, electronics shops. Actually there is a small shopping mall in the north of the hotel along the Sichuan Road, about 4 minutes walk away.Shanghai is my new favour for weekends or short vacations where there is no need to make up or dress up, so you can just relax. It's full of creation and fun.Back to the hotel, it worths much more than it costs. I've just been to Paris in January. With the same provisions, it at least costs Euro 100 in Paris. Nov 10 2008	New Asia Was Awesome	I stayed at the New Asia with my high school on a cultural tour earlier this year. It was by far the best hotel I stayed in whilst in China. The staff were friendly, it was close to good shopping, and the breakfast was great. They do however need a larger seating area in the breakfast buffet - my friends and I usually had to sit at other peoples tables due to the lack of free ones.Otherwise, a great experiece. Sep 30 2008 	Just fine for $50/night	The people that dogged this hotel obviously did not think through what you get for $50/night. If you are looking for a bed that's comfy enough, a location that is central enough (especially considering taxis to most places are $2-$3), and a hotel that's clean enough for $50 a night, then the New Asia is just fine. The front desk speaks english and they were plenty helpful to me. The breakfast is even pretty decent for a couple of days at about $4.50, it just gets tiresome eating the same thing for breakfast every day. If you are high maintenance or want a 5 star hotel at a 3 star price then go elsewhere. As far as women of the night, I was approached by a man trying to sell &quot;massages&quot; at 3am one night, but that can be expected in a lot of places at 3am in Shanghai.Also, my advice to find the hotel (which was a bit difficult without a good map) is to take the Maglev, switch to the metro and get off at East Nanjing Rd-that way you don't have to switch lines. Head East on Nanjing (away from the Bund and the river) about 2 blocks then turn left (north) on Sichuan and walk about another 4-5 blocks. The hotel is just over a bridge on your left at Tiantong rd. Hope this helps. Mar 28 2008 	Good location	Stayed here as a family at the end of a month long trip travelling China. This hotel is fairly central - just a short walk from Nathan Road (over one bridge) and close to shopping and restaurants. The hotel is a clean, 3 star property. Nothing amazing but basic and clean. Beware of rip-off taxi drivers if you get them from the front door - we had one not put on the metre and overcharge us to take us out to an acrobats show. Mar 25 2008 	Avoid at all costs.......	I was on group tour with other students from Portland State University. This 'hotel', actually more of a brothel, was awful. Rooms were dirty, bathroom shower had paint peeling off the tiels, ventilation was inadequate, 'women of the night' were prowling throughout the hotel, the massage area was actually a front for a prostitution operation. This hotel is unsatisfactory for overnight stays.......many better options out there...... Mar 14 2008 	Very Satisfied	We booked this hotel through internet and was desperate to get here because it actually had a laundry service. We had just come back from Suzhou and Hangzhou and in comparison to the hotels we stayed in those two cities, New Asia Hotel was so much nicer. I liked it from the moment we got off the cab cuz they actually had a bellboy serving us. We saw many foreigners at the lobby and felt secure at instant. The room we stayed at (545) was very nice. They had just re-furnished the room and there was a plasma TV with movie channels(you have to pay about 20-80rmb depending on which movie tho) . Their services were quite satisfying. Laundry service, mini-bar in the room, you can see the bathroom from the bedroom, its like a japanese love hotel. a high-class one. lol the furnitures are made of dark wood and they look modern and classy. The amenities are clean and descent too. We ordered some room service just for the kick of it to see if it's any good. To our surprise, the stir-fried rice was very tasty and the other dishes were yummy too. The breakfast was amazing as well. It is located quite near the bund so we are going to take a walk today but to be honest i just wanna stay in! i'm definately staying here again if i ever come back to shanghai, although it's quite unlikely considering the air pollution and the fact that shanghai people is snobby and they are always trying to rip us off because we are tourists. Highly recommend Hangzhou for a trip. It's beautiful there and the air is so much cleaner. People are very civilized and nice. Mar 3 2008 	Proceed with caution	I booked a room for two nights through elong.com--I think about $35/night--and chose this hotel for its good location and inexpensive rate. I wasn't expecting much. I planned to stay two nights, but actually decided to leave after one night. My room was tiny, dingy (not just a little old but also not really clean), and smelled so strongly of really acrid smoke that my bag still smelled like smoke days later. I woke up and my hair and pj's also reeked. UGH! I would suggest staying here if location + super-cheap-price are your only concerns. Also, I was traveling alone and there wasn't a deadlock or other manual lock from the inside, which creeped me out. Actually, the hotel kind of seemed like a set from a 70s horror movie (but maybe I just got creeped out and then had The Shining on my mind). EVEN SO, it didn't ruin my time in Shanghai--my new favorite city. I can't wait to return...and shell out for someplace a little nicer. Dec 27 2007 	Better than I expected	My friend and I booked a standard twin room for 3 nights. The quality was better than we expected at this cheap price. The room was clean and the beds were quiet comfortable. The location is quite near the city centre, Nanjing Road which we could walk there by around 15 mins. Surprisingly, there are some nice small local food shops around the hotel. FiFi, Italy Oct 23 2007	Very nice hotel	We stayed here for two nights as part of a group tour. We were told not to expect much but the hotel was actually very nice. It is an old hotel with art deco features inside with only 8 floors. The restaurant is on the top floor. We had a nice room overlooking the electricity cables outside, but it did not matter as we only slept there. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. There is a lot of dark wood everywhere so it is a bit dark.The area around the hotel is not that exciting and somehow we ended up walking around the red light district looking for somewhere to eat! The main shopping centre is about 1 km away and the Bund about 10 mins walk.The night we arrived there were three weddings on in the hotel and we could not get anything to eat which was a bit of a pain, but breakfast was very nice.Shanghai is even bigger than Beijing but more people speak English and there is a bit more Western influence in the city so it was a bit easier to go out on your own. Sep 30 2007 	Okay Stay at New Asia	Stayed in New Asia Hotel as part of a package tour of China. The hotel was by far the worst we stayed in during the whole trip, but still wasn't that bad. The room itself was large and clean and at least had a safe in th room. The real down side to the whole hotel was the choice of drinks in the bar. No wine and no vodka which I just couldn't believe. It forced us to get out of the hotel anyway and there is certainly choice to be had elsewhere. Aug 23 2007 	worst hotel with dishonest staff	i am a frequent traveller. i have stayed in many hotels but none is as worst as this. the staff are all dishonest. Beware of your belongings if you want them to clean your room or check whether they give you a fake note when changing your currency. Ban internet connection. Manager has no basic service manners. overall, i say this is the worst hotel in shangai. they dun even deserve 3 stars Aug 8 2007 	Nice hotel good location no problems at all	My stay here was organised through the tour company I was traveling with and I was more than happy with their choice. The room was comfortable, spacious and was nice and clean. Rooms were serviced daily, so no problems. I did stay on here for a couple of days after the tour finished and felt very safe and comfortable. I had a room on one of the higher levels and had a view looking out to city. It was lovely at night. Being on a main street, it was a little noisy but nothing overly horrible that I couldn't sleep.Breakfast was included and being a westerner in a eastern country, it was quite an experience. Luckily by the time we got to Shanghai we were used to the 'western style' breakfasts. Spam has never looked so good :-) hehehe... It's not exactly what were be used to, but it is fine to get you by. It was appreciated that they made an effort to cater for us. Hey, your in a foreign country so can't complain really.The staff were ok. I found the same attitude with every hotel we stayed at. They spoke very limited English and were abit abrupt, but I think that's just how they are. Often they would find a staff member that could speak English and help you out. We were lucky enough to have an English speaking guide traveling with us, so she was our last resort. Location - not too bad. Was about a half hour (slow) walk to the Bund. Taxi's are always at the front door to take you where ever you need to go and are quite reasonably priced. There are major retail shops just around the corner and Nanjing Road isn't far in a taxi. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as a clean, comfortable place to stay. Oct 1 2006 	perfectly adequate	I booked this hotel through elong.net. I was mostly driven by price- it seems hard to get something below 300 RMB in Shanghai. We had a double room with attached bath.I thought the hotel was perfectly adequate- not the Hilton but for this price i don't expect the Hilton. Reception staff was helpful and spoke good english. we used the business center to book train tickets and to surf the web and all went well.I never eat in Hotel restaurants so cannot comment on the food there. 1 block away is a busy alley (Zhapu Lu) full of restaurants and shops and foot massage places- convenient. there are convenience stores within 50m from the hotel and we never had any problem finding a taxi.If you are looking for an affordable place to stay I surely would recommend New Asia. Sep 1 2006 	Fading glory in China	Located on a busy street corner, 10-15 mins walk from the tourist haven that is the Bund, The New Asia Hotel foyer is impressive. However our double room felt like it belonged to a different hotel. Definitely in need of renovation, the carpet was old and stained, the double bed was small and had seen better days, the shower took its time to heat up and the bathroom could do with some quality time with a scrubbing brush and some bleach.The staff were polite, but only as helpful as they absolutely had to be, don't expect much help with maps or suggestions of where to eat. Check out was a bit stressful with lots of people behind the desk, but only 2 people allowed to handle check out and the excessive amount of paperwork required to effect this.We stayed in their cheapest level of room and saw in the door of some rooms that seemed to be more modern than ours. Also, the room rate we got was competitive. Sep 1 2006 	What are you looking for?	Yes.. what are you looking for?In August, we were looking for a budget hotel, not too far from the Bund, 3/4 stars.. after having seen at a lot of hotels from a chinese web site with very good discounts, we booked this hotel for three night.The rate was 26 euro / room / night, standard room, and, in Shanghai, is a really good price. The hotel is an &quot;old style&quot; building, 15 minutes walking from Bund. We were given 8th floor room, small, queen bed, but prepared for one (I think they gave us a single room used as double). No view (in front of the hotel they were building something), but, even if small, the room was ok.. good air conditioned and clean.The only problem was a little &quot;smell&quot; of wet, which was reduced in a few hours keeping the air condition at max speed.We had a some problems with the employers: they were really rude, very poor English, and every our request seemed to annoy them. For example, I went to the receptionist asking her if she could write in chinese an address for the taxi driver.. I've been answered &quot;Give me your Passport&quot;. &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Passport&quot;. She didn't help me untill she verified I was a hotel guest.Breakfast (3 euro), was ok, nothing special, both chinese (75%) and continental (25%) but good to give you energy for the long day.The street itself is not Nanjing Road (no shops, no restaurant), but you can find everything in 10 minutes walking. We come back walking at 11:30 pm, but we felt safe and we had no problem. Anyway, remember that a taxi can take you anywere for about 1 or 2 euros (Pudong is 2,5 euro)I did not try the hotel restaurant ( I avoid them on holiday), so I cannot give my opinion.Well, if you are a budget traveller, looking for a place to sleep, safe, clean, location ok, this is the hotel for you. If you are a family, with child, or a businnes traveller, probably you should find something else (even if the deluxe rooms could be larger and more confortable). Jun 3 2006 	Great location cheap room rate	Right bang on Nanjing Rd Pedestrian area, so road traffic noise no real problem. Comfortable room and hotel seems to have been recently refurbished . Managed to get a great online room rate from (--). BUT beware , the very cheapest rooms have no windows!!. As we where staying a week the extra RMB60 per day was well worth it. If you have the energy you could probably bargain this down a bitCheaper rooms not overly large but adequate and we where only back in the hotel for sleep. Literally 10 -15 minutes walk to Bund, Peoples square , Shangahi museum. Did not use the hotel restaurant as so many great and cheap restaurants all around. Mojo Coffee down Nanjing Rd aways provided morning caffiene fix.Hotel staff helpful and English pretty good at reception. Note that they would not provide and iron to press clothes - you have to send out to laundry service- which was cheap and great service but not so great when I needed to iron a clean shirt for a busniess meeting!Major Hint-- - make sure you take and empty suitcase to Shanghai as YOU WILL buy stuff! If you are staying in Shanghai, you may as well stay right in the action and from RMB 300 per night the price is right! Jun 3 2006 	Not the best place	I have experiences with other cheap but good hotels in Shanghai but wanted to stay near the Bund this time for the fun of it. So I decided to stay at the New Asia Hotel which I found through the Trip Advisor website.This hotel is in the eastern side of Shanghai and the good things about the hotel are: (i) its not far from the Bund (ii) its not very expensive (iii) the rooms were small but clean (but mine had no view what soever.) (iv) the hotel felt quite safe.The not so good things are: (1) the immediate neighbourhood around the hotel is not very interesting or attractive (seems to have a concentration of shops selling hardware and industrial products); (2) the hotel restaurant is not great and you would have to walk a good 10 minutes or more to decent restaurants which can be a hassle if its raining coz taxis are also more difficult to come by during peak hours when it rains (isn't it like this the world over??); (3) the Hotel is dfinitely NOT within walking distance to the nicer areas of shanghai such as hengshan lu area, a leafy area which was formerly part of the French and German concession (so I was told) where most of the consulates are located and where there are lots of nice restaurants, bars etc) (4) the hotel is NOT near the business and financial area which around the Portman RitzCarlton area (could be 45 minutes by cab during peak hours) (5) it is not near the Yu Yuen and Lao Shanghai Jie and other places frequented by tourists which are further south (could be 20 minutes by cab during peak hours);(6) it is not near Xin Tian Di, a happening place for bars and such in Shanghai. The worst thing about New Asia Hotel is that you have to pay for internet access. It's one of those strange things in Shanghai that you can usually get free high speed broad band access in a cheap hotel but have to pay for it if you are staying in an expensive hotel (like the Shangri La or equivalent). Perhaps I'm the one at fault, but I've stayed in other cheap but good hotels in Shanghai and Beijing and never had to pay for broadband access so I was shocked to be told it was chargeable. Broad band access was about US$8.00 per day.As I travel to Shanghai in part for business and in part for fun, I will not staying at the New Asia Hotel again. Jan 22 2006 	A decent enough cheap option	I stayed here for 5 nights, leaving on the 13th of Jan. Pretty good location - only 10 mins from the Bund - decent price, v.good breakfast, though the food in the restaurant itself was below average. In fact the restaurant has no character at all. Best to get out and about for food. The facade of the hotel is being cleaned, so my room, and most others, have no view at all of the street outside. I opened the curtains in the morning to find just a tarpaulin drawn across. Didn't hear much noise from the workmen though. The cleaning will go on until mid-february, which is certainly a negative, but i think that online prices are lower than normal because of this. Dec 20 2005 	Nice rooms lousy food	An OK hotel with lousy breakfast. The location of the hotel and condition of the room were excellent. Jul 29 2005	Good hotel with great breakfast	The twin room I stayed in was fairly large, clean and in good condition. The hotel itself is close to several good shopping streets, and lots of bars and restaurants. The best bit of the hotel though is the breakfast, with a wide range of both Chinese and Western style foods. Nov 5 2021 	n ai pas aime Sep 28 2021 	????????

"Nov 24 2021 	excellent hotel	the room are very well equiped and very clean ; the decoration is nice and the bed is very confortoable. This is really a top hotel and the area is nice for small shops and restaurant where you can eat typical chinese food. the hotel is nevertheless far from the city center but with cab this is not too much of a problem. Breakfast buffet is amazing and provide a great choice of excellent products Nov 5 2021 	Modern Hotel excellent value.	Couldn't fault the Novotel Atlantis. A very modern hotel with excellent amenities and friendly helpful staff.The rooms were very spacious well kept and clean.The hotel is within walking distance of the train station. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again if visiting Shanghai again in the future. Sep 29 2021 	Good hotel let down by poor lighting in bathroom	Stayed here 1 night on the 37th floor. Big flat screen TV but no BBC (is it coincidence that it is a French hotel chain!) – no Sleep facility. Separate purpose-built spacious shower and bath. Very poor lighting in bathroom, particularly in front of mirror over sink. Not 5 star, but certainly 4 star.Revolving restaurant on 50th floor – excellent views over Shanghai – where had a seafood buffet. Part of hotel seemed to be closed – descended from lift and found ourselves in the deserted part with two bemused security guards looking at us. They soon gestured us out of the building and into the main street where, after 10-20 metre walk, we were soon back in the main hotel. Glorious view over Shanghai from hotel room. Despite being so high up, lifts were very quick.About 40 minutes from the Pudong international airport (150 yuan by taxi). Sep 26 2021 	Very nice hotel.	We stayed at this hotel for 11 nights. we had very nice and big room. there is a free internet in all rooms in this hotel. rooms were cleaned every day. the hotel has a nice swimming pool with a view to the city. Also there are some good restaurants.You can catch a taxi to go to the city center. Or use a metro which is 4 minutes walk from the hotel. Jul 29 2021 	Overall a very good hotel	I stayed here for 2 nights before heading back to Canada from a 4 week trip of China &amp; Malaysia. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect but what I found exceeded my expectations. We arrived on the red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur and much to our surprise, we were able to check in right away (9am). Also, we were given free internet access (which was not included in the price) &amp; late checkout without any hassles. The hotel lobby was nice and spacious.I must say, the service was impeccable. Housekeeping was already in our room before we arrived to set up the rollaway bed and provided lots of extra anemities without being asked. We got a corner room which was more spacious and even with an extra bed, there was lots of room for our suitcases. The only downside is the location. It's in the business district of Pudong and not even close to a subway station. The nearest one was at least a 15 min walk away which seems like an eternity when it's over 40 degrees outside. You definately need to take a cab to get anywhere. Luckily there was a Starbucks next door which was handy.In all, I was very satisifed with this hotel and would stay here again. Jun 16 2021 	Basic business hotel	very basic business hotel. decent clean rooms. in the heart if pudong. 10 min away from thr maglev to shanghai airport. reasonably priced. starbucks in the adjoining lobby.. Jun 6 2021 	Very good hotel	Been at that hotel for 4 days. Hotel's allure is great. The restaurants are interesting and serve good choices and tasty cuisine. Service is quick and with a smile. Location is not an issue. From Pudong airport, taking high speed train + taxi = 30 minutes max. This way, you avoid the cranky taxis. Internet in the room works well. Feb 27 2021 	Nice modern unpretentious hotel	I liked it a lot. Modern, efficient hotel with good health club facilities. Well located for Pudong business area. I am becoming a fan of this brand. Nice looking restaurants on site. Feb 15 2021 	Novotel Atlantis Shanghai	I stayed at the Novotel Atlantis for four days and overall the hotel is OK. Is far away from the Pudong Airport but its relatively close to Puxi and the Pudong city centre. The hotel is actually close to quite a few food places and you need to be adventurous and walk around the city and check out the places to eat. The hotel staff are ok. Some spoke good english but some staff in concierge lacked a bit in their English. If you need to go to Puxi I would suggest catching a cab as its relatively cheap. Taxi from airport to the hotel i about 125Yuan. Feb 4 2021 	Good choice for Business travellers	My company liked to put me and my colleagues here in this hotel because it's reasonably priced and it's close to our office. Their suite is fairly big with a living room and separate bedroom.The only knock on this hotel is definitely location. It's not within walking distance from the public transportation routes including subway. I recalled one occasion where we went out for dinner one night, it started to snow heavily and we couldn't find a taxi to take us back to the hotel. At the end, we called the hotel and the conciege staff was kind enough to send a taxi over to bring us back. Of course we were already frozen to death having waited on the cold street for almost an hour. Jan 23 2021 	Not bad	Not the cheapest stay, but it doesn't look cheap. Most of the staff were nice but not easy to communicate with. You have to speak simply and slowly. We didn't have a problem with the non-smoking room smelling of cigatette smoke, but 2 other guests told us they did. As well as some guests smoking in non-smoking areas, we saw several who didn't seem to have any respect for the hotel or other guests, even like spitting and discarding half-eaten candy on the floor. I wonder how the hotel will look in a few years if guests are allowed to not follow rules like that? Dec 21 2018 	If only distant wasnt the factor	Upon reading the previous reviews, i was quite worried. Most of the negative reviews are that it is quite far from the actions. I am visiting shanghai for 9 nights and stayed in Novotel Atlantis for 3 of it. I didnt really care whether the hotel will be far or not because I have another 6 nights in Westin right in the centre of town.Let me tell you this. It is not as far as i would have imagined from reading the reviews.I got a perfect room on the 37th floor, a corner room. Absolutely perfect view of the Shanghai Pudong Skyline (from the back) on one side and the commercial ports on the other.The checkin was rather annoying, considering i have already given them a call that i will be arriving at about 1am. That didnt bother me much though.The room was beautiful, spacious (maybe its the corner room) and as i said, with a beautiful view.Room service food was of good quality. House keeping really leaves you alone with the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign on, which is what look for in any hotel.On my second day, I went up to the Art50 Restaurant on the top floor, which is a revolving restaurant. The food was ok, a seafood buffet, i am not a big fan of seafood, and i dont know why i go for it.But i think to seafood lovers it might be great, I'll leave that for you people to comment.At the dinner, the Director of Food and Bev noticed that i was having dinner alone (I was travelling alone), he came by to greet me. Talked to him for a while and i must say he is a very understanding and professional in hospitality issues.Oh, and he ordered a good pint of beer for me, on the house, which is always welcoming to any Aussie.Upon my departure day, i went down for breakfast at 2nd Deck Cafe. The Breakfast were nice, they cook egg on the spot for you. I reckon the bread could be better, it can get rock hard.Staff at the breakfast service were rather less friendly, and rarely smile, but that didnt really bother me. One good thing, they were very quick to remove your used plates, which is a real plus.Check out were quick and pleasant. The bellboy was quick to get to the room, and the Reception staff were very quick in processing. Further more, He did make sure that i quoted the correct A-Club Membership number.Overall, it was a pleasant stay. If you werent looking for a hotel right in the heart of town, then Novotel could be the hotel of choice. I would have to agree with most previous reviews about the hotel being abit out of the way, but fortunately for me, as i said, it wasn't part of the factor to consider for this stay. I would love to come back to this hotel again. Recommended for service. Nov 10 2018 	What A Disaster	The other reviews point out this hotels unfavourable location. It is removed from shops, restaurants and anything that would give a visitor thr feeling of being in Shanghai. The rooms a clean and well maintained but the staff have limited English for foreign visitors. It is a hotel without a sense of place. I did not try their premier restaurant on the top floor but hosted business guests to the rather expensive 118 yuan buffet on the second floor and was left embarrased by the poor quality of the food and the confussed selection. Another review warned about the in-room massage in which &quot;extras&quot; are offered - be warned - not a good look for Accor the operator. Another warning; I booked on the Accor website and when there was a problem the Assist Front Office Mgr produced a print-out with my full credit card number, my name and the security three digit code from the back of the card - a security nightmare. There are plenty of better alternatives that will give visitor a sense of the excitement that is Shanghai. Sep 16 2018 	Good mid-range hotel	This is a nice hotel with friendly staff. The room was fine with cable tv, fridge and the bottled water came in handy (although it was cheap to buy in the city as well). The hotel is a bit out of the tourist area, with the walk to the river taking about 40 minutes. However, pudong dadao runs outside the hotel and is a major rd so you can easily get a bus, or a taxi from the hotel, which are very cheap. A taxi to nanjing donglu (major shopping area over the river) costs about 25RMB which is very cheap in western money. Even the taxi from the airport was only the equivalent of $20 for a 1 hour ride. However, the taxi drivers go fast and drive to their own rules so buckle up! Also, there is a metro station 1 block away and the trains are great in Shanghai (although crowded). The breakfast is standard western/asian hot buffett and Olive's restaurant was good (and cheap). Make sure you learn some basic Chinese before you come or ask the staff to write down the hotel name in Chinese to give to taxi drivers. I found very few people (and hardly any taxi drivers) spoke English. The people in Shanghai are however very friendly and accommodation and you can get along fine with a smile and laugh. May 30 2018	Hotel assessment	I stayed for a week at the Novotel Atlantis in Pudong. The location is more suited to business people than tourists. However the rate was much cheaper (around $50/night cheaper) than for hotels in the city centre (eg the Bund). A taxi to the Bund costs about 20 yuan ($3). So for a 10 minute trip it was a reasonable trade off. A subway station is one block away for even cheaper transport. The hotel room was as expected for 4 star. Restaurants in the hotel were disappointing but typical for Shanghai. (The Hyatt's highly rated restaurant cost me $300 for 2 and was much inferior to Hong Kong standards.) The standard of food hygiene at Novotel appeared good however. The breakfast buffet was quite good. The hotel gives you a litre of bottled water every day which is essential in Shanghai. Travel advice from the concierge or other staff was really unavailable due to their extemely limited English ability. Not even brochures were available. Most other guests were Europeans so English may not be in demand much. Conclusion: would stay there again but with lower expectations. Jan 29 2018	I suspect you can find better in Shanghai	The rooms are nice enough but the hotel is not the best run Novotel in Asia. You might want to avoid the hotel restaurants as they are pretty hopeless. The independent Chinese restaurant just outside the main entrance to the left is vastly superior and is an impressive destination. After some 10 days of meetings and travellng I thought a nice massage, steam and sauna might be in order. Unfortunately the massage girl got a bit upset when I declined the 'Special Massage'. Very disappointing to end up in this scenario in a major brand hotel. If this is not your thing then best avoided.The Sofitel Pudong was classier and not very much more expensive, I will stay there in future. Sep 17 2007 	Nice hotel in shanghai	We stayed at this hotel on (23 &amp; 24 August) and booked the hotel through the hotel website. The down side to this hotel is that it is quite far away from downtown Shanghai and that there is not much to see or do near the hotel, there is a subway about 15 minutes walk away or you need to use taxis.On the positive side the hotel is very clean, with very friendly and knowledgeable staff who speak good english. The rooms are modern and of a very high standard, the rooms higher up have great views of the river. the hotel has a pool and plenty of restaurants and bars. special mention for the very helpful concierge staff.overall very good hotel and good value for money, pity about the distance from downtown. Aug 24 2007	A good Hotel in Pudong	I stayed in this Hotel several times during last year and my general opinion is very positive....nice modern rooms with great view if they are on high floors, good restaurants, and very nice bar on the 50th floor (turning around slowly and giving excellent view to Shanghai by night...No serious problems except that is in Pudong area and not so close to the centre of Shanghai (need taxi) Apr 17 2007 	Nice comfortable hotel but inconvenient uninteresting location.	I stay at this hotel whenever my company sends me to Shanghai for business. It is certainly a good hotel for business especially if you’re doing business in the Pudong area. However, I would not recommend this for tourists simply because it is far or at least inconvenient to get to the central and more interesting neighborhoods of the city, like the Bund or Nanjing Road. You’ll have to take a taxi or subway to get anywhere. Sometimes, it’s hard to get a taxi during rush hour or when it’s raining! Besides, there’s really nothing interesting within walking distance around the hotel’s neighborhood, certainly not restaurants, cafes, or shopping. The hotel has a fairly large lounge/bar and a business lounge on the 48th floor. Rooms are spacious, especially the “de luxe” rooms. They are well-lit, have light colored modern furnishings, very clean, and have ample closet space. Most, if not all rooms have birds-eye views of the city, beautiful especially at night! Beds are firm, almost too firm, pillows are thin, and towels not very plush but they do supply a bathrobe, slippers, and complimentary bottled water. Nice touch with the fresh rose on the pillow at turndown and rose petals floating in the toilet! The hotel’s gym is not very big but well-equipped. The restaurants are adequate but I would not recommend eating there if you don’t have to, not good value for the money and the quality of food is inconsistent at best. But the breakfast buffet is not bad, a good variety of dishes. Overall, the hotel is good value for the money if you don’t mind the location being inconveniently away from the city center and attractions. Feb 21 2007 	Great Hotel	My husband and I and another couple stayed at the Novotel Atlantis the first week of Feb 2007. I did not book the hotel, my friend did, and I was very concerned after reading reviews on this site.We all had excellent experiences. Upon arrival we were upgraded to business class at no extra charge to us. Our rooms were small but well appointed and had everything you could need. The beds were hard, but we ordered an extra duvet and put it under us. The bedding and pillows were very comfortable. The rooms were spotless, and we recieved turn down service every night. We were brought 2 fresh roses every night, and when they do the turn down service, they also tidy the bathroom and put rose petals in the toilet. The rooms have robes, irons, and all the comforts of home plus a few more. The toiletries were exceptional, with nothing left out.The restaurants were great. They were a little expensive, but the quality and selection were great. There was a small deli type restaurant, as well as two casual dining rooms, and the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor. There was also a lounge just off the lobby.Our every wish was catered to promptly and professionaly. I was dreading check out becuase I had read negative things here on this site. I went over the entire bill (6 nights and all meals) with a fine tooth comb and there were absolutely no mistakes. The couple we were travelling with had no problems either.The rooms had complimentary bottled water daily.The staff was very helpful and spoke English very well. The concierge and front end staff were especially helpful in directing taxi drivers for us, and providing us with notes in chinese to give to taxi drivers.It was about 15 min from major shopping, but we didn't mind because we got to see more of the city.I would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again myself. Everything exceeded my expectations, and believe me, I can be a fussy hotel guest.I almost forgot to mention the fabulous workout facility. It was a fully stocked gym. The change rooms have steam rooms and hot tubs. This was all complimentary. The pool was beautiful with lots of windows to oversee the city.I did find the spa services a little expensive, and did not ingulge. However, I am sure they were par with market value.Do not hesitate to stay here. It is definatley a business/corporate hotel. They know how to treat their guests with all the comforts of home, including western food. Have a great trip! Jan 8 2007 	Terrible service remote location never again	We read good reviews of the hotel, and we booked 4 nights in January 2007 through their hotel website. The hotel is far from all attractions of the city. There is absolutely nothing interesting around the hotel (other than a frienly local massage service opposite the entrance). Your best bet is to take a taxi to metro station and then a metro to city centre. You can of course take a taxi to the city, but the traffic is so bad that it would take you close to one hour, and the bets that you will be cheated by taxi driver is more than 50%. The hotel is a highrise building, so nice views especially at night, but rooms are simple, and in our room the heating was not working. However it took us one day and three different engineers to convince them that the heating was not working properly. After that, they changed our room, and the heating was fine, but by then we already got ill. Any service in the hotel is very very pricey and very bad. For example internet access was 4 yuans per minute (240 yuans or 24 euros per hour), and the connection was slow (apparently due to an earthquake in Taiwan). the same connection is 3 yuans PER HOUR in the city, and in 1 yuan per minute (60 yuans per hour) in a 5 star hotel in Shanghai. Also, the hotel double charged the bill when I booked through internet (apparently they had a problem with their VISA machine that day). Explaining the situation was a communication nightmare, as there are noone who speaks good English. Worse is that they think they understand! After hours of battling they agreed to contact the finance department who acknowedged the error, but I am still waiting for the refund. In short, I would never stay in this hotel again, and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Oct 8 2006 	Great value for your money	we have been 2 nights in october in this hotel and got a corner-room in the 41 th floor. we had a view to the jin mao tower and the bund. the room was very clean and comfortable. we booked over the accor-hotels.com webside and payed approx. 95 US-$ for one night.the staff is very helpful and friendly. the breakfast buffet is excellent, you can find something for europeans/americans or for asians.when you come from pudong airport take the magnetic train and then take a taxi to the hotel, it cost you approx. 3 US-$. when you go to the bund take also a taxi, its about 15 minutes and cost you approx. 2 US-S. Aug 30 2006 	Had a great stay at the Novotel	This was a typical novotel property. Clean and business like throughout. The rooms were simply and nicely appointed. Some great views from the upper floors including some spectacular views of the Jin Mao Tower - Shaghai's tallest building. The hotel is located in the Pudong district and is about a 20 min taxi ride from the main toruist areas of the The Bund. The good news is that the taxis in shangahi are very relaible and really cheap and you can get them from the front of the hotel. There really isn't much around the area as far as shops or restaurants. Ask the hotel and they will direct you to a couple of large shopping and restaurant complexes about 5 min taxi from the hotel. You might want to try dining at the revolving restaurant at the top of the hotel. I never did so can't comment, but the ride to the top is fun in a stomach churning glass elevator some 70 stories! The hotel had great indoor pool and spa facilities which we used quite a bit as well. Overall a good choice - though not in the heart of the tourist area. Jan 20 2006 	Not the best but hey its just a Novotel	This hotel is adequate for business travel.The lobby was just ok, a typical 3.5 - 4 star.The location was great for Pudong access, but terrible if your on holidays, 45mins from the French Con.The service was just average. Concierge was bad.If you dont speak Mandarin commuication will be a chore, but not impossible, I speak Mandarin, but tested out the staffs English skill, not to great.The room itself was typical of all novotels.I paid for a sedan transfer to the airport and ended up with a mini bus that was in need of retirement.Look this place didn't blow me away. If you don't have another option by all means stay here. But personally I think its highly overpriced for what it is. Nov 26 2005	enjoy my stay	Altho' not near to the shopping area and public transport, it is quiet and clean. Stay in deluxe room and asked for the city view. Taxi is still cheap and can get you anywhere. Aug 25 2005 	I'll stay here again.	Very good value for money. Clean, efficient and quite satisfactory in Pudong - everything one really needs. Seems to be popular with French tourists and unpretentious business travellers (that's me). I'm becoming a Novotel fan... . Jun 7 2005	great hotel in the pudong	I had a 4 day stay here recently. Rooms were lovely although windows a bit small. The conference facilities were great too. The position of the hotel is in the pudong which means for the markets and the bund you need to catch a taxi but it is very cheap at 2 euros for most rides! Stay and enjoy! Sep 24 2021 	ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo bellissimo hotel Aug 27 2021 	Hotel irréprochable cependant un peu éloigné de l'hyper centre Sep 12 2018 	Ein Novotel - nicht mehr ganz das neueste Aug 31 2007	Superbe hôtel - Vue imprenable sur Shanghai by night"
"Oct 14 2021 	Excellent Location and Service	First time to stay in this hotel. Location is excellent. 2 minutes walk to subway station and they have a excellent manned cab station (the person in charge of the cab stationis from the cab company)Room is smaller than expected but adequate. Excellent service in almost all areas including the coffee shop, the lounge bar, the Japanese restaurant, housekeeping, etc.Will come back if the price is right Aug 11 2021 	Better than before	This was my 2nd time to stay at Okura Garden.Room was renovated and became much better than before.Best in this hotel is not smelly water. I will stay here again when I save some money rather than stay at 5 star hotels. May 30 2021 	Value for money	i have been many times to this hotel excellent service but little bit costly laundry is really very costly other wise everything is ok Apr 27 2021 	Lovely hotel but poor value with uncomfortable beds and best avoided for Westerners	The historic luxury hotel in the old French club has one of the most beautiful hotel lounges you will ever see as well as a lovely garden and for a European the Japanese orientation adds a further exotic spice to your stay. Previous comments about the old decor really miss the point as it is exceptionally beautiful (be sure to look at the function rooms upstairs which are fine examples of art deco). Service too is excellent in the Japanese tradition. BUT it has some Japanese-style disadvantages too - very few staff speak significant English, the beds are as hard as the floors and it is very expensive. We stayed in a club room with access to the club lounge - a total waste of money as the room is not very comfortable, the staff were uninterested and there was little on offer, not even enough food for breakfast (and staff had too little English to understand when I complained). I would not recommend this hotel for Western travellers. Sep 15 2018	Nice hotel but a bit dated	I stayed at this hotel as part of a tour. I didn't know the history of this hotel until I came back home. At first glance, the hotel seemed like any other older hotels. However, as I walked around the first floor and saw the nice staircase, I knew this place must have been of some historical significance.The room itself was ok size, but I felt that the furniture, TV, and the bathroom were a bit dated. Since this is a Japanese chain, the appliances (TV, hairdryer) are from Japan. I did enjoy the heated Japanese bidet, a welcoming surprise when you go to the bathroom in middle of the night. I also enjoyed the bath salts provided in the bathroom.I thought the location is pretty convenient, close to the shopping district on Huaihai Road. It's also not too far from the Yu Garden, Nanjing Road, and Xintiandi -- just a quick tax ride. Jun 17 2018	Good Location	Good hotel good location all the staff were exellent we booked a Deluxe King Garden View room. Located close to shops and restaurants and the garden is a nice place to walk if you dont want to venture out late. May 23 2018 	Below average for 5 star	In the competitive Shanghai hotel marketplace, the 5 star Okura Garden ranks far below many other hotels of similiar class. The hotel suffers from being older and not as fresh as other properties in the city. The room was clean, contained all the amenities that you would expect in a 5 star hotel, and had a helpful staff. But, the room looked and felt dated as did the lobby and other common areas. Location was good and provided easy access to the city, airport and train station. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel but in Shanghai, there are much better choices for the money. May 2 2018 	Good hotel	We were at the Okura Garden during a week long business event. The hotel staff was very accomodating and helpful. The rooms were nice, clean, and well supplied. The Rose Garden restaraunt was adequate for breakfast. We enjoyed the local suggestions made by the concierge staff and they were very helpful in calling cabs and making arrangements for attractions.One of the benefits of this hotel is its proximity to many other ammentities. The subway is one block away as is a grocery store and a major shopping street.The location is one of the true strengths of this hotel! Apr 24 2018 	Quaint hotel refurbished from an old part of Shanghai	I like this quaint hotel for its preservation of the old French Club building, which has become most of the lobby and some of the shops and coffee house. The restoration was sensitively done, which shows through the details of the neo-classical style architecture and the decor choices e.g. the chandeliers, the tiles and marble used etc etc. You will feel a good piece of 1930s Shanghai in la belle epoque, something which excites me each time I go through the lobby.The rooms are a drab too old in my opinion. They look like trapped in 1980s style, with the carpets worn (but clean) and the TV set from my high school days! The bathroom was small, with no separate showers and the tap was reeking with rust and age. I thought the room which my colleague stayed in at the 22nd floor looked much better. I think the renovations have yet to be carried out to the lower-floor rooms, one of which I was staying in.Otherwise, the room's amenities were adequate. The toilet seat was an interesting electronic one, Japanese style, which sent out a jet of water each time I press a button. To wash the soil out of your you-know-what! Trust the Japanese to think of this!That the hotel was Japanese run was obvious from the moment you stepped in. The counter staff display a badge stating how proficient they are in the Japanese language, and the number of Japanese guests could have been in the hundreds. THere are also displays in Japanese throughout.SO being so Japanese means service levels should be higher than what you'd usually get in Shanghai. And for this, the hotel did not disappoint.Let me quote you an example: I asked for a big bed as that's my preference. They originally run out of such beds when I first booked, but I think they noted my preference and when I checked in, they allowed that for me. Nice touch and means so much to me.All in all, this hotel is a dated outfit with some parts crying out for an overhaul. But its software makes up for a lot of the wants in the hardware, and I think I will likely wish to return, especially to one of their renovated rooms. Apr 16 2018	Quiet clean a bit dated Japanese hotel in China	The Okura´s entrance is an architectural landmark in a very nice garden in a good area of Shanghai. The lobby is very well appointed and it is a pleasant place to be. Room was very clean all around, comfortable if a touch small and a bit dated. My TV was a very old Hitachi, I mean really old, almost a collectible. Cable reception was of poor quality perhaps for that reason. If you like quiet and don´t mind staying in a 1980s feel Japanese hotel, this might be your choice. Dec 9 2017 	Central and comfortable	Not a bad spot and recommended to me by a well travelled Japanese friend. In my case, the stay involved an overnighter after a 3 week business trip in China and so I appreciated the calm and cleanliness of the rooms, the view of the gardens - especially watching the people exercise in the morning, tea in the lobby lounge, an excellent sushi dinner and very good morning breakfast. I also enjoyed the elegant style of the place despite its occasional 1970's appearance tower block. Service was friendly and the porters were excellent.There are probably better places to stay in Shanghai but this hotel was central and comfortable. Nov 11 2017	Deep in the French Concession	The Okura Garden Hotel is top notch. The lobby area and public rooms are in the old French Club, which was the social center for the French expatriates living in the old French Concession. They have been beautifully restored, especially the lobby lounge. There is a lovely garden, actually a small private park, in front of the hotel. The hotel rooms are in a 33-story tower that has been added at the back (ala the Helmsley Palace Hotel in NYC). Our room(#2222) had a king-size bed and lots of storage space, but the sitting area was pretty tight. The bathroom was outstanding with plenty of counter space, a large square sink, a toilet with a heated 'bidet' seat, and a separate glassed-in room with a shower area in front of a tub with a window looking into the bedroom (for watching TV during your bubble bath? for putting on a show for your significant other?). Fortunately, for the more modest there was a venetian blind on that window.The lights for reading in bed were completely inadequate. The table lamps next to the bed are too dim, so you need the ceiling light in the center of the room to read a book or newspaper.High-speed internet is 120rmb per 24-hours. We had a problem with a loose connection and the hotel's tech guy was there to fix it immediately. The bell staff and room staff were all cheerful and spoke adequate English.The staff at the concierge desk communicated effectively in English and understood and responded to our needs. The front desk staff was a little less able to communicate. Room service dinners were excellent and the service was impeccable. The breakfast buffet was ample with plenty of choices of American-style food. Unfortunately there was always a line for tables.The hotel's location is a little bit remote from The Bund and People's Square area, but it is just two blocks from a very nice shopping street and taxis are cheap and plentiful all over the city.The Okura Garden is clearly a 5-star operation, well-managed, comfortable and sumptuous. Jun 15 2017	Okura Garden Hotel	The Okura is in a 1920's ish building, which is located in the French Concession area of Shanghai. The lobby area is well maintained and has a nice historic feel to it. The hotel seems to target Japanese business travelers and the tour bus set. The rooms were only so so. For the price, I expected much more. But then again the last time I was in Shanghai, I stayed at the Le Meridien so anything would probably pale in comparison to that, at least room wise. The decor was dated although everything was clean and functional. The bathroom did feature a typical Japanese toilet, with a variety of functions. Seat warmer, multiple spray options, etc. Whenever I turned the light on for the bathroom, the toilet made a &quot;start up sound&quot; so that took a bit of getting used to. The internet cost was 120 rmb. Sadly it didn't always work and was painfully slow when it did.The breakfast buffet was good and offered a large selection of items. The breakfast room was very busy.The hotel staff was very good. All of the employees wore a nametag that indicated the languages that they spoke.The hotel is located on a side street just off of Huai Hai Zhong Lu, which is one of the main shopping streets for Shanghai. A metra station is on the same block as the hotel. A Parkson's department store is also on the same block. The Parkson's has a nice grocery store in the basement and the ever popular McDonald's and Hagen Daz (sp?) at the front entrance of the store. A Starbucks can be found across the street from Parksons .If you have time, take a walk around the neighborhood as you will see a nice mix of old and new China. May 11 2017 	Love the renovated rooms especially the shower area	I have stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and did again recently when my usual choice in Shanghai is unavailable. I was booked into one of the renovated rooms and was pleasantly surprised. The renovated has a new furnishing and bathroom. The bathroom is excellent. Plenty of bright lights and very large shower area. The water pressure of the shower is real stress reliever after a long day. Being a Japanese hotel, a lot of attention has been paid to the bathroom, not forgetting the the toilet seat with warmer! The bed was on the hard side and the small pillow are not my favourite. While the rooms are very modern looking, I cannot help but noted the hotel lobby is in need of an update. Apr 20 2017 	Very pleased!	Stayed for five days in March and was very pleased. The hotel was undergoing renovation on three floors but did not impact us in any way. Our room was a bit dated but well appointed and comfortable. The bath was great and one of the best showers I have had in a hotel. Concierge staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast buffet should no be missed as there was delicious food for many different appetites. It was a great way to start the day. The location is great for touring and restaurants. The garden is beautiful and a serene spot in the busy city. I would definately recommend this hotel, however, I suspect the price will be higher when renovations are complete. Nov 29 2006 	Nice hotel	The Okura Garden Hotel in Shanghai was a very pleasant stay. Located in the French Concession area of Shanghai, it was only a quarter mile from Metro Line 1 and a major shopping area. The rooms were very nice, clean and well-appointed. The lobby, bars, and fitness facilities (3 treadmills, 2 bicycles, stairstepper, rower, freeweights, and benches) were excellent. For over $250/night U.S., it should be good! Majority of the guests were Japanese. Nov 24 2006 	Good hotel but not the Deluxe service advertised	The write-ups and reviews of the Okura Garden led me to believe I was in or something truly special. The reality fell short of this. As a westerner perhaps I am not this hotel’s main targeted demographic, (this is a Japanese chain aimed very much for that market), but my expectations were not met. First, let’s review what the hotel did well:- The staff are all polite and friendly and many are multi-lingual, - the views from the rooms are impressive, - the food in the three in-house restaurants is good and the rooms are kept clean. - the hotel is also conveniently close to a station on the excellent underground Metro system, which I used several times and found by far the cheapest and safest way to get around the city. (Taxis are plentiful but they drive like utter lunatics, and with seatbelts almost unknown here you risk much!)- There is the grass garden area out front – which is pretty unique in the city. The area is not vast and the proximity of traffic and the associated smog (in sunny weather especially) means this is not quite the oasis they describe, but it is still a nice feature. Now for the bad news:All the talk of 5-stars, best hotel in town, etc. both on this site and others made me expect the very best hotel experience, which this was not. For this money I expected an iron in the room, not a pressing service you have to pay extra for. The air conditioning was rather old and worn out, it taking most of the day to modify the room to be comfortable, as well as taking a day or so to clear the musty smell from the system. The promised internet access proved too mysterious for my laptop to handle, which was annoying for a business trip. My minibar contents had not been replaced in so long that not only were they all well past their use-by dates, but one glass bottle shattered in my hand when I just tried to lift it – a casualty of being in the very cold fridge for months if not years!The bed’s mattress was very firm and on one morning I found that my bedsheets had been replaced with a set that was very over-starched and that made my skin crawl. Not a good move.I also wish the staff would learn the difference between being attentive and being pestering. I didn’t need a maid to come in for a second time in the evening to “turn down” the bed and rearrange all my things gratuitously. Maybe this is a service others value and expect but it’s the first time I’ve encountered it and I found it intrusive and rather patronising. I don’t want to give the impression this is a bad hotel, because it is certainly a good one with service levels above many I have stayed in before. It just, in my view, does not justify the deluxe price tag -- especially when it has the competition in Shanghai from a wealth of other chains: Hilton, Four Seasons, Hyatt, etc., some of which I visited and was *very* impressed by. Jul 10 2006 	Quiet comfortable great service	I enjoyed my stay at the Okura Garden very much. The garden is large and welcoming -- an oasis of peace and tranquility in a noisy city. The food was excellent and quite diverse, though pricey in the upstairs European and Japanese restaurants. Not especially fashionable but the service and wonderful location more than make up for the slightly worn quality. Rooms not large but well equipped, clearly aimed at Japanese customers. Bathrooms lovely, with old marble and huge bathtubs. Easy walk to best open air market in Shanghai as well as many other sights - wonderful spot in middle of French concession. Mar 20 2005 	Close to marketplace and good value	This is hotel was presumably was built to welcome Japanese guests during Asia's go-go 80's. While it remains well cared for by the daily staff, the only way to reverse the aging of a hotel is to renovate. In the case of the Okura Garden, one can't help but notice the dated decor and tired carpets. Its older ambiance stands in contrast to the many newer addresses in the world's most dynamic city. All that said, the staff are superb, the facilities (including restaurants) entirely correct for the price. Rooms are clean. If you want Shanghai chic, stay at the Westin. If you want a good deal and good service, stay here.A major bonus with this hotel is its location near Shanghai's best outdoor marketplace. Louis Vuitton's worst nightmare, no doubt, but a really fun place to stock up on snobby brand knock-offs and nice silk items for friends back home. Nov 18 2021 	????????? Oct 27 2021 	??????????

"Oct 30 2018 	Loved the location	We were on a textile tour and our US guide had been to China 32 times. So she knew Shanghai. The hotel is being remodeled so get a room facing the street. I had two different rooms on two different occasions and had no problems. Everything was clean and the rooms were huge. I could walk right out of the hotel across the street to People's Park and never felt unsafe. The breakfast buffet was huge. I loved their fried potatoes....and the tomatoes were very fresh. I also ate some of the regional vegetables and meat. I did not drink the coffee as it was very strong. I loved the stay there. I can still hear the street saxaphone player outside the window......I also had some laundry done for a reasonable price. It came back the same day, folded very neatly and ironed better than I could. I would definitely go back. Feb 5 2018 	Lucky Dip	On my second stay at this hotel I discovered why it gets some OK reviews and some bad reviews. The room I was given this visit was meant to be the same class as the one I had a month before but there was no comparison. The room had bare floors where the carpert was ripped out. I got a tin of insect spray delivered to my room to deal with the cockroach and bed bugs, the shower was broken, the bed was small. After a night wrapped in my own clothes for protection as I slept and extensive 'negotiations' at front desk I got the room I had last time - '502' - they bumped another person who had booked it. Same price but much larger and included carpet and some light.At its best this place is passable. At it's worse it's an experience never to forget. The staff are generally helpful and the 502 cleaner was good but never expect a smile or them to be distracted from their own conversations for your benefit (even if you speak mandarin!) They never say 'xie xie' or 'bu ke qi'. The same company runs Park Hotel which looks much better and is very close - maybe the reject staff end up here. Jan 19 2018 	Disgusting and dirty do not stay here!	We checked into this hotel in the afternoon and checked out the next day. The hotel is disgusting and dirty. I can tolerate an older style hotel, but dirtiness? No way. It was a huge let down to our holiday. We checked into the lovely 5 star hotel next door. The bathroom was so appalling that I refused to get into the shower. It was mouldy, dingy and reminded of a cheap backpacker hostel. Jan 17 2018 	Convenient central location	This hotel, just north of People's Park, is in an ideal location for first-time tourists. It is next to the junction of two major subway lines, and just a few blocks from both the Nanjing Road pedestrian mall and the Shanghai Museum. The lobby has the appearance of a former elegance that has faded away. Our rooms were furnished with two twin beds, and large enough so we did not feel cramped for space but small enough that it did not feel luxurious. The furnishings were old, but in good condition. It was warm when we stayed there (about 30C), and the air conditioning was barely adequate. The rooms initially had a slightly musty odor, but that seemed to dissipate. The rooms have ethernet connections to the internet; when we did not find a cable, we bought one for 10RMB (later, we found an ethernet cable in the desk drawer). The buffet breakfast was pretty good, but it cost 66RMB; there were lots of places just outside the hotel where you could get a much cheaper breakfast. For those with an ATM card from Bank of America, there is a China Construction Bank ATM located in the shopping mall on Nanjing Road two doors to the east. Nov 15 2017 	Good location forget about luxury	Visited Shanghai for the first time with 2 girlfriends. Excellent location, room was clean, good shower but that's about it. No luxury whatsoever, which was fine with us as we were out all day and just needed a place to sleep. Definitely not the place for you if you like to spend a lazy day in. But will not stay here again, prefer a little more luxury next time. Nov 1 2017	What a DUMP! Avoid this place!!!	Just returned from a small group tour in China and had been suspicious of this hotel having read previous reviews on this website. (Sadly I had no choice since I was with a tour.) The only positive thing to be said about it is the location across from People's Square. The picture on their listing makes the hotel look glamorous with night lighting but don't let that fool you. The lobby looks elegant with it's vintage styling but that's as far as it goes. When we arrived I was given a dark, smoke scented and filthy room facing a dingy building. I immediately complained and was given a slightly &quot;better&quot; room on another floor, meaning that it didn't reek of smoke. I was too tired to move again but upon further inspection discovered old, decrepit scratched furniture with burn marks. Carpets were filthy and stained. Bathroom was grubby: moldy grout and caulking around tub and toilet. Window in bathroom was stained and not sealed. Furthermore there was no safe in either room I was in, although several members of our group had them, and had slighly cleaner brighter rooms than I did. (Most of the group was NOT happy with the accomodations.) Apparently there are a few remodeled rooms facing the street which, though noisy, at least had daylight. I stayed one night and woke up itching from some sort of bites on my head. There was no way I was going to stay in this place one more night, so I left and found a clean, modern and reasonably priced place elsewhere at my own expense. To add insult to injury, I later discovered that the front desk staff was completely useless at trying to locate guests. My husband attempted to call me several times and they said they couldn't find me on their roster. They had no record of my registration, and could not connect me to anyone in our group, in spite of the fact that they required our passports when we arrived. Forget it if there had been an emergency! I agree with the reviewer who mentioned not staying in older hotels in China. We stayed in a few other older hotels in China but they were cleaner and better kept. All the resources seem to be going into new properties in preparation for the 2018 Olympics. Oct 30 2017 	Great base to explore Shanghai	This hotel is nothing special - but then you're not paying top dollar for a room here. Hotel is well located just over the road from People's Square metro station (which is conveniently linked to Pudong International by a single simple change for the Maglev train at Longyang Road).The rooms were nothing special, but were well turned out and comfortable.The front desk were nothing special either, but were more than capable of translating addresses from English into Chinese for use with taxis.The hotel is not a place to spend oodles of time in. It is more suited as a place simply to sleep at. As such, I highly recommend it as a base for exploring based on its location and price. Jul 27 2017 	Not worth it	We stayed here for 4 nights in July. The good things first: breakfast was included in our hotel price and it was a decent spread of western and chinese food. The AC (a necessity in the hot summer months in China) worked well in our room. Location was great, across from the Metro and People's Square and right down the street from the flashy pedestrian shopping area and upscale mall. The minuses...I got a creepy feeling everytime I walked in due to the fact that the employees were always staring at us. I saw other westerners staying at this hotel and even after a couple of days after thet got to recognize that we were staying in the hotel, they still stared at us. The rooms are definitely old (marketed as old world European) but there's a difference between old and dirty, this place was both! The carpets were stained in the rooms and there were cracks on the walls and near the sink and shower. The last night we were there there was a constant drip near the mini bar, probably caused by the room above's AC. Given our limited knowledge of Chinese and the employees minimal knowledge of English, it was difficult to tell them that they needed to fix the problem. Overall, there must be a better deal in Shanghai than this place. The overall ambience was not worth spending the money on. May 27 2017 	Great Location	This hotel is wonderfully located in front of People Square (main museums, metro station), next to the main shopping street and if you like walking, you can do it all the way to the river or the french quater. My room was perfect and quiet. Interenet at the business center was ok.In the restaurant they are not very friendly. You can have your breakfast in the Stabucks only a block away.rates were good value for money and the staff at the front desk was helpful.I would easily go back th this hotel Nov 26 2006 	Don't bother possibly the worst hotel in China!	I've stayed in this hotel during my vacation my first time in Shanghai, China last year and it basically ruined my trip. I just had a conversation with a friend last week and she told she just had an exciting and wonderful time in Shanghai the week before and she told me she also stayed at a 2-3 star hotel but a new one! She told me to NEVER stay in a hotel that is not new because the maintence of hotels in China is not the best.... I've then decided that I need to give some guidance to fellow travellers before booking a hotel in Shanghai because it could basically make or break your stay in this city...also NO ONE should experience the horrible nightmare that we were in.I was travelling with my husband's family since they have some family friends in this city and we have decided to stay for a few nights. My sister-in-law booked this hotel thinking I would absolutely adore it since it's supposed to be built early in the century with Renaissance-esque decoration since I do adore anything that has some sort of antiquity to it. When we arrived, we were quite impressive with stone Roman Columns at the front entrance but it ends there...When we walked into the front entrance, the hotel looked like it was not maintained since it was built and the front desk was EXTREMELY slow, it took at least half an hour to check in and there is NO service for anything since we wanted to know if there is any local day tour or local attraction, their reply was always no or don't know....Our room size was decent but I felt like I was back in my dorm room in college with minimal amenities but the feeling is A LOT worst, at least my dorm room was clean. The windows open to a VERY DUSTY wall and we just keep the curtain close at ALL times. Also, the room is not well kept and the carpet looked filthy so we had to walk around in socks the whole time we were there (we threw our socks away at the end of the trip). The bathroom is okay but the crevices between the tiles in the bathtub is black. TV remote control had dirt all around the numbers and we had to use a towel to use it.... Believe me - I DID NOT put any of my clothes away and left them in the luggage at ALL times. I was joking to my husband that I need to go to a local supermarket to get some cleaning supplies and scrub this place clean!Actually, one incident that I will never forget comes when my husband realized he left his wallet behind after about 2 blocks away and we had to go back up to get it and guess what, they had already finished cleaning the room...we were amazed and not surprised given the above condition. Basically - we dreaded going back to the hotel every night and I cannot complain because my in-laws have already felt really bad... I've never felt happier checking out of ANY hotel. I've stayed at MANY hotels since I travelled a lot for business (have stayed from 6 stars to 1 star hotel) but this is one of the worst hotel I've stayed in. Sep 28 2006 	What a Great Place to Stay!!!	I will certainly stay here next time I go to Shanghai! The location is absolutely awesome, right at the intersection of East and West Nanjing Roads. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and, while their English is not what you could call &quot;bilingual,&quot; they do their best to be completely responsive to your needs. The hotel itself has all the amenities in a lovely old Italianate style hotel. If they put in new carpeting they could easily upgrade to a 4 star! It was wonderful to have a free internet laptop in my room. I stayed there for 4 days and never used the restaurant because there was too much available outside the hotel in easy walking distance. Everything in my room was clean and in perfect condition. Don't be afraid of the bad review of this hotel. It is above average for the price and you could never beat the location. Dec 12 2005 	Great location and room with a view	My family spent five days at the hotel and found location to be excellent. We paid for a better room facing the front and it was worth the extra. Everything in the room was great including the internet connection to my notebook. my friend had a single room in the back which was quieter than the front but looks into a dirty courtyard with debris. The restaurant standards are average but there is a famous eating street two minutes walk away.This hotel is excellent for location and facet for a reasonable price. It is an old building with slightly worn carpets and decor so don't expect the same shine as the Radisson hotel next door. I will use this hotel again for the location and ambience of people's square. Note that this hotel is inconvenient for handicap or wheelchair. Nov 8 2005 	Not Even a 3 Star	I was unfortunate enough to stay here because my travel agent could not book me in any where else. This hotel was built in 1928 and at that time it would have been outstanding - but it is no longer. This hotel is in desperate need of a serious make over as everything is tired and worn out. I stayed in two different rooms, a suite and a twin share. In the suite I turned over the bed spread and it had stains that looked to me as though they could be bodily fluids. The beds are hard but that is the case right throughout China. The showers water pressure resembled a hose and that was in both rooms. The rooms are clean overall but the grout in one of the bathrooms was really dirty. The breakfast buffet caters more to eastern tastes but there is a western menu available which consists of coffee, toast and ceral. I stayed away from the milk but I am always sceptical of dairy products in Asia. Coffee and tea facilities in room is Chinese Tea. Cable T.V is HBO and BBC world news and about 50 other Chinese stations. The best things about this hotel is the location but if you want to eat western food go next door to the Radisson.

"Oct 14 2021 	Lovely hotel and great value	This is a very nice looking new trendy hotel. The service is OK. The rooms are roomy and clean. If you have business in the area this is a great value hotel.The pool is long and narrow - the best I have seen for a Hotel to do laps. Feb 8 2021 	One of the best business hotels in Shanghai	I travel to Shanghai moderately often on business. The Parkyard is ideally suited to people doing business in the Zhangjiang industrial park (Lenovo, Flextronics, Valeo, and many other international high tech firms). It is a bit off the &quot;beaten path&quot; if you are headed out at night for dinner with clients and colleagues, but the organic restaurant in the train station next door has excellent food and is fine for casual dining (and I'm really picky about Asian cuisine).The hotel is almost new, with a solid 4-5 star level of furnishings and decorations. The layout tends to a cross between German modern and contemporary Chinese serene. Unlike some other expensive Shanghai hotels, staff is generally well trained (except the shoe shine service, which was horrible ... the put lots of polish on the shoes, but then didn't buff it off!). The heath club really is a health club with a nice lap pool, exercise room and quality &quot;real&quot; massage service. Breakfast is very good, if sometimes crowded. The house coffee is not good, use the automatic capuccino machine instead.The only caveats; there are a block of rooms along one side of the hotel that are situated along a very noisy/busy sidewalk (I think it's ChenHui Road). There's a 8' privacy wall, but it doesn't help if you want to sleep in. Always request a room with a window to one of the interior courtyards.Price: I think it's one of the best values in Shanghai, even when you factor in the cost of a taxi to PuDong or PuXi. Nov 3 2018 	Quite nice just some small little problems...	I stayed in this hotel 3 times since Oct 2017. As the previous poster pointed out, it's a new hotel and is very close the Zhangjiang industrial park where some international companies are located. I stayed there for the same reason.It's also very near to the subway station, about 5 mins' walk, to the right of the hotel.As far as the hotel is concerned, the bell hops are all very polite, helpful and cheerful. Two of them remembered me and when I last stayed - that was quite impressive!!The hotel is a business hotel with only one restaurant which serves breakfast and dinner with a limited menu. The breakfast is good with a great variety. Now dinner is average and pricey so just step out of the hotel and walk to the food and entertainment area next to the hotel (literally next door - subway, starbucks, Chinese restaurants, etc)I like the fact that the lobby is chic, minimalistictic and smells good all the time. The rooms are spacious with the same minimalist style. Internet is free of charge and works very well.The only problem with this hotel is HOUSEKEEPING - for my 1st and 3rd (most recent) stay, I needed to call the housekeeping back to do the clean up again. There was hair, watery stain and patches of sticky stuff on the writing desk this time.The manager was very apologetic and explained that it was because they were running full house, which could be true. I was eventually upgraded to an executive suite because there was no other room available that night. In that room though, the phone didn't work.These small little issues prevent me from giving this hotel a rating of 5. I do look forward to staying at this hotel again because the staff is friendly (except for the staff at breakfast).By the way, if you are coming back to the hotel from Puxi area, make sure that you bring the hotel's address. Most drivers on the other side of the city doesn't know this hotel. Tell them it's next to the subway station. I will post pics later...hope this helps! Dec 30 2017 	Great place to stay for ZhangJiang	I booked several nights for a business delegation to Pudong, and this was an ideal hotel for our needs. There was great attention to our every request, and the staff were beyond helpful. The hotel is new, and since it is at the last Subway stop in Pudong, relatively quiet (i.e., no tourists) - which was, again, perfect for our group. As it was located right next door to the Zhangjiang station, our commute to Puxi and other locations was simple and efficient. Jul 23 2021 	Hotel Parkyard Shanghai. Apr 17 2021 	Non credo lo consiglierei..."
"Nov 2 2021 	Great Location Cheap hotel Werid smell	This is really a weird hotel, sure some parts of it needs renovation.Good things: It has a great location, subway (People Sq) is 1 min walk from hotel, 10 min walk from a large shopping area, size of single rooms are good, cheap price compared to its ratings, helpful stuff.Bad things: very smelly reception and base floor, average room cleanness (good compared to China standard), very very noisy areaOverall I recommend it. Oct 22 2021 	Nice but half old!	Hard to tell about my feelings about this hotel. Good location but quite noisy. Very nice room...so you might wonder what is wrong ? something in the mood of that hotel - new build on old...sometimes it gives very good results but in that particular case, it gives a starnge feeling. My phone was not working, I tried to explain the problem at the reception but gave up after some minuts. For the price I got on internet and considering it is in Shanghai, maybe ok but next time, I will try an other hotel. Breakfast cost about 100 RMB. If you have a rate without breakfast and eat breakfast there, staff gets very nervous...3 persons asks me 'what is your room no ?' within 5 minutes. Jul 30 2021 	Hotel with history- great location and good value	Even though it's no longer the tallest building in Shanghai and you wouldn't spot it immediately (all dark on outside, not shiny and all glass), this hotel offers tourists a perfect location right at Ren Min Park, only minutes on foot from Nanjing West Road where all the shopping malls are located. Rooms are clean (except for one cockroach in bathroom, having lived there for hundreds of generations since 1934, I guess) and service is ok. Try to book online as prices vary a lot! Jun 3 2021 	Stay clear of this one	Well, it is noisy.The service at the front desk was a little too stand off / I don't care.The door man couldn't be bothered to help with luggage to the room.The room appeared nice at first. But after looking closer, there was femail hair on the bathroom floor. The tub was scratched. The towels were frayed around the edges and when I pulled one off the towel rack, there was a little tiny bug on it....could it be a tick? Now I am itching myself every five minutes!! I am staying here right now as I type this and doors are slamming and you can hear people in the room next to me.The location is great, but compared to what I have stayed at in China, this one is pretty high priced for what you get in return (but it's also the lowest one on I found on this strip). Jul 23 2018 	Local Insights	Hmmm! A dated old hotel that needs to learn about customer service. I was checked into a 'Corner' room on the 18th floor which was clean and had a great view and an updated bathroom and shower. However, there was no hot water. When I complained I was told they were fully booked but would change me the next day and yes, they knew that the 18th floor had no hot water... but hadn't bothered to mention it . Moved to a non-smoking room on a lower floor that had cigarette burns in the carpet and wasn't overly clean but at least was large!The buffet breakfast was terrible, no choice or quality. Staff had very limited English and communication was hard going. The location wasn't bad and it was less expensive than the nearby Sheraton. Apr 27 2018 	NOT Recommended: Smelly old hotel but well known hotel for locals	I selected this hotel in the internet after considering its great location and reasonable prices. I stayed there for 4 nights in 2017. The lobby was smelly with smoke. Old decoration. Limited services. Apr 2 2018	Quaint and historic but substandard	I was booked by a business associate and had no say over the choice of hotel. If I come back I'd definitely stay somewhere else, although the Park is a fascinating piece of Shanghai history and has been renovated up to Western standards, more or less. When I checked in I was advised I had been upgraded to a suite, only to find myself in a large rather spartan room overlooking a three-story video monitor right outside my window! It flooded the room with blinding light at 7 p.m. The blackout curtains helped, and the video is turned off around 11 p.m.Then there was no hot water the following morning, and the following today I woke up to absolutely no electricity. The hotel fixed it, but suffice it to say if it's consistent quality you want, this ain't the place. But it has character that the new steel-and-glass hotels don't have. Mar 31 2018 	Historical hotel in need of a renovation	I just came back from a visit in Shanghai and we stayed in the Park Hotel near Nanjing Square. The Park hotel has some historical significance (it was the tallest building in Shanghai for some time) and its location is great because of it's proximity to Nanjing Square which is a pedestrian only shopping area with lots of food and retail shops around. Also, the subway is just across the street from the hotel.The downside is the room. The size of our room on the 5th floor was large, however, it reeked of smoke and you could tell that the carpet has seen much better days. definitely use slippers when walking around the room. Grouting and tile in the bathroom could also use some updating as well. Also, the television had plenty of english channels which was nice.The hotel lobby looked great, but don't be fooled. As other reviewers have noted, this self proclaimed 4 star establishment is much closer to a 3 star. The gym is outdated and the business center was extremely expensive to use the computer and make a few printouts. Great location, sub par rooms, and not the best amenities. I would recommend staying elsewhere for your money. Dec 22 2017 	AVOID...!	Having read the other reviews i can't fault the location, it was nice to be right in the center of the city but the hotel somehow of the other didn't quite appeal to me...I chose it because having stayed in china for over 3 weeks in diff hotels thought i might as well look for a more reasonable option but i still regret it til date!The Lobby seemed ok in the evening when i had come in to check in, but after i paid my deposit and went up to my room i was hugely dissapointed by the size of the room but still didn't mine, it was also extremely noisy but that was ok, but there was a problem in the airconditioning system and it was extremely noisy and also some leakages in the bathroom. I complained to the reception a few times, they finally sent someone up to see the problem but still didn;t do anything so finally hours later i went downstairs to the reception and complained again, having had to argue with the guy for over half an hour i asked for my deposit back so i would go to another hotel nearby but he refused to help me but instead offered me a business room for a high rate, which he finally accepted togive at the same rate. This hotel was definitely much better but was on a corner of the building so was shaped very strangely , either way i didn't really care as i was only there for 1 night, the bathroom was clean and spacious so i thought it was better just to manage, also it had a computer there and internet connection at no extra cost.In the night i went out and realised that the entire hotel entrance is filled with homeless people and people offering karwoke and massages and what not. Even leabing the hotel was harrasment as little kids would grab onto my legs demanding money, this was much worse when i cam eback in at the end of the night, realy not worth saving that extra money to go throuhg all that..The next morning i had called up requesting for a later check out which the receptionish agreed till 2 so at quarter to 2 i asked for someone to come up an dhelp me with my luggage but was kept waitiunf for 45 minutes untill i finally came down muself with the luggage, waitinf ro the life alone took me another 5minutes, finally when checking out the lady said i was too late to check out as checkout time is 11 so they are going to charge me half a days rate for late check out, I told her about the lady from the reception allowing me until 2, which they refused to believe, it got a point where they called out the owner and they said they was no recordof anyone speaking to me, finally after arguing for another 20mins they agreed to waive this extyra charge but still didn't believe me claiming that they never allow check out later then 11!Overall a very strange and dissappointing experience, i think a lesson has been learnt here not to go for cheap hotels in China, I had even asked owner why he allowed all guests to be harassed by people when leaving and ebntering hte hotel at night but he just laughed, not sure iof he understood what i was sayingt to him even! Oct 20 2017 	Great value option	I would absolutely return.The hotel is actually a small piece of history as it is one of the oldest in Shangai. All in all it is well kept and a nice find! Great service and a comfortable setting.The Hotel is just off the famous Nanjing shopping district and within walking distance (for those who don't mind a bit of a walk) of &quot;The Bund&quot; district. The only complaints were the small, HARD (not firm), HARD beds, but I've found that to be somewhat common in China. The rooms are typically small (like those in most European Hotels), but comfortable. Great tip - this hotel is about 100m from the Raddisson Hotel. The Raddisson has a large rotating restaurant on the 45th floor (think space needle or CN tower). Unbelievable view and good food. Enjoy lunch or dinner. Doesn't open until 11:30 am. Oct 7 2017	An Old Standard	The Park must have had a renovation since some of the earlier reviews posted here. We found it clean and up-to-date, and looking younger than its long history might suggest. Its location is as good as it gets and it appears that all the new competition is keeping the Park’s rates modest. There are many new choices around that are more exciting, but don’t rule out the park because you are afraid it is old and run down. Sep 19 2017 	Try Central Hotel	Pro: its locationCon: noisy, old, smelly, service all below averagei recommend Central Hotel located at Jiu Jiang Rd near Nanjing Rd, it's a newer and cleaner and better service hotel Jun 22 2017 	Two rooms - one hotel	The first room I received was on the 3rd floor which is non-smoking. It was a very large corner suite. The windows are single pane and it sounded like the traffic outside was coming through my room. The bed was the worst of the three hotels in China I stayed at. I spoke to the front desk eand was moved to the 12th floor. The upper floors are business rooms and my room had a computer. The room had been remodeled and I could barely hear the traffic noise. Once I changed rooms I really began to enjoy my stay. The breakfast buffet was ok, but no ther amenities - this is an old hotel. Lots of foreign tourists were there. May 28 2017 	Good Location but can be noisy	We chose this hotel because we wanted to stay in the centre of Shanghai . The setting was ideal, right on the edge of Peoples Square and we enjoyed walking round it (and underneath where there is an enormous shopping precinct aimed mainly at teenagers).The hotel was a superb art deco period piece and apparently had been Mao's favourite hotel in Shanghai.We were given an upgrade -a massive suite of rooms,however there was a lot of noise (traffic and people shouting right through the night from the adjoining street at the back of the hotel). The bed and bathrooms were of a high qualityThe breakfasts were OK but not as good or varied as at some of the other places we stayed at May 20 2017 	oldcodgers	Arrived at hotel tired after a long flight only to find that they did not have our booking. WE BOOKED THIS LAST NOVEMBER. After 40 minutes the girl on the desk decided to give us a room for the night but informed us that we would have to take it up with the booking agent in the morning. We told her in no uncertain terms that this was not acceptable and insisted on speaking to the Manager who appeared after the 4th time of insisting. He apologised using the excuse that the girl was new to her job and immediately upgraded us to a suite to compensate for our upset. This hotel must certainly have been grand in its heyday but now is a very tired old lady in great need of a makeover. The staff in front were very polite and eager to help with tours and taxis etc but the staff in the restaurant certainly needed training. All they seemed to be interested in was pushing plates around and only responded when we tried to serve ourselves with tea and coffee. Plates of food were not recharged on the buffet and each day we had to ask for items. NOT GOOD. Cleanliness was average overall. Certainly would not grade this as a 4 star. The good thing was the locality of the hotel - covenient. Was fun watching the excercisers in Peoples Square right oposite our room. Apr 15 2017 	Great Value	The hotel may be old, but the service and the room facilities are certainly up to a 4 star hotel standard. We arrived at the hotel and were immediately upgraded to an excutive room (without any reason or charge). Our room overlooked the People Park from th 14th floor, which was a great treat. The room was in pretty good shape with a PC and wireless free of charge (for this level of rooms). Breakfast is not very impressive, but there is really not much choice if you wish to eat out in the vicinity. The hotel is right in front of the 2 major subway lines which is great to travel around the city if you are keen to use it. Access to cab is also very convenient being located on a major intersection. 10 minutes walk to Nanjing East Road (the famous pedestrian walk). The staff were generally friendly, especially when you are polite to them. Mar 6 2017	Tired Hotel but Central Location	The Park Hotel on Nanjing Road is a block away from the Nanjing Road Pedestrian Walking street. The hotel’s glory days are in the past. The exterior of the hotel is showing its age. When entering from the pedestrian walking street the most noticeable signage to the hotel is the Bank of China sign. The bank takes up the east side of the ground floor of the hotel so the hotel entrance is obscured. Also the hotel entrance is at a multi-road intersection so taxis cannot queue for a spot. The taxi queue is actually a half a block away to the east in front of the Radisson New World Hotel. Inside the lobby is rather dark, unappealing, and smelly of both an old hotel and of smoke. The lobby is rather dated and worm and needs a major remodel. Some English is understood by the hotel staff. The elevator is quick but small. The room was very spacious with all the amenities including a kettle, minibar, free water bottles, TV, blowdryer, and safe. A major disappointment was the carpet of the room was worn and wrinkled. It seems the carpet was at least 15 years old maybe 20 years old and should be immediately replaced. The bathroom was a total disappointment. The tiles on the bathroom were old. The grout caulking was graying/blacking and unappealing. The ceiling of the bathroom showed evidence of the water leak and was poorly patched; very unappealing. The hot water took at least 10 minutes to warm up. The free water bottles were necessary because the Shanghai water smelled of remnants of sewage with a very unappealing odor and taste. Do not drink the tap water unless thoroughly boiled and then that should be avoided if possible. The air quality in the room was poor. Though it was a non-smoking room it was not a non-smoking floor so the smokers from the other rooms made the room smell bad.The hotel bills itself as four stars. Overall at about $US130 (final price all tax in) a night at peak season the Park Hotel can be considered a poor choice for a four star hotel and is not recommended at this price if you want a 4 star hotel. You should pay more and get the quality that is desired for a 4 star hotel. The Park Hotel grade is “3 star” out of 5 stars. If you want to pay at this price point and get an acceptable but run-down hotel then this place is okay.Pros: Good shopping location, close to transit Metro station, helpful front desk staffCons: Outside lobby entrance is small and not noticeable, close to busy and noisy traffic intersection, no full non-smoking floors, air quality in lobby is musty and smoky, air quality in non-smoking room is musty and some smoke coming over from the smoker rooms. Nov 16 2006 	Very good hotel great location	Spent two nights in this hotel in October 2006. Room could do with some renovation, but was very comfortable and spacious with everything you needed - TV, radio, air con, broadband (not wireless), mini-bar, coffee machine. Air con was perhaps slightly noisy. Also worth asking for a room with a view to Remnibi square, mine had average view at the back. Staff was very helpful, front desk spoke perfect English. Did not try the restaurant or any of the other facilities so can't comment on them. Location is excellent, right on Remnibi square for access to the sites there, metro station and very easy to get taxis or even the bus if feeling adventurous. Would definitively stay there again if I find it at the same price. Highly recommended. Sep 24 2006 	Great deal for the single traveler	For many years, the Park Hotel was the tallest building in Shanghai and probably in China. It is located right at People's Square, close to the city's best museums, and right at the intersection of the two subway lines for easy transportation. The breakfast buffet is also very good. A small business center and travel agency provide important services. This 1930s hotel has lots of charm and--most importantly--a terrific price on the hotel's website for a single room. (Larger rooms are much more pricey.) All in all, well worth serious consideration. Jul 6 2006	Art Deco Classic	My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Park Hotel in late May, 2006. If you like hotels with character, this is a good choice. The Park Hotel is well located on Nanjing Road, across the street from a subway stop, and near shops and restaurants. The lobby and the restaurant areas are art nouveau gems from the turn of the century. The wood paneling and light fixtures in the restaurant are particularly stunning. Our room was on the ninth floor. It was small and somewhat cramped, but attractively furnished and very comfortable. There was a built-in closet, dresser with t.v., small table and reading chair. This particular room even came with a computer and high-speed internet access. The tiled bathroom was small but adequate, with a tub-shower combination. There was very little counter space. The breakfast buffet was extensive and very good. We had dinner at the hotel one night and although it was ok, there are probably better choices nearby. Jun 7 2006	Park Hotel has it all	Just returned from Shanghai and the Park Hotel. Hotel has everything -- great location-across from very usable subway (signs and announcements in English) ,beautifully landscaped People's Park, Nanjing Rd.(main shopping street), and Shanghai Art Museum. Hotel very clean. Beautifully restored Art Deco public areas. Get deal with buffet breakfast included-served in beautiful Deco main dining room. Staff English skills from poor to good depending on who you speak to. Our room had double-paned windows and no noise. Bed and bedding very comfortable. Right in back of hotel are local Chinese restaurants with English menus. Nearby are lanes with fascinating traditional life going on. Would definitely recommend this hotel for comfort, price, and location. May 1 2006	Good location but noisey	Stayed here at the end of april for 4 nights. This hotel is ideally located for the Nanjing Road shops, underground/subway &amp; walking to the Bund.The hotel still has the charms of the 1930s when it was built but unfortunately does not have double glazing so it sounds like you are sleeping on the street. The Chinese drivers like to use their horns every 10 seconds ! Make sure you get a room on the highest floor possible. Beds are typical Chinese style - very hard, but this seems to be the thing at all hotels.Breakfast room is amazing and the food is good also. Feb 10 2006	Good value for money	The location couldn't be better. It's near the main shopping pedestrian mall and just opposite the subway. Free internet access on desktop machines in the room was a big hit with my teenage children. Lots of good eateries nearby. No major grouses. For what we paid, it was very good value. Jan 20 2006	Not bad	Location: Outstanding. Near the subway, Ningjing shopping street, local eateries and shops, a short walk to starbucks and a very great bar called Barberossa or so behind starbucks.Room:A bit dated. Had problem with air con - it blew out too much heat that we couldn't breathe. Called room service/ operator for help but they didn't show up. We finally had to sleep with windows open. Service:We slept three in the room. But they provided only two sets of amenities till i made a request. Overall, staff are very nice and helpful. Nov 25 2005	Park Hotel - Convenient Location	I am writing from my hotel room via the free internet service. The hotel is centrally located, opposite the People's Square metro station. There are many inexpensive restaurants/cafes and lots of major departmental stores within the vicinity. I enjoyed my stay in the hotel. The only slight 'complaints' that I might have of the hotel are the lights are very dim and on the first day the room had a very strong smell of cigarettes (although I was given a non-smoking room) and the toiletries are not exactly the best, given the price of the hotel. In addition, non-smoking rooms are located on the lower levels and in the mornings, it's quite noisy.In general, if you are looking for a hotel that is strategically located and within a medium price range, this would be one of them. Oct 27 2005	Customer service left a lot to be desired	I was disappointed with the level of service I received at this hotel. The hotel offers money changing facilities for guests yet front desk staff refused to change currency saying that the notes were old tender (they were not). Coffee and tea making facilities were provided in the room but we were charged for the 4 sachets of sugar we requested as none was provided in the room. Staff refused to remove the charge from my bill even though we were paying over £70 a night for the room. This is not the kind of service I would expect from a 4 star hotel and was a disappointing end to a good holiday in China. Oct 18 2005	Great Hotel!	This hotel is located right at the top of the shopping area on Nanjing Street and is probably about a 30 mins walk from The Bund (the end of the Nanjing shopping area). The Shanghai theatre is about 5 mins walk and the area is very lively but not noisy. The rooms are comfortable, clean and well decorated and the concierge is amazing. They were able to help us plan our weekend there and saved us quite a bit of money by arranging taxis for us instead of taking tours which are often costly and not necessarily informative in China (beware of hotel tours, a number of them will take you to commercial stops such as silk and jade factories and Chinese Medicine clinics to pressure you to spend money). All the staff were wonderful and a shuttle bus is available from the airport to drop you within walking distance of the hotel. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Shanghai given its ideal location and good service. Sep 8 2005	Great location and wonderful park view	I am writing this review from my room in the Park Hotel: there is a computer and free internet connection. My week-long stay here has been very enjoyable. It is a great location--the Union Square of Shanghai (with the Met [Shanghai Grand Theatre] thrown in). The Remin Square Metro station is across the road (it's a central hub for the two main lines). I asked for a room looking out over Remin Square--and even from the third floor it is a fantastic view. It's a big room, with double windows, looking over the park and city lights at night. Ask for room #303! It has cost me around RMB950 (+15 % tax) per night: the same as if I had a room at the back of the hotel. It's a bit more than I had intended to pay; but it has been worth it. The hotel, unfortunately, has little art deco left: the rooms are aesthetically ordinary, but comfortable (the beds are real hard, but I have liked that). I also considered the Yangtze Hotel: but as of Sep 2005 there is still a lot of construction work going on there. It could be some time before that dies down. I also thought about the Ruijin Guesthouse, in the French Concession; its more money, but lovely if you want a bit of piece and quiet. While the Park is a great central location for sight-seeing, there aren't a lot of great restaurants within easy walking distance (wonderful exception: Kathleen's 5, across the way); there are good local joints, but you'll likely need chinese to negotiate that. If you aren't going to stay at one of the top-end-of-town hotels, this is a really good option to consider. Mar 19 2005	Grand old dame in the heart of Shanghai	The Park Hotel located on Nanjing West Road in downtown Shanghai is one of the grand old hotels of a byegone era - an era when Shanghai used to be separted into the French and British concessions. Built in classical European style, the lobby exudes a stylish elegance reminiscent of the 1930s when the hotel was the zero center point of Shanghai. The elegant dining room is spacious with a commanding view of the city. The rooms are huge and clean. At around US$90 for a double room, it is excellent value for money as it is located just directly across People's Square, the transportation hub of Shanghai and 10 minutes walk to Nanjing East pedestrian mall, leading to the famous Bund. Behind the hotel, there are numerous small eateries where the locals patronise - you should be able to read Chinese if you decide to patronise any of these eateries as there is no English menu. Nov 14 2021	Hotel war sehr gut aber nachts laute Baustellengeräusche. Rezeptionspersonal zu gestresst. Oct 24 2021 	????????? Sep 22 2021 	Tres bon hotel depuis qu'il a été refait !! Oct 2 2018 	???????????????"
"Just not quite there yet...	Date of Stay: November 27-29,2021Room Type: Deluxe River Vie RoomUpgrade: noneAmount Paid Per Night: 3,800RMB (560USD) plus taxesReservation Method: Peninsula WebsiteLoyalty Card: NoneAirport/Hotel Transfer: Came with the hotel package but they picked me up at the Park Hyatt instead of the airport since I was just moving between hotels. The driver doesn't speak english at all, but I'm not all that chatty anyway. Location: It's directly on the &quot;main&quot; Bund area (which is under a lot of road work these days for the World Expo in 2020) just two blocks from Nanjing Road. Taxi's don't know where the hell it is but I suppose its because it's new. Check-in: check in counter was filled with staff but they can't seem to get it right, it took them 15 minutes to get my key to work but after 15 minutes they decided to just take me up first to the room and just send up the key later. (it finally took them 2 hours to do that because of some malfunction on the system)Room: The room was weird. it was big enough to be a Junior suite or at least a Grand Deluxe room. When you enter the door you have an anteroom, ahead is the door to the bedroom and to your left is the walk in closet. The problem was the window in the bedroom was on the corner and not as big as those on the photos, it was like just 1 meter wide, so you can see part of the Pudong Skyline (with the correct angle you can see the Pearl TV tower) and on the other side you can see another river. I'm not really particular about the view but the problem was the roof of the tent they placed in front of the window which obstructed the view even more. Like I said i'm really not particular about it but when you pay so much for a river view, you expect at least a descent one. I called the operator they said the front desk is busy but will call as soon as they can, i waited for an hour, literally finished watching the latest episode on Glee on the TV from my iPod.They eventually called after I called the operator again to follow up, at first they told me there is nothing they could do about it but they could move me to a suite the following day. When I told them that since I'm only in for 2 night and having just transferred after my first night at Park Hyatt I don't want to go through the inconvenience of moving to another room again. They finally showed another room a smaller one this time but it has the same problem because half the view was blocked by the hotel building. In fact from the bed, you can only see the other side of the huangpu river, the Pudong skyline could only be seen from the side where the work desk and TV are. So left between a bigger room with half a small obstructed view or a small room with the wrong view, we settled for the bigger room.Bathroom: is big, instead of the relief shown on the bathroom photos, they have a window. The shower stall was adequate, not really small but not as big as the one at Park Hyatt either. The toilet is pretty standard, I expected it to be automated like the ones at Peninsula Tokyo or Park Hyatt Beijing &amp; Shanghai, so I was quite disappointed when I said it wasn't .Bed: Bed was very comfortable not really too soft and not hard either, but the pillows were too soft, I use down feather pillows at home and they aren't that soft...your head literally sinks on it.. Breakfast: breakfast was chaotic, it felt more like a Chinese restaurant at lunch hour than a hotel lobby and it wasn't even because of the hotel guests. You'd expect that after a month the staff would be a bit better in what they were doing than that and the american breakfast was served cold. Check-out: Check out okay but when I was going up to my room from breakfast I told the guy at the front desk that I am running a bit late for my flight and could they print my stuff so we could make it faster. But when I got down I was surprised they didn’t do anything given that the front desk didn’t have much guests so they weren’t even too busy to accede to my request.Overall Evaluation: The Peninsula never made it feel like that I was special or welcome. Okay, the &quot;Good Morning&quot;. &quot;Zhao shang hao&quot;, &quot;nin hao&quot;, is perfunctory so it doesn't really count. They won't even greet you when you pass the front desk, they would be busy minding their own stuff talking to other staff. I really have to say it wasn't very welcoming. They also have to work on their English, I have been to China so many times that I'm pretty much used to the level of English they use, but even for a new hotel (having stayed at the Le Royal Meridien and Hyatt on the Bund just months after they opened) I have to say the Peninsula staff just doesn't cut it. Would I stay there again? I doubt I would ever come back, on my next trip I might just stay at the Park Hyatt instead since they did offer a room upgrade on my next visit or the Fairmont might be open by then. Nov 21 2021 	During the Soft Opening	Inspite of many of the hotel's services not being fully operational, it is clear that this will be an excellent place to stay when all is completed. The rooms are spectacular. Nov 18 2021 	Beautiful throughout but some work to be done on the service	The Peninsula has probably the most beautiful hotel room I have ever stayed in - a perfect combination of ancient and modern Chinese, with a slice of art deco(check out the photos). Every detail is exquisite and the idea of the dressing roomoutside the bathroom is so superb I wonder why nobody has ever thought of it before.And the details are carried through into the public areas too which aregorgeous too. The bed was also the most comfortable I have ever slept in anywhere. And the internet radio worked well, as did the internet phone which allows free international calls. The service from the front of house staff was generally excellent as was the pick-upfrom the airport. But the service in the restaurants definitely needs some work. Wewent to the Cantonese restaurant one evening and the poor service let the place down- wine brought late and seemingly fresh from a microwave rather than a fridge, winerefills unforthcoming, general inattentiveness from the staff. Even worse wasbreakfast where service was pretty shoddy for a top-class hotel with wrong ordersbeing delivered, refills of tea/coffee missing, and tables generally being ignored.Worst of all was one morning when my plate was delivered with some unwanted baconwhich I had specifically said was not needed. When I said it was the wrong order thewaitress offered to remove the bacon from the plate and kindly explained that thefood had been cooked separately. Only when I explained why I wanted a new plate didshe bring one. Laughably inept.It's great that the hotel is training new staff but I'd leave it a while until thestaff are up to speed. By contrast, the other hotel we stayed in Shanghai (the Puli, seeseparate review) was impeccable. I'd give that one a go while the Peninsula gets up to speed. Nov 10 2021	Luxury	After an absence of a decade, I finally returned to Shanghai, and was stunned to find a city that I barely recognized; luxury and style could be found all around.I arrived in Pudong's new terminal 2 - world class. Hoped on the Maglev Train, and has a great ride! A shame it doesn't take you all the way into town - badly thought out - but still a fun experience. Stayed at the newly opened Peninsula Hotel. Though I still prefer their Hong Kong property, their rooms were beautiful and well appointed! Was blown away by the afternoon tea in the Park Hyatt out in Pudong. Had several exceptional dinners: Mr. and Mrs. Bund, and Franck's. Both French. Service was impeccable, atmosphere lively and sophisticated, food terrific. What more can one ask. Drinks at Bar Rouge, M1NT and Lounge 18. Shanghai is definitely on its way to competing with the NY's and Londons of this world. Oct 31 2021 	great potential but they still have some work to do	My 9 year old daughter and I stayed at the new Peninsula for 3 nights during the second week of the soft opening. First the positives: rooms are beautiful and spacious; the closet/dressing room is huge, the bathroom is large and luxurious with separate bath and shower; the lobby is attractive (although the Lobby restaurant is too close to the hotel entrance); security is excellent, with security staff on the street and elevator access limited to guests with keys; there is a very large and welcoming staff, and every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted by more than 10 people; free international calls (and yes, this really works); they have a full time staff member at the airport to meet flights and send guests off, and he was able to help us check in for our Chicago flight in the business class line, even though we had coach tickets); good location just off the Bund (although Beijing road, just past the entrance, is crowded with tour busses and the sidewalks are jammed with tour groups); if you go in 2021 be aware that the river walk is completely closed as it is under construction for Expo 2020.Now the negatives:(I won't complain that the pool wasn't open as we had been told this in advance)check in: it took 3 tries for our room key to work when we checked ingym: good equipment but no headphones provided, no fruit (you get a towel and bottle of water when you walk in)water: you can't drink the water in China, and they supply water bottles with turn down service, but that is not enough water for tooth brushing and drinking during the day-they should supply more free water in the room (maybe stock a cabinet?)restaurants: we ate at the Lobby for breakfast daily (included in our room rate) and once for dinner, had room service dinner once, and had one dinner in the Cantonese restaurant. Each meal included between 1 and 5 errors: 2 billing errors (price on the bill was higher than the price on the menu-once in the Lobby, once in the Cantonese restaurant) and many errors about what we ordered (too numerous to list here). After the billing errors, they corrected the bills and apologized but did not offer to remove those items (as most luxury hotels in the US would have done). After the breakfast with at least 5 errors, I spoke to a manager to let him know that the wait staff was not able to understand all of our requests. concierge: although very friendly, they seem poorly trained. i asked one of them how long it would take to walk from the Pearl tv tower to the hotel, and he didn't know; then i asked if the tourist tunnel under the river was worth seeing, and he said he had never been there; these attractions are within easy walking distance of the hotel, and it seems odd that the concierge had never been there. We wanted to see an acrobat show and were not able to get tickets for the night we wanted-I don't think this makes sense at the Peninsula-they should have access to these tickets; when we got tickets for a different show, they said they would deliver the taxi directions to our room, but they never did.All of the above, I can attribute to the soft opening-everyone is still in training, and we knew we were coming during a &quot;soft opening&quot; so our expectations were not too high. But we did have one inexcusable negative experience. Our last night, the master light switch stopped working, and we were left with no ability to control the lights, in a pitch black room, with only the mood light on in the bathroom. I had to feel my way to the desk and use my computer screen as a light so that I could call the front desk. They sent a maintenance person up quickly, but it took him more than 15 minutes to figure out how to fix the lights. Being stuck in a dark room for so long was very disturbing, especially to my daughter. I called a manager and after about 20 minutes, she came to my room. I let her know how upset we were (what is the point of all those fancy controls if they don't work!) and asked her to consider adjusting our bill to reflect the light fiasco and some of the other poor service issues we had experienced.When we checked out, I was surprised to see that the bill had not been adjusted. (there was also a breakfast charge, which they promptly removed as our breakfast had been included in our rate); when i asked, the manager gave my 9 year old a teddy bear and told me she'd booked the Rolls Royce to take us to the airport. (our rate included ariport transfers). While we enjoyed the Rolls Royce, I still think they should have adjusted our bill and am certain that the Peninsula in Chicago (where we stay several times a year) would have adjusted the bill under similar circumstances. I will be traveling to China regularly on business and will think twice before returning to this hotel, unless I hear that they have sorted out their service issues. But it is beautiful, so I hope they can train their staff better to fit in with the luxurious surroundings. And I hope they are reading these reviews and taking steps to resolve the remaining issues. Oct 30 2021 	Don't go yet still need time...	We stayed 4 nights/5 days in the hotel. I will concede the hotel had been only opened for 3 days when we arrived but having the Peninsula badge one expects a certain level of competent service regardless of how new the hotel is. The room (an Executive Suite) was clean, nicely decorated and the welcoming chocolates from the hotel as well as a box of truffles from Armani was a nice touch. Upon unpacking we found out our room safe did not work and within moments front desk had dispatched personnel for an inspection. He was the first of two that evening. The next day the safe was still in-operable, another call went down, by the third day I gave up. I had by this time moved my valuables down to the lobby safe which was an inconvenience however I had no choice. The matter was finally solved the day before I left, when I mentioned this to the duty manager he was surprised to hear of it as he was only just informed of the situation! When I went down to the lobby safe to retrieve my valuables, the front desk clerk gently reminded me I have a room safe so it was unnecessary to have to use the lobby safe!During our stay the living room, bedroom and the bathrooms were always kept very clean. I have no complaints whatsoever with the housekeeping service. There is however a design flaw that can be a problem. In the changing room area the dressing table runs about 5' long, while very useful especially for women there is a 1 1/2&quot; gap between the wall and the edge of the table so if anything falls over you won't be able to access it, not even from the bottom as it is a sealed unit. The hairdryer is asthmatic so if you have long hair give yourself plenty of time because even at the highest fan and temperature setting it barely pumps out any hot air.The car service is a bit of a nightmare, I ordered a hotel car to fetch my daughter from her friend's house in the Pudong area (45 minutes away) The car was organized at 5:15 PM and I was assured the driver would be leaving immediately but the car did not pick up my child until almost 7 pm - we never made it to our dinner reservation that night.Our nightly rate included 2 American breakfasts (2 eggs, sausage, ham and bacon, yoghurt and granola parfait, fruit plate and toast) but the breakfast is so big neither my two daughters nor I envisioned eating it everyday for 4 days. We chose from the menu instead. The hotel should allow guests to chose their own items rather than enforce such a massive meal on individuals. To make matters worse, not one of our breakfast meal was correct - ever! The first day we had room service and even after three attempts to get it right we finally gave up, items ordered never showed even when asked for. Service in the lobby restaurant is just not what expects from a 5 star hotel. If you offer the service of pouring me a cup of tea then you had best pay attention to my cup content because I will NOT flag down wait staff to pour me a cup, DON&quot;T show up at my side as I'm pouring MYSELF a cup and tell ME it is your job - if it is your job then just do it!If I ask for the teapot to be moved closer to me just as it was about to be set down by the waitress DO NOT EVER frisbee the coaster from the other end of the table to me before coming around with the teapot! Secondly put the teacup down gently and not with a thud and a clank! This is more like dim sum hall service rather 5 star hotel service! Oct 22 2021 	Peninsula Shanghai – Day three (since opening) – the Room Tech facts	If there is one thing you won&quot;t be short of when you check into a room at the newly opened Peninsula Shanghai, it&quot;s a button to press. There is a myriad of them to choose from! In my standard room #723 (if such a thing exists at this luxurious establishment) there are no less that 29 panels containing various buttons, displays and sockets that you can press, read or plug things into.If there is one thing you won&quot;t be short of when you check into a room at the newly opened Peninsula Shanghai, it&quot;s a button to press. There is a myriad of them to choose from!In my standard room #723 (if such a thing exists at this luxurious establishment) there are no less that 29 panels containing various buttons, displays and sockets that you can press, read or plug things into.At the very comfortable desk, you can check the outdoor climate, to include wind velocity, and at an adjacent panel, it&quot;s possible to tune through a variety of internet radio channels. And if you still feel audio-deprived, an MP3/ ipod dock sitting above the unit permits audio playback via the hi-fi system just behind you near the big flat screen LCD TV.The 2-line sleek looking color screen desk IP phone – one of seven telephony-enabled units in the room permits free VOIP calls providing you first press the VOIP button. I tried it and it worked first time by following the simple on-screen instructions. The interface has 9 languages you can choose from, and if you want, you can pair a Bluetooth enabled device to the phone – such as a mobile phone for transferring the address book.Docking an iPOD is very straightforward, and my 3GS iPHONE worked a treat allowing me to playback my tunes. I did get a message when first docking to say it was not supported – but I pressed clear and there I was listening to The Beatles. However please note, that the unit does not charge the battery [at least on my unit] so watch out. Just above the iPOD dock on the wall, is a curtain control panel and that is mirrored on the other side – very easy to access and saves you standing up or walking 8 steps.On the side of the desk you can find a panel allowing HSIA connectivity (but no in-room supplied LAN cable), a legacy dial-up port, and a USB connector for the 4-in-one printer, fax, scanner copier that lives in a cupboard behind the desk. Again, no cable in the room. There is one power socket that is international style providing 220v and a 110v unit directly above it. Since most laptops come with auto-sensing power bricks, I guess you can say the desk has two power sockets. The same type of power sockets can be found by the TV, in the dressing area and bathroom. There are no easily available power sockets by the bed. Wi-Fi and wired broadband are free – a speedtest showed a 3Mb connection – using a LAN cable and a 100Mb port.The king size bed has night-stands on both sides and these are a mirror of each other with the same type of phone as the desk, plus a bedside control panel with another 29 buttons – seems they like the number 29 here. On the wall, there is a reading light control unit. The His and Hers controls are a nice touch but I wonder which one wins in controlling the TV...A wall unit behind the desk is a big feature in the room and houses the fax machine, Nespresso coffee maker, Mini bar fridge, DVD player, multimedia docking panel and LCD TV.The multimedia panel (concealed under the TV) has connectors and receptacles into which you should just about be able to plug everything in. This includes HDMI and four different SD/CF type cards from cameras and other digital media card using devices. The TV remote is used for the volume control. Sound reproduction is fairly crisp. There is a USB socket, but I suspect it&quot;s not for power, just files playback.As you enter the bedroom, there is (of course) a panel on your left side that can be pushed to choose one of four pre-set lighting moods, as well as let you increase or decrease humidity – dry or wet as they call it. Mine was showing 56%.The dressing area houses the room safe which is recessed into the wall, and hidden behind a panel where there is a press-type knob to release the door lock. The safe is big enough to house my 17&quot; MacBook Pro.By the mirror in the dressing area, can be found the signature nail dryer made famous by Fraser Hickox at the Peninsula Tokyo. Adjacent to that is another panel showing the outside temperature plus UV and humidity which really makes sense, since when you dress up, you need to know how many layers to wear before braving the elements. Next to that is a radio panel so you can listen to the news or your favorite local or internet based radio station. And just in case the phone rings, there is a wall-mounted handset within arms reach.A Butler box allows you to leave your laundry or shoes for polishing, and after pressing the valet call button, the valet should sprint along and pick up the items for servicing without bothering you, and this goes for returning them. It&quot;s now been more than two hours since I pressed the button, and my scuffed shoes are still there.The bathroom has two vanity units – one on either side of the room. One of them has an easily readable LCD clock on the wall, and the other is complete with A/V controls for the TV/music and a hands-free phone. There are of course power sockets at both vanity units for your toothbrush or where you can plug in the hotel supplied hairdryer.The bathtub is an area where you can control the TV, and make a phone-call - almost hands-free by utilizing the wall mounted control panel.Not to be outdone, the toilet cubicle has another phone that can be used in hands-free mode although it does have a handset as well. There is a Privacy button and Emergency Assistance call unit.Something to note is that all panels and switches are labeled in Chinese and English, and temperature controls can be switched from C to F.If you are seeking refuge from panels, switches and lights, there is just one area of the room which is free of such services and that&quot;s the shower cubicle. Here you can enjoy another type of power trip - a power shower.A nice product – my hat goes off to the Peninsula IT Team for putting it all together – I know what a struggle it must have been. And if there is one group who can make that happen – it&quot;s the PENINSULA.Another star is definitely born."
"Oct 25 2021 	Mixed Feelings	I am still here at the hotel and am checking out today. I have mixed feelings of this place. Positive: nice room decoration, large, well appointed room equipped with a printer, great bathroom, most staff friendly, good location for sightseeing or to Hongqiao/Gubei district, Chupa Chups at the reception (cute touch ;), nice view from the room if you are on the high floor, plenty of distilled water bottles in the room, etc...Well may be this has little to do with how comfortable the hotel is but the thing that disturbed me the most was the fact that we found few dead fish in the fish tanks on each floor EVRY DAY despite our attempts to correct the problem (we have written and called GM directly on two occasions). There are quite few fish tanks on each floor and they do add some flavor to the whole ambience of the hotel. However, if you find live fish feeding on the dead fish because they are so hungry right outside of your room, the whole desired effect is gone! This lack of attention to details equates to dirty toilet in a restaurant in my opinion. Imagine if you are at a posh restaurant. You find the food/service/atmosphere to your liking. Then you have to excuse yourself to go to the loo. And the toilet you find is a dirty mess! Also during our stay there was constant drilling and hammering noise from the construction site nearby and downstairs. We did not stay in the room the whole day so it was not too bad but despite the receptionist telling us all the construction stops at 6pm, some days it continued till 7pm. Most staff members are quite competent and friendly but I have found one girl (Ellen or Ely?) in the restaurant at 8th floor particularly unfriendly. Once my husband I went to have a breakfast there and although there was one other guest in the whole space, she told me to take a smaller table because she is expecting the place to be full. We did not follow her ‘instruction’ and took a bigger table for 4 by the window and from the beginning till the end of our breakfast, only two more guests arrived. She seemed angry the whole time we were there. What a nice way to begin a day! Next day at the breakfast I could not find a clean plate to put my food from the buffet so I asked the same girl, politely, ‘may I have a plate?’. She goes on with her chores without answering me so I said ‘excuse me?’ and she answered me with a very loud ‘YES (as in ‘I heard you!’). She also did not bring me the tea I asked for. As I mentioned, all other personnel I dealt with were polite and professional but it only takes only one person to destroy the whole experience in such a small establishment. Oh, and one last thing, we are in our late 30’s but sometimes we found the lighting in the room too dim. It would have been nice if we had a choice to dim it or brighten it. Sep 3 2021 	Amazing Hotel Big Problems	In 2018 I stayed at this hotel for 14 nights on three separate occasions. I keep going back, because it is quiet, well located, outstandingly designed with a wonderful attention to detail, the staff are friendly, helpful and very polite. The service is the best I have had anywhere. This is a truly wonderful boutique hotel. But you may be dissapointed.This boutique hotel reminds me of a very high performance italian sports car - a Lambourghini perhaps. Highly desirable, but you must put up with the problems.And there are definitely problems.Heating: The rooms are far too hot in winter and there is no way to cool them down as they only switch the air conditioning on during summer. And the windows open only a fraction. Noise: The hotel only has 8 floors so a bit of street noise excusable. However the famous nightclub on the ground floor makes a wild noise until 2.30am. When I had a room on the 5th floor my bed was shaking, the glass desk was vibrating and I could actually hear the DJ. When I moved to the 7th floor it was quiet. try and stay on the upper floors. The problem is that the hotel does not own the ground floor so they can do nothing about it. In October 2018 there was building work on the round floor. Jack hammers all day clearly heard from my room on the 7th floor.Plumbing: In all my visits I never managed to fill the uber-stylish bathtub. The water flow from the copper chrome taps was only a trickle. The massive tub looks amazing, so this is a real dissapointment.So why did I go back? Because it is just the most stylish, calming, discrete hotel I have stayed in with the best staff and a great location for doing business in Shanghai. Aug 23 2021 	what a disappointment.	Dead fish in the fish tanks. Ground floor facilities closed due to refurbishment. Constant hammering and drilling noise during days. Hopeless service; no concierge; receptionist refused to help change flights with airline even though I couldn't do it as I don't speak chinese. Inflexible: breakfast only for one even though I made a booking for two. We stayed four days. I asked if we could have two breakfasts on two days of our stay. Hotel staff refused. Breakfast was meagre and a disappointment anyhow. Staff lacking knowledge and unhelpful regarding tours. Not a good hotel for leisure travelers. Only good thing about the hotel, was the studio room and the hotel's location in the old French area of Shanghai. If you want a truly great boutique hotel experience in China, go to The Opposite House in Beijing instead. Book a studio 70 room. Brilliant service - staff will bend over backwards to help. Great facilities. Great food. Architecture and interior design, unique. Our room felt like the interior of Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House. Aug 5 2021 	Great Hotel	As some other people have said it is not necessarily easy to find since the entrance is at the side. Also Cab drivers do not always drive right up to it becasue of the one way system which entails quite a long loop around the main roads to get to it. Hard to fault the hotel. Rooms are very nicely decorated and adequate size, though the shower drainage system which surrounds the toilet is a little strange. Very nice attentive staff, The air conditional in the common areas such as corridors and bar / restaurant at the top of the hotel, could be better. Make sure you do take advantage of the free happy hour drinks / snacks. Well worth while after a hot day of sightseeing. Otherwise the price of food and drink is quite expensive - for example about $6 US for a cup of coffee in the morning. The location of the hotel is great right next to Fuxing Park which has some great atmospheric sights at all times of day and it well within walking distance to restaurants and bars.All in all a great place to stay Jul 30 2021 	Once you find it it's a GREAT hotel.	We arrived on a dark rainy night, and got a little frantic when we went to the front of the bldg &amp; all the signs said 'closed for remodeling'. You have to go around to the back of the bldg to find the entrance - and it is poorly lit, but don't get discouraged!The lobby is very small, dimly lit, but nice. But the room was great. Big, clean as a whistle, great air con, gorgeous huge bathroom, swell amenities. We booked on CTRIP and breakfast was NOT included with our rate. Be sure to ask when you're booking, cause it's pricey to add on. We ate there once - for convenience. Very quiet/small restaurant. We decided to go out on our own on the other days. We loved the location (we're walkers) - right next to FUXING Park. We'd go back in a heartbeat. Jul 15 2021 	Perfect hotel in every way	Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of a 2 week holiday in China. I thought the room was perfect: very spacious, enormous comfortable bed, immaculate bathroom with drenching shower and a free standing tub you could have a party in. Everything was beautifully and tastefully designed. it was perfect for relaxing after a day out. It was also very reasonably priced given the above. There was a restaurant but didn't eat there.I also found the location great. It is in the 'french concession' area which is littered with interesting bars, restaurants and shops. There seemed to be a nice mix of locals, tourists and ex-pats out and about. It is a short stroll from some major shopping streets, a slightly longer walk to the shanghai old town area and a cheap taxi ride to the Bund.For tourists wanting to discover the variety of shanghai I would say it is a much better option than the internationl high rise hotels that abound elsewhere. Jun 27 2021 	Far exceeded my expectations with only a few negatives	I come to Shanghai several times a year for business. I almost always have stayed on the Bund or in other popular areas with business travelers. Le Royal Meridien Shanghai was my most common default place for comparison.Pudi Boutique Hotel was suggested by a colleague who stayed here a month ago, so I decided to try it. I travel a lot and rarely am wowed by a hotel room. This one did it. I stayed in one of the &quot;Studio Rooms&quot; and it has a large and comfortable king-size bed, with a flat-screen TV easily viewable. The TV itself is part of a &quot;shelf&quot; that swivels 360 degrees, so that you can watch the TV from the large desk opposite the bed. The opposite side of the TV is a classy bar with nice glass ware.The sitting area is glass-enclosed; the bathroom has a large tub, a walk-in shower wet room with rain forest shower head; the dual-sinks and washing-up area are well stocked, and the toilet area has a built-in magazine rack. The closets are large enough for my week stay, and are accessible from both the bathroom and the hallway (the closets are built into the hallway/bathroom divider, and have doors on both sides).Free wired internet in the room with ethernet cable included. Free printer in the room (USB cable included). Free breakfast included - both in the restaurant AND for in-room dining. Free cocktail hour in the evening. Free gym with one treadmill, one bike, a large set of free weights, and a universal machine. I never had anyone else in there when I used it.The downsides are only negative if you aren't expecting them:- There is only one restaurant in the hotel and it's not often other people are there. The menu isn't huge, so if you're a picky eater, you may eat the same meal more than once if you eat there often.- The location isn't as fun as The Bund - there's not a lot around the hotel itself. I'm not too adventurous for food, so I didn't try any local restaurants. The area feels quite residential actually. I did discover that within walking distance there's a shopping mall and cinema (Transformers and Terminator playing at the moment in English), so maybe I just didn't explore the area enough. But you should expect to taxi when you want to go somewhere.I think I've found my new hotel for Shanghai. Jun 26 2021 	FRINDLY STAFF AND BUT LACK OF KNOWLEDGE	Staff was very friendly , beautiful ...but staff lack of city knowledge and hotel knowledge Nov 20 2018 	Nice but sligthly overrated	Nice room with a great bathroom (lovely big bath), helpful staff and good location, but we felt it didn't really live up to the great reviews below. Not a bad choice though. Nov 8 2018 	a truly luxurious boutique hotel	It is not often that the hotel photos match reality but this did. Our suite was superbly comfortable and stunning to look at. The staff from our warm and friendly manager down to the young lady at the door were attentive and helpful. The position was ideal for exploring but still an oasis of calm.We cannot find anything to fault and recommend it to anyone especially, as we were told, &quot;if you want a soft landing&quot; for your first China experienceJenny and David Goldstein, Australia Sep 24 2018 	Pudi: great rooms and great staff!	My partner and stayed in Pudi Boutique Hotel for three nights last week (until 21 September) in a deluxe room. It was the most luxurious hotel room we had in our week long stay in China. We especially liked the stereo system in the swiveling bar in our room. The glass-enclosed bathroom was very spacious. The shower a bit dark and the toiletries not as nice as elsewhere, but the provision of two types of bathrobes, crispy white sheets, complimentary bottled water and a handy kitchenette more than compensated.The entrance to the hotel is at the back of the building, but staff are standing on the lookout all the time to help first time visitors. The location next to Fuxing Park and close to the restaurants and shops in the French Concession makes it ideal. Taxi's and metro are cheap and easy. The hotel staff were very helpful, translating destinations for us so that we could communicate with taxi drivers. They staff speak English well.Facilities inlcude a small but well equipped gym. Pity that the buffet breakfast closes at 10.30 am even on a Sunday.Would recommend this hotel to adults, looking for a bit of luxury and tranquility away from the big chain hotels. Sep 13 2018 	Truly excellent	This is all you could want in a hotel. The website didn't give away much information so I was hesitant to book, but am so glad I did. Excellent location, extremely friendly and helpful staff and best of all, the rooms. They're excellent - spacious, kitted out with beautiful objects and artwork, lovely soft beds and those great thick hotel sheets, a window seat overlooking the park below, a huge and luxurious bathroom with separate deep oval bath, and the best robes. We wandered up to the hotel bar during happy hour and whilst we sat at the large windows overlooking the city lights, we sampled excellent wine and hors d'ouvres FOR FREE! After Pudi we went to Paris and stayed in a luxury hotel, and all we could think about was Pudi. My advice - don't hesitate, just book the Pudi. Sep 10 2018 	Mom loved it	After my mother announced to visit me in Shanghai, I really wanted to make it for her a very special experience. That fore I visited several hotels in Shanghai to find the very best. Finally I ended up with the decision for the Pudi Boutique Hotel Fuxing Park. Why? The style and the location of the hotel! The hotel is located right next to Fuxing Park at the crossing of Yandang Lu and Nanchang Lu. You can walk to Huaihai Lu within 5 minutes and reach Xintiandi by walk in less than 15 minutes.When you arrive at the crossing you maybe won't find the hotel very quick, because the entrance is a little bit hidden. But there arrived nice hotel employees open the door and welcome you in a very dark reception area. You feel more like in a club than in a hotel, this makes it very special. After a very short check of your passport your floor manager will guide you to your room, where you first proceed the in-room check-in which is done very quick by a single signature. After wards you will be introduced to all room functions and features.The rooms are really beautiful decorated with high-quality furniture on over 50 sqm. You feel like in a mix of art and furniture exhibition because of the very good condition of the rooms. In Shanghai you often find very hard beds which sometimes are not very comfortable for European backs. This hotel offers great soft beds and an extraordinary complimentary pillow menu. The bathroom offers plenty of space, a bathtub with massage function, a rain forest shower as well as two sinks. The desk offers a lot of space as well as complete office equipment and a printer.Other amenities of this hotel where the outstanding service and the roof terrace, which offers a stunning view over the French Concession area as well as a outdoor jacuzzi. Your floor manager is always reachable for you and gives his very best to have yourself a pleasant stay.The breakfast is served on the 8th floor. A small but fine buffet offers a choice of cereals, a lot of fruits, Swiss cheese and more... additionally you can order from their breakfast menu. I recommend the &quot;champagne scrambled eggs&quot; which makes your start of the day even more special. My mother finally stayed two nights at the Pudi in a Studio Room and really enjoyed her time there. She had never seen anything comparable to this hotel style and it's service before. Sep 7 2018 	Perfect place in a perfect area	We just returned from a 4 weeks trip in China, that was started by a 3 nights stay at the Pudi hotel in Shanghai, and that finished there too with one additional night.We loved the hotel for it's brilliant decoration and the kindness, competence and availability of the staff.The Pudi hotel has been rated by our kids &quot;best hotel in China&quot;! Feb 17 2018 	Terrific little place	I gave this place 5/5 based on value for money.Stayed here for 2 nights in late January and chose this place because of trip advisor. I booked the room through sofitels website. If you book 15 days in advance you get a good discount, so I ended up paying about US$150.00.The staff were friendly and efficient and spoke surprisingly very good english. Other reviews at other hotels in Shanghai seem to complain about the level of english of staff.Room was grand with comfy bed, large new bathroom, and spotlessly clean. It was hard to fault. There are fish tanks all over the place. Groovy.Breakfast was delicious. The second morning I flew out early so asked for room service. Apparently the earliest you can get it is 6.30am. I nevertheless put down 6am on the form and it arrived at 6am!The only 2 minor issues I had here were that on a Saturday night there is a disco on the ground floor. A previous reviewer mentions this so I booked a quiet room and was put on the top floor. I could hardly hear the disco and it did not keep me awake. Secondly, the shower's plumbing was a little dodgy and water was leaking underneath the tiles. This reduced the pressure from the shower head which was ashame.Overall a terrific little hotel and I loved my stay here.GrahamAUSTRALIA Feb 16 2018 	Highly recommended	We chose this new hotel based on reviews in tripadvisor and were not disappointed. The standard and size of the accommodation was superb for the base rate we paid, and the facilities in the room were far beyond that found in grander establishments. The friendly, helpful staff have been well trained by their new Dutch manager, who makes himself accessible to his guests. Any minor teething problems (some have been mentioned in earlier posts) are acknowledged and being resolved and should in no way discourage future travellers. This is not an hotel for backpackers on a tight budget or those chasing loyalty points in some faceless high-rise. Business travellers will be delighted with the office space, solo females with the level of security, and tourists with the haven of peace and quiet where staff address you by name. More than worth a visit. Feb 3 2018 	Boutique through 	Great hotel, service attentive. Stayed in the junior suite so very spacious. good restaurants nearby. didn't eat in the rest. as only there for 4 nights! Good breakfasts. Loved the style and atmosphere. Manager there at breakfast time to say hello.booked through accor. asia website &amp; got a better deal than if booking with accor.com Jan 17 2018 	Close to perfect	Pudi is very close to the perfect hotel. Reception staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, you're checked in by your own personal butler and given a quick tour of everything before being shown to your room. Rooms are large and lavishly appointed (in an understated and tasteful way, apart from the Dallas-esque bar). Beds are supremely comfortable, bathrooms feature jacuzzi baths and large rainforest showers and everything you might possibly want or need has been provided. Breakfast is impressive and the location is central. However, we had a couple of issues. One was the nightclub on the ground floor - we could hear music from it unitl 2.30am one night (and we were six floors above it). To be fair, staff offered to move us to another room when we rang to ask how long it would continue, but moving room's not really a solution at 1am, and obviously is only an option when the hotel's not full. Our other issue was that the room was extremely warm and the aircon had been set for hot air only. Our final issue was that the hotel hosted a fashion show one evening which meant that breakfast on that morning finished earlier than usual, and was uncomfortable because people from the show were standing over guests, hustling them out of the dining room which was to be set up for the show. Otherwise, top marks to Pudi. Jan 14 2018 	Great find in great area in Shanghai	Pudi Boutique Hotel is run by the Accor Hotel Group but it behaves like an exclusive boutique hotel. Stayed there for 3 nights and couldn't be more pleased. The hotel is brand new and the room was great- I especially liked the huge bathroom. Breakfast on the top floor of this 8 floor hotel is not to be missed-- try the vanilla french toast. Overall, a great experience in a great location in Shanghai. Close to the Dragonfly massage spa where we got foot massages each night! Oct 6 2007 	Cool and funky finding by Fuxing Perk	I agree with all that the previous reviewer has to say about this small,comfortable and friendly hotel. Staff speak good English (which is not always the case in Chinese hotels).Rooms have all manner of gadgetry but are also comfortable, relaxing and user friendly. Great beds spacious bathrooms and free internet access. The business traveller will find the desk drawer full of office equipment and there is a printer/fax in all rooms. Atmospheric public area lighting is not always the brightest but soothing and restful.The top floor houses a restaurant, bar, meeting room, small gym and roof terrace. Good breakfasts are served by friendly and attentive staff.Situated within easy walking distance of Xintiandi where there are numerous restaurants and shops. Do find time to stroll around Fuxing Park particularly in the morning when hundreds of locals gather for exercises and social dancing.Only opened in June '07, rates are currently well below the published tariff (see [-]). This hotel is run by Accor Hotels but is not really a Sofitel despite appearing as such on the web site. Jul 29 2007 	Pudi is great for business or pleasure!	Pudi Boutique hotel is a great choice in Shanghai! The website does it no justice, as this really is a gem of a hotel!It is a smaller boutique/design hotel, with around 50 rooms. The staff were very friendly, and very helpful in every possible way. The service is truly top notch.Pudi is located just next to Fuxing Park, in the French Concession. It's convenient location made walking out for dinner, drinks, and shopping very easy.The rooms are incredible in terms of decor. It was a successful marriage of modern, chic style and ammenities, with a predominately chinese feel. The entrance to each room has a large fish tank built into the wall, as well as an enormous tank in the lobby. Inside the rooms, an entire wall is windows, with a view of either the park or the street, with the blinds controlled by remote. The King bed is very comfortable, and we especially enjoyed the 'pillow menu,' where upon arriving you get to order which pillows you would like for your stay. The bathroom is stunning- a wet room for the shower, and the biggest stand along bath tub we have possibly ever seen. Rooms are divided in half, so to speak, with a tv in the center that is on a stand that swivels around. On one side is the bedroom part, and on the other a large desk with phone, fax, printer..., some chairs to relax in, and the other side is the bed.The top floor of Pudi is the restaurant, gym, bar, lounge, and outdoor terrace... again, all beautifully designed, very elegant, and with stellar service.The water in Shanghai is undrinkable, and the hotel is excellent at giving plenty of bottled water to guests. Everytime we returned to our room, there would be at least six new bottles of water.If travelling to Shanghai on either business if pleasure, Pudi is a great choice! Aug 29 2021 	??????????

"Nov 4 2021 	Surprised!	Stayed at Shanghai Pullman Skyway on Oct 14 and 16..was really impressed by the sizes of the rooms on both stays! HUGE rooms with the comfy queen's sized bed and the toilet was sooo clean! The size of the room really threw me off guard...tv was good as well, with a wide selection of channels. It's about 15 min walk from Luban station, almost 40 minute cabride from Pudong airport. Breakfast at Zafraan was disappointing...the view from Le Ciel was awesome though. Oct 23 2021 	best hotel in shanghai	We stayed last weekend in this hotel, me, my husband, our son and my parents.We arrived at 10 a.m. but they were able to give us one room an managed to give us the second one on the same floor, as we asked.The hall is very kitsch! You won't forget it! Take a look at the lamps in the whole hotel: really really bad taste!! Kind of funny..But the room (normal one) is huge, plenty of space for a baby bed and for our son to crawl around. Very new and modern, with comfortable bed, desk and chairs. The bathroom is also very spaciuos with bath tub and shower.The only negative thing was the concierge: we asked for directions and she sent us exactly in the opposite direction.. so after that we just consulted our map and didn't ask anything!Breakfast has a lot of good pastries, chinese food, sushi, eggs, bacons, fruits.. pretty much anything you like. And you have a very nice view from the 49th floor.The location is very good: you can walk to Huai Huai Lu and Xi Tiandi. Takes about 15-20 minutes to get to Pudong by taxi.We have been in many different hotels in Shanghai, but this is for me the best one, because it is new, prices are low, rooms are very big and the location is good.Oh! Parking is also complimentary, never happened before in Shanghai!Internet is also complimentary and worked fine, could skype with Austria in good quality. Oct 20 2021 	disappointed	I decided to stay at pullman because of the positive reviews I saw. but ended up with a less than satisfactory stay. I'm writing this review from my hotel room.I had previously stayed in other pullman hotels and had good experiences.Pros:1)good location2) relatively new3) executive room is bigCons:1) unstable internet connection - my internet connection was intermittent. (staying in executive floor room)when i called the operator, she said nothing she can do, need to wait for IT dept to come in at 9am the following day. to me, stable internet connection is a basic requirement for a hotel catering to business clients. and most other hotels I've stayed in have IT help on call but not this one.2) as I was still breastfeeding my kid, I brought my cooler bag and also expressed milk during my trip. as the hotel room fridge is only a cooler and not a proper bar fridge, I requested the hotel staff to help me keep my milk(which have been packed and sealed properly in a cooler bag) in the hotel frrezer. They said no, can't do that. which is the first in the few 5 star hotels I've visited. and made similar requests. after I kicked up a fuss, threaten to see the manager and luckily I'm fluent in mandarin, they finally relented. but the damage is done. I left feeling very upset.3) water temperature in the shower is unstable. I tried to take a shower and the water keep shifting from very hot to cold and that made taking a shower quite uncomfortable. 4) Bed was not comfortable. It's similar to the type of beds (i.e. hard) in chinese run 5 star hotels, catering more to the local chinese preferences. 5) when I tried to call operator a few times. I had to wait very long.... they should have more pple manning the line! Aug 1 2021 	Amazing hotel in a great area	I have just spent 10 nights in this hotel and will stay here again. This hotel is still being transformed by Accor into a Pullman and every change they are making is a good one.Check in was easy, I found the desk staff courteous and efficient and have to thank Rainbow who was the duty manager, she made a error on behalf into a positive situation – I was very impressed.We were in a junior suite which was very comfortable, a good size, good bathroom with separate shower and a very comfortable bed. I generally stay at Sofitel but am a Pullman convert. Pullman is not a family oriented hotel, which we appreciate, so nice not to have rug rats around.We used the hotel restaurants and found the dinner buffet good value and a new seafood buffet was launched why we were there, good variety of seafood and non seafood dished, any buffet offering Beijing Duck is a winner with me, although the dishes do change daily. Breakfast was good and we enjoyed the eclipse from the restaurant – great views, but after a few days we started skipping breakfast and going to the dum sum buffet in the Chinese Restaurant on level 3, it is popular and really good value, good food and great service. The service in all restaurants was food.The Hotel is in a good location, walking distance to a few supermarkets, plenty of restaurants and a short cab ride to any of the city sites it is a short walk to Taikang Lu and the former residence of Sun Yat-sen two Shanghai must sees. There is also a subway station opening in this area soon which will be a bonus, but taxies are still easier and very reasonable. Luwan is a good area and has a lot to offer, the French Concession is well worth taking the time to explore.We enjoyed our stay and are already planning our return trip and will stay in the Pullman again. Jul 30 2021 	One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in!	From entering the spacious lobby we saw that this was something special but when we saw our room we thought that there had been some mistake as it seemed that we had been allocated a small suite! Luxurious massive extra king-sized bed with plenty of room to store cases, bags, cameras etc. etc.The bathroom was out of this world and provided a panoramic view of the city (we were on the 33rd floor) from a bath with an unobstructed view through massive windows. Service was fantastic from breakfasts on the 49th floor to a cozy bar on the 50th floor which enjoyed probably one of the best views of a city we have ever seen. Staff were always friendly and even though few spoke English we were always able to make ourselves understood with little effort on our part.Swimming pool looked amazingly welcoming but unfortunately we didn't have time to use it!Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for tourists and probably business clients as they had extensive conference facilities. Staying here really put the shine on an already fascinating visit to China. Jul 29 2021	You're in good hands here.	Unlike some places in China, the Pullman doesn't merely look like a good hotel; it really is a good hotel. Everything works, the staff are knowledgeable and helpful and the food is OK. The restaurant and carvery serve wines from all over the world, wines you have heard of. No sign of Great Wall or Goldenball (this is good). They do room service and that's good. The hotel has its own minibuses which work out cheaper than taxies if you want to go out as a small group. This is a proper hotel. Jul 24 2021 	Really enjoyed this lovely hotel	We had 2 seperate 3 night stays at this hotel with our 3 small children and enjoyed our time at the Pullman. The first night we arrived the property was full and we were unable to get the connecting rooms that we had requested but the following day we were upgraded to connecting executive rooms. The rooms are very nice and very spacious. We had rooms on 39th floor so the views were great. Bathrooms were beautful with seperate shower and baths (i would prefer that there was a wall between bathroom and the room which there wasn't in the executive rooms but they did have a curtain). Breakfast on the 49th floor was good but a bit expensive. Rooms Service Menu was also expensive with no real options for the kids. We had a babysitter (Anna &amp; Gretta) arranged through housekeeping on 2 occasions which the kids enjoyed. One of the nights we went upstairs to the Blue Bar (50th floor) which was beautiful. Around the hotel there were quite a few really good local restuarants well within walking distance. Taxis were easy enough to get and cheap. Metro was not too far but Taxi's were easier. We were really glad we picked the Pullman, Staff were excellent and we enjoyed our stay. Jun 26 2021 	A fantastic hotel that will only get better once the new Metro line opens	I finished a recent trip around China with 3 nights in the Pullman Skyway, as a little treat to myself.I arrived at the hotel at around 10.30am, after a 12 hour overnight train journey from Beijing so was desperately in need of a shower! I didn't even need to ask the receptionist if an early check-in was possible as she immediately assigned my room (and upgraded me to a suite!)The hotel itself has only been open since April, it occupies the top half of a new 50 storey tower. If you've stayed in a Pullman before, you'll know that they're along the lines of a modernised Sofitel and this one certainly didn't disappoint. They also include free internet connection in your room rate, so no paying obscene access charges in your room. The Health Club and Swimming Pool is also very nice, and was certainly welcome after a long day in the smog, heat and humidity of Shanghai.The staff are very attentive, without appearing pushy, and were only too happy to give me a rundown of their city as a first time traveller.The only negative thing I could say about the hotel is that the Metro stop is currently about a 10-15 minute walk. However, as with most things in Shanghai, the Metro is expanding rapidly and a new line is shortly opening that will be around a 2 minute walk from the hotel, so this will certainly rectify that.As for location, it's slightly to the West of the centre, so the journey to Nanjing St (the main shopping area, and heart of Shanghai) takes around 10-15 minutes by taxi or Metro.I'd certainly recommend this hotel, you can't fail to be impressed by it. Jun 20 2021 	Not worthy Pullman brand	This hotel has changed management to Pullman, and has a long way to go before it lives up to this. Rooms are quite big with large bathrooms. Apart from that both the rooms and the rest of the hotel is very impersonal. Worst part is the restaurants, absolutely no atmosphere, unless you consider blue lighting nice. Feels more like an apartment complex with some mediocre sterile restaurants. Breakfast average, too low capacity compared to the size of the hotel and helpless service. Kind of in the middle of nowhere. Would not recommend it. There is a reason the price is not too high. Jun 20 2021 	Not a good experience	If you are an A-Club member don't bother asking for an upgrade as they don't understand the rules at all. I spent 45 minutes at check in with my platinum card, requested an upgrade and 4 staff members later was told it was not in the rules. The food is very average. The buffet never changes except for the carvery dish, which seems to alternate on consecutive evenings. Very boring and very average. Waited 40 minutes for a glass of wine which seems to come from a differnt floor. The service was terrible constantly, and we twice witnessed a concierge staff member who we knick named &quot;Rocky&quot;, assaulting guests, who we think were jumping a taxi line. Rocky wouldn't leave things. After his initial pushing, shoving and abuse in chinese he would walk away and then return to the guest who was doing nothing for another go ! It was unbelievable. This happenned twice and the rest of the staff just looked on giggling. Not a nice place to stay and not the usual pullman standard. Jun 14 2021 	Average in comparison with other Pullman in SEA	Stayed at a number of other Pullman's, but the Skyway is well below the standard of the ones in Xian and Bangkok.Positive:Nice recreational facilitiesComplimentary internet accessGreat views on high floorsNice bathroomsNegative:Club floor rooms are not worth the money, small and bland roomsFront line staff not overly helpful (asked for the nearest Starbucks and was given three times different directions by the same person)Club lounge canapes poor in quality and quanitityVery limited English TV chanelsOverall not up to the standard of other Pullmans, but maybe I am just spoiled after staying at the fantastic Xian and Bangkok Pullmans Jun 9 2021 	perfect hotel	This is a truely unexpected and unbeliavable experience! The hotel was great, the rooms were clean and tidy beyond expectation! the service was good as well. The environment was superb! Deco was modern and attractive. Though the food in the restaurant was not as 5 stars as it suppose to be but the environment compensate the whole thing! May 24 2021 	Probably the Best I'll Stay in My Life!	I stayed here for about 3 nights in May 2021, as part of a tour I took with China Spree. We stayed here unexpectantly, China Spree arranged it at the last minute for whatever reason and I am sooo happy they did. The hotel was not only the best one I stayed on the tour, but probably will be the best I'll ever stay in my lifetime! The hotel seems to cater to traveling professionals/executives, with conference/meeting rooms on the 2nd floor. The lobby is fantastic and impressive, with a huge color-changing chandelier thing on the ceiling and a large fish tank behind reception/concierge.The service at the hotel was also excellent. I was really impressed that they treated everyone so well (and I was far from dressed as a professional, I dressed pretty backpacker-ish in cargo pants and t-shirts). From the bell boys to the restaurant staff, I've never been so well-received as a guest. The rooms were great! I had a single and the bed was deliciously comfortable, which is rare in China, where most beds are pretty stiff. This one was just perfect--not too stiff, not too soft. Room for me was quite large too. Showers were really nice too, and good English/Chinese selection on TV. For the most part, I really thought my room was super clean, the only bad thing was on my last night while lying around watching TV, I found a clipped toe nail in my sheets. :( Definitely not mine, but that was the single bad thing I found with the hotel...The breakfast buffet is pretty good, and better yet it's up on the 49th floor! Or 50th...somewhere high on top so you can get a great view of the city. Don't bother getting goods at the bakery on the first floor, you can get them at the breakfast buffet! Food was a mix of Chinese and American continental.Pool was indoor, I didn't go in but checked it out and looked nice. There are also gym/spa facilities.Internet is quite expensive. I forget the price, but whatever they charged for 15 min. was the same of what Guilin/Xian charged for like an hour or so! Location--can't really comment since we had a shuttle bus to take us around the city. But taxis are everywhere and cheap.I would highly recommend the Pullman Shanghai Skyway Hotel! It was a nice 'luxurious' stay to the end of my 2 week trip around China! May 19 2021 	lovely new efficient hotel	had 2 nights here - the rooms are large and comfortable with spectacular views - especially the 50th floor restuarant .bit away from downtown Apr 24 2021 	Excellent Hotel	We enjoyed our stay at Pullman Shanghai. The Deluxe room was huge and equipped with every amenity expected of a 5 star hotel and most of all comfortable beds. The location may be a bit far off from the subway line but it didn't bother us as taxi was an easy and expensive to travel around. The Luwan District was quite centrally located and in close proximity all hotpots in Shanghai.Will definitely stay at this hotel again! Feb 2 2021 	Convenient and Comfortable	I was born in Shanghai and now residing in Taiwan. I really enjoyed every minute staying at this new hotel with my wife and kids during my recent visit back in Shanghai. It is, from a Shanghainese point of view, one of the most convenient hotels in town, given its easy access to city centre, freeway, railway station, and commercial district, all within 15-20 min drive. The rooms are well-designed and decorated with large bathroom, better than any of the 5-star hotels nearby. The only pity maybe the price of beverages a bit higher than average, with a bottle of Evian costing RMB 50. Dec 1 2008 	Best location on PuXi side	This hotel has the best location on Puxi side, 10 mins taxi ride to Xintindi(dining and entertainment district) and walk distance to art and design area call Bridge 8 and Tianzifang. 20mins taxi ride from Hongqiao domestic airport and 45mins taxi ride from Pudong international airport. Hotel has a beautiful lobby and nice outdoor cafe. Breakfast serve the best donut in China, I have to say it's better than Dunkin Donuts. Bar on 48 floor also offer nice view of Shanghai. There is a Cantonese style restaurant around the corner open 24 hours, good place for quick lunch or late night snack.Room is very clean and modern, staffs are very friendly. I have stayed at many 4~5 stars hotels in Shanghai, Skyway offer the best of all. I had a great experience during my 4 days stay. Nov 17 2008	Excellent Beautiful Hotel	We stayed here with our tour group ChinaSpree for 3 nights in November. Beautiful hotel, clean nice, quiet room and beautiful bathroom. Everyone from the front desk to the maids were wonderful. They ran out of my husband's beer and told him they would have it back by the next night when we showed up they did not have it but the hostess went to the store and brought some back for him. Easy cab ride to everything - Shanghai Acrobats, The Bund, The Knock off market, the Bazaar and the Jade Buddah Temple and the Shanghai Museum. Would definitely recomend and the breakfast was wonderful with french pastries, sushi, western items - yummy! Highly reccomend. Any questions - I would be happy to answer them for you. Nov 12 2008 	Could not fault it	We stayed here in October 2008 and were highly impressed with the Skyway. Firstly, the staff - they were all so friendly, helpful and eager to help, from the housekeepers to the receptionists to the porters. I don't think I have been anywhere so welcoming!They helped with where to go, even drawing a map to the nearest pharmacy and translating 'asprin' for me on a card to present to the staff in the chemist ( I had a banging headache at the time!).The hotel itself is in a good location - we never waited long for a taxi (which is such a cheap way to get around) - by the way, ask for the attractions card from reception. You can then present this to the taxis drivers when you want to get somewhere. It was spotlessly clean, the room spacious (it was a deluxe room but the price was not much more than standard).Nice plasma screen, high quality furnishings, lots of attention to detail. Above all, its exceptional value for a hotel of this standard. Apr 12 2008 	good new First Class Hotel	the Skyway Landis Hotel seems to be pretty new. The staff still struggles with the service but is extremly friendly. The restaurants in the hotel are average, the bar ok but always practically empty. The rooms are very nice and modern.I have selected this hotel for business reasons , so if you have business to do in this area of SHA then it is for sure the best choice. It is as well in walking distance to the &quot;old&quot; part of Shanghai with many great restaurants (western food as well) and many little butiques. Actually found in this corner of SHA the best Italian Restaurant you can find in SHA (called Pasta &amp; Pizza). Dec 31 2007 	Reasonable place to stay in Shanghai	Stayed here for two nights during a weekend trip. Landis is a good Taiwanese hotel chain, and this is a brand new property in Shanghai. The hotel is tall and the colorful top can be seen from far away at night.Rooms are very large and comfy, with soothing decor. However the details in the decor are poor if u look beneath the surface. Service was a little lacking as it was still new when I stayed.Location was OK but not the most convenient. Oct 27 2007 	Nice new hotel that can hold its own against the big names	The Landis properties in Taiwan are usually very good (perhaps the best hotel chain no one has ever heard of?), so this was a natural choice, even more so because the price was right. The rooms were big and the food was great. They are still working out some kinks since this is a new hotel (i.e. not all of the restaurants are open, but the breakfast buffet on the 49th floor is very good). The gym is a little bit on the small size for a swanky property of this scale, but big enough, plus the pool is huge, with a view of a neighboring park. The Parriss buffet in the basement is a seafood lovers dream (and a seafood haters nightmare).The only big negative I found is the smoking issue, but this seems to be this way everywhere in Shanghai. The non-smoking restaurant sections seem to still get lots of smoke. My non-smoking room still had matches and an ashtray in it (but did not smell like smoke at all). Also, the staff's English skills seem to be lacking, and non-Mandarin speakers might have some trouble with housekeeping, etc.. The maid left a rag in my sink, but no big deal and she apologized profusely when I saw her and handed it back to her in the hallway. This hotel is located in an upscale residential area, but taxi rides to Pudong and major eating/shopping centers were quick and cheap. Aug 4 2007 	Exceptional Service - Well Priced!	This is a stunning hotel which would be in the top 10 hotels in Shanghai....It doesn't seem to ever have many guests given that it is still new and hasn't built up such a reputation as of yet but having paid US$100 each night on a discounted booking website you really can't go wrong.The best hotels in Shanghai are the Hyatt, the Meridien Royal, the Shangri-la and the Westin on the bund. However, it would be difficult to find these below US$250-300 a night. This is not the case with Skyway Landis which offered a very good international 5 star hotel (high level rooms, e.g. 30th-50th floors, a large indoor pool, sauna, gym etc and good service from the staff).....Would definately return to this hotel for good service and a reasonably well priced stay in what is otherwise cheap Shanghai.... Jul 11 2007 	Good hardware but bad software	For being a newly opened 5-star hotel, it used all high class hardware (i.e. sanitary facilities, and a 42&quot; LCD TV of &quot;Panasonic etc.), the location is also very good and near the city center. However, the services provided (software) needs a lot to be improved. I requested the reception whether I can have a late checkout at 1430 a day before checkout, and they said alright. So, I go out for some shopping before leaving Shanghai. Unfortunately, when I got back to my room at 1300, my door key is inactivated and when I asked a housekeeper that floor whether she can open the door for me to put those stuffs into my room first and then I would go to the reception to see what had happened, she refused to do anything and urged me to the reception. Then, I was carrying all my stuffs and went back to the reception at ground floor. I asked them whether my keys were incabable of open the door because of the late checkout? And their answer very promptly was &quot;Yes, it does.&quot; They thought it was usual and no guilty to asked a client to re-activite their door card after usual checkout time even he had had asked them for this favour just last night.Things to remember : 1) the degree showed on the monitor of the air conditioning is not trustable, when it indicated that the room temperature was 27 Celcius, the actual temperature was much lower, bewared to have a cold.2)they only provide feather quilted cover and you will properly get all wet by sweating at the middle of nights!God Bless everyone who are going to take this hotel! Jul 11 2007 	??????????"
"Jul 22 2021 	Excellent both facilities and services	A perfect business hotel - perfect service, room, food, great gym, nice pool, good location.especially their outside swimming pool....next time I will continue to stay this hotel. Apr 18 2021 	Great hotel and a great location	This is a great hotel with spotless rooms and great service. It is minutes from downtown with a taxi ride of about 3 dollars from most major tourist areas. Hotel is very affordable and comes across as a five star. Great views from the higher floors of the whole city or river. Jan 23 2021 	Very nice - but not for people with fear of heights	This hotel was a sigh for sore eyes, after having travelled for hours. If you are afraid of heights, stay away. I am not usually effected by heights, but this was a little frightening.The rooms very large, and very comfortable. I stayed in one room with my sister and ordered room service. We didn't have to wait for too long, and it tasted great. Jan 7 2021 	Best stay Abroad	Purple Mountain is amazing. first impression is absolutly positive when you are in the huge lobby, two ladies in black dresses playing Piano and fluette, amazing atmosphere. the room was spaciuos with a study desk, fax machine, the bathroom had a bathtub and separate shower, you will find in the room everything you need, from Iron and Iron stand, Umbrella, tea set with complimentary tea bags..etc.Next time I go to shanghai, I will forsure stay in Purple Mountain Dec 8 2018 	Death trap	I just spent one night at the Purple Mountain Hotel with colleagues. Due to a fire at the hotel, we had to leave in the middle of the night and book into another hotel (Grand Hyatt, warmly recommended). That as such was not too bad, accidents happen. But in this case the fire was in the 5th floor, it was big enough so that our 37th floor was full of smoke, and not a single fire alarm went off in the entire building! We were lucky enough that one of our colleagues woke up to the smoke. You would expect such an expensive hotel to take care of basic safety systems professionally, but apparently anything goes in this place. I have tried to find out more about the fire in the web, but there seem to be no news about the incident. Hopefully nobody died. Jan 5 2018 	Great price excellent hotel	Checked out the Purple Mountain as a New Year's treat to finish a 10 day budget/backpacker-style China trip. Arrived without reservation and was offered (without negotiation) an exceptional 590 RMB rate for a lovely room on the 38th floor with a great view. The buffet lunch at their restaurant was not comparable to local restaurants as stated in some other reviews - it was FAR superior (and I thought I hated buffets...). Local Chinese food is great, and much cheaper, no question, but this was 5 star food at a 5 star hotel and the price was not high enough to warrant complaint from those of us from North America or Europe. The same quality lunch at home would be at least twice the price. Prices at comparable Shanghai hotels, as well, as stated in other reviews, are NOT lower but rather twice or three times the price. The lowest rate offered by the Hyatt was 2100 RMB. A cheaper 5 star (or if you insist, 4 star, by non-Chinese standards) is IMPOSSIBLE to find for what we paid (the equivalent of US$75). Very highly recommended! Oct 24 2017 	Excellent food	Service was very good but not exceptional with asian standards. Rooms are very clean and well mantained.The food is exceptionally good and will make your stay a pleasure. For one you should try the special noodle dishes prepared on display by a dedicated noodle chef. Meeting facilities exellent. Sep 13 2017 	Fantastic view	We have stayed at the Purple Mountain a couple of times while we were visting China, It is a beautiful hotel with high standards, We had rooms on the 17th floor and 30th floor, a fantastic view from either, Breakfast is very good and caters for Westerners. The hotel is quiet, clean and rooms are fairly large, bathrooms are a good size as well.The restaurant in the hotel was very expensive, there are lot's of good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel and much cheaper.Take the Metro from Dongfang Lu to the Science Museum underground market, pay three yuan one way, Westerners have a &quot;twice the price face&quot; so half whatever they ask for, then half it again as your starting price. May 1 2016	Modern hotel transport links not great	We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of April. The hotel itself is new, high quality, 5 star establishment. Rooms are decorated to a high standard. The breakfast/ lunch buffet is excellent. Note - pool does not open until June &amp; DongFang metro station is closed for about 6 months. This means there is a 15 minute walk from the the nearest metro. You can always take a cab into town but beware it took us 50 minutes to get to the Bund due to traffic at midday. You are better off getting a cab to a metro station.There is also construction on new buildings nearby (we did not notice any noise as the work was just starting)Probably not ideal for tourist until metro is back up and running apart from that would recommend. Mar 15 2016	Exceeded my expectations newly built modern decor	I visited this hotel for the new year's holiday with my boyfriend this january and was delighted to find that this hotel was so modern and well-appointed. It was my first visit to shanghai, so I had no expectations since i did not know anything about the hotel other than the fact that my boyfriend's mother had stayed at the same hotel on a recent trip. Upon entering the huge lobby, I was surprised to find a massively decked out christmas tree with a banner reading, &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot; I didnt think communism and christmas were compatible but, apparently, they are. During check-in, the receptionist was very friendly and quickly upgraded us to an executive room on the highest floor. Upon entering our room, we were impressed by the contemporary dark hard wood floors, modern decor, and immaculate bathroom. The room was smaller than expected and there was no actual wall dividing the bathroom from the bedroom area, just a curtain, which could have been a serious privacy problem for some people, but the bed was very comfortable with a great mattress, super soft sheets, and a plush down comforter. I highly recommend the breakfast buffet (included in our room rate) for their fabulous selection of eastern and western delicacies, but the dinner selections leave much to be desired, are quite expensive, and are better left undiscovered. The staff are very helpful and friendly when approached, but they do not hover, so some may interpret this as disinterest. Overall, the experience was very pleasant, with the exception of a very bizarre incident, in which a foot masseuse, who worked for the hotel, followed us up to our room and barged in because we payed for the massage by charging it to our room rather than paying cash as she preferred. We had to call the concierge to talk to her in order to get her out of our room! Crazy lady! Moral of the story: great hotel, great amenities, just don't get a foot massage. Oct 24 2015 	Comfortable hotel good services	I stayed in Sept. 2015 for business and found the hotel a superb place overall. My room on the 39th floor had a great view. It was nicely furnished and came with a large TV. The bathroom was good size and nicely appointed. The breakfast buffet offered good selections, and the staff was helpful. The &quot;broadband&quot; Internet connection is excruciatingly slow -- like a dial up service in the U.S. The hotel is great for business travelers, but if you are in Shanghai purely as a tourist, you don't need the amenities or pay for the price of Purple Mountain. Aug 9 2015 	good but too expensive in particular services	I am staing in the Purple mountian for a couple of days august 2015. The place is good and offeres all services you´d expect of a 5*. I paid a special rate of 135 USD, which is still a lot for Shanghai standard. You can get a good 4*-place for half that plrice that offers everything needed (gymnn, internet etc. is standard in all 4 * i ve seen up to now). A partcularity is the swimmignpool on the roof of the 5th floor - very nice view.Even worse- everything is very expensive here, laundry is triple price comapred to others (45RMB for a shirt instead of 10/15 in 4* places i staid before), I paid 45 RMB (4.5 Euro) for a very bad expresso, 120 RMB per day for internet (free or cheap in many 4*). Food is OK, but comparable or better Chinese or Japanese food you ll find in the small places that you ll find all over Shanghai(where you can eat for 50-70 yuan a full meal in a nice place, as i did yesterday, even alone withe same improvisation. Quite a few of the upper class restaurants have enlish menues or pictures on the menu ). The only catch is the breakfast ... 4* places often have chinese breakfast only (which is a hot meal of rice and meat and fish, reasonable coffee is available though).So to my conclusion if you have somebody that can help you to get around and order food, or if you like the adventure of ordering food in China... better stay in a 4 *. May 11 2015	Pricey 5*	Stayed at the Purple Mountain on 21 Apr 05 while the Shanghai Auto Show was going on. Due to the auto show most of the hotels in Pudong were fully booked. The Executive room at the Purple Mountain was of 5* quality, but very expensive at 1660rmb plus a 249rmb surcharge. This equates to about $230 for one night, which is over priced. I was also charged 57rmb for internet, which I did not use. Beautiful property, excellent room &amp; above average buffet breakfast. But, too expensive. Apr 17 2015 	Nice Hotel but hard to find info on!	Stayed at Purple Mountain for about 10 days in March 2015 while in Shanghai for a trade show and a little tourist time. Located in Pudong, it was pretty convenient to the New Shanghai Expo Center, about 10 to 30 minutes depending on traffic. This is a huge benefit vs. hotels on the other side of the River in old Shanghai. It is a good location for a business hotel.I didn't find it difficult to get across the river for restaurants, sightseeing, or other activities. Taxis very cheap and prompt. Local shopping, etc. not as good as on other side though.The hotel is very nice. Rated 5 stars by Chinese Tourism and I would classify it as nice as most Hyatt, Westin, Radisson, etc. hotels in most cities. However, not to the scale of 4 Seasons, Grand Hyatt, et. al. Probably not a 5 star hotel though. Rooms dark wood and rich and very nice. Restaurant excellent for breakfast and very good for dinner. Served Western and Asian foods. I did not get to try the Chinese Restaurants in the hotel. There were some excellent Chinese restaurants nearby that worked great for us when we were with our local hosts. The business center was very good. However, in room broadband was very slow. I don't think that was the hotel's fault but do to local internet service. The staff was very friendly and helpful.Lastly, the rate was quite a value compared to most hotels of comparable amenities. I only paid $120 night which I found to be quite a bargain. Aug 21 2021 	Esta muy muy muy lejos de ser un 5 estrellas Aug 3 2021 	?????????????? May 29 2021 	Sehr repräsentatives Hotel Oct 28 2017	cinque stelle a prezzo di quattro"
"Oct 29 2021 	Good Hotel in Great Location In Pu Dong	I stayed at the Radisson Century Park Pu Dong for four nights for business. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and large. The buffet breakfast was good. Staff spoke good English. Free internet and satellite TV with a lot of English channels. At $170.00 USD per night with breakfast a decent value in Shanghai. The hotel is adjacent to a shopping and restaurant area with a Carrefour, many small stores, and numerous restaurants. Malone’s American Café has good western food and the Korean Barbeque place was very good. I would rate this hotel a solid 4 stars in a good location and would stay again. Sep 24 2021 	Business needs fulfill but not really for tourist	I don't think I have to comment much on the room and service.It fulfills my basic needs. As for the breakfast, it is not to my liking at all especially since I had seen them placing some of the breakfast food as early as the night before. However, there is a no of decent restaurants or cafes nearby. Some days I would skip the buffet breakfast and grab a sandwich or scone from the cafe or starbucks. The gym is well equiped. After a day's work, it is nice to go for a good and cheap massage near the hotel.For me. the conciege is helpful and knowledgeable in directing you to the places where you want to go. Location is not a plus for tourist. It costs about minimium 30 yuan to travel to xintiandi, nanjing road or anywhere around the bund if the traffic is smooth and the driver is not taking you for a ride. Especially since not every driver knows this hotel. It is useful to have directions written to you in Chinese and show it to the driver. The subway will be a better and faster choice if you feel like walking. And don't be fooled by the Shanghai map, it looks further than what you think. Overall this hotel is good and affordable. But if you are a tourist and not on a budget, you might consider elsewhere. Aug 31 2021 	Business Hotel with good facilities and ""soft beds""	Our company has company-rate at this hotel. I stayed here in August 2021 for two periods of 2 day's as part of china business trip. I have stayed here more often and am alway's pleased to return back. the loby staff is very helpfull, the beds are &quot;soft&quot;, the internet is free of additional charge and the breakfast-buffet is very good; just the basic minimum needs for a business traveler that are fullfilled by this Hotel. Also outside the hotel to the right side there is very good choise of restaurants, where chinees Queen was my faforit, but also Thai and other eating facilities were present.Transportation from Pudong-airport can be done either by Maglev + taxi or taxi (both way's about RMB 120 and takes about 30-40 minutes. Transportation from hotel into town (puxi-nanjin road west) can be done by taxi direct (RMB 45 day-time) or by taxi&gt;science Center&gt;Metro line2 (RMB 16 (11 + 5); in the night the taxi is about RMB 65.Bee aware up to Expo 2020 the whole city is a big road-construction site resulting in multiple trafic-jams, even late evening and night. If you are frequent visiter of the Puxi side for the evening entertainment, you easy have to count for 30min-45min single drive.Of course this is not to blame to the hotel. Jul 19 2021 	Good Hotel	Good Hotel. Modern Facilities. Easy access if you are to go somewhere in Pudong. Got a Carrefour nearby, and for the Indian traveler, there is an Indian Restaurant just around the corner.. May 16 2021 	Decent business hotel	Due to recent budget restrictions my company decided to narrow down the choices of contract hotels in Shanghai. The Radisson is one of the hotels which made the cut. Rooms are clean and the breakfast is good and internet is free.The hotel tries to be trendy but does not quite get there. Most of the staff are trying to be friendly but is not yet very experienced and often do not know how to handle out of the ordinary requests.They definitely have to upgrade their key card system soon. Everytime you get into the lift you see people failing to use their cards to get to their floors. I had to return to the reception 2 times to finally get a key card which could actually open the door to my room.The Radisson is also a little far out from the business centers in Pudong and Puxi.However price is ok and the basic needs are covered. Feb 25 2021 	Good enough	Had to stay here for business and my trust in my China colleagues was not misplaced. The location is a little off, nowhere near downtown, but it was near the office, and as other reviewers mentioned, have enough restaurants, bars and shops to serve the expatriate and local community here. The overall decor is nice, like a psuedo W, with overpriced Chinese contemporary art all over the hotel.The room is also nice and large enough, and the cream/white walls, decor and furniture still look brand new. The internet is also free , which is great and rare in most other countries.Breakfast was the typical 4-5 star boutique quality and style. But you are better off with the traditional beef noodles across the street. And venture out for lunch and dinner outside too, much more variety out there.It was also March but still freezing at 5 degrees when my colleagues and I were here. My colleague didn't know it was so cold, and the concierge lent him his personal leather jacket when my colleague wanted to go out. wow Sep 11 2018	Good food OK accomodations	Strayed at this property in Sept 2018 as part of a global business meeting held in ShangHai. The food and service were excellent, the buffett for breakfast, lunch and dinner a good mix of western and chinese styles. The room, just so-so. ShangHai is a very humid city (like Miami). The upstairs floors had a distinctive odor, somewhat musty and this carried over to the rooms. Didn't bother me after a couple of days but was strong my first day. The rooms are already starting to show their age / tired decor. The bathroom is nice, but starting to date. The bathroom has a glass wall to the room - hope your spouse doesn't need privacy in the bath or on the john. beds are nice, free wi-fi and internet and decent view over this new area of the city. Great location and nice to have additional dining and entertainment options in the nearby mall. The area is geared towards the expatriate community and the stores / restaurants reflect this (carrefour grocery store, irish pub, etc...) Jun 23 2018 	chid design hotel in Pudong	I stayed here on July 07 for Propak Exhibition and hotel is a very good location for the New Exhibition Center.Rooms are very nice decorated with a touch, large and comfortable, see my pictures where you will see glass wall between bath and bedroom.Location is good for business especially for exhibitions but take care because taxi drivers have problems sometime in getting you there.A plus is the mall and shops connected to the hotel as written in other reviews: many restaurants for dinner options (Japanese, CHinese, Indian, Pizza Hut, Italian...) and good to have there a Carrefour supermarket, a beauty parlor and massage center where for 20 € you can have a 2 hours oil massage.NEGATIVE: gym is lower level than good Radisson hotels and even if it is equipped with latest Technogym treadmills (my opinion best machines for that) something is missing.More negative hotel has no steam bath, pools for cooling down and just a small sauna inside man's bath, no relaxation area after sauna. May 18 2018 	Great Hotel	Radisson in Pudong Shanghai, is a great hotel to stay at for Business travelers, and tourists.It's a short taxi to the subway. Great price for a real modern, clean hotel. Nearby there is Starbucks, Pizza Hut, and great restaurants. I recommend this to anyone who does not want to get ripped off in Shanghai with over priced hotels.The photos online are really the way the hotel looks, no surprises. Its beautiful. Feb 18 2018 	Very Modern Decor	I stayed at the Radisson Pudong on a recommedation from a business colleague. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel decor is very modern. The hallways are very dark. But once you get to the room, it is a different story. The walls are pure white. All of the furniture is white and smooth. The bathroom is small, but it feels more spacious because there is a glass wall where it adjoins the room. It probably sounds creepier than it is. If you are staying in the room with another person, there is a shade that you can put down. I was by myself, so it really didn't matter.There are several restaurants in the hotel. I ate a dinner a couple of times in the restaurant on first floor and had dim sum in the restaurant on third floor. There are also many restaurants and shops in the area next to the hotel. Jan 1 2018 	Designer chic and good all-round service	Stayed here for a week on business. Most of the other reviews have said it all already, but I can confirm their impressions - a chic, designer hotel with good service.Another plus, depending on your point of view, is the location. It's situated close to various restaurants and shops which are in part tailored to the visiting western businessman. There is a big choice of Chinese restaurants with menus in English as well as Chinese, and also restaurants with other cuisines. I would not really recommend the hotel's restaurants - they are vastly overpriced, and in the case of the European-style one, just not good.At the weekend I went to Century Park and watched people flying kites- not a bad way of passing the time if you are jet-lagged and can't be bothered going somewhere in particular. Aug 30 2007 	Excellent	Definitely stay at this hotel again if I go to Shanghai. Loved the modern, chic design. Enjoyed so much that I decided to take the time to write a hotel review first time ever. Previous stays at the likes of Four Seasons, St. Regis, Marriott, etc. in many parts of the world didn't prompt me to.I checked in late in the evening, greeted by polite, professional staff at the reception. They were very apologetic for the 3 minutes I was waiting for another guest checking in. Waiting for 3 mins and staff kept saying &quot;sorry&quot; -- that' pretty rare in the mainland. Then I was offered a free upgrade to a suite. (I booked on the hotel's website as they offered special deal for HK$680/night + 15%.) Room is spacious, clean, white and light tone, design is simple yet elegant, comfortable bed. Very quiet -- extra points given for this because it can be very annoying when you find yourself constantly hearing what people next door is doing, even at high-end luxury hotel. This problem absolutely doesn't exist in the rooms here. One flat panel TV in the living room and another one in the bedroom. There's just one thing I didn't like -- one of the corners of the bathroom walls were part made of glass, which means if you share the room with a friend it's embarrassing. Even after pulling down the curtain they are still not entirely covered. Pretty annoying. Oh well, the bathtub and separate shower and a ceiling decorated with paintings compensated for part of that. There's an iron and iron board in one of the closets for those who care. Shoe shine service means leaving your shoes in the basket inside the closet and the cleaning lady polishes them for you. Not the professional kind of shoe shining service you'd expect from Four Seasons.Windows overlooking mainly newly built apartment buildings, from one side I could see a church, from another side I could see the &quot;Big Thumb Square.&quot;Speaking of the Square -- That's a good reference point when talking to cab drivers. At the square, there are also quite a few restautants -- First you'll see one claim to offer Hong Kong cuisine (didn't try so can't comment whether it's authentic or not);Opposite to it is an Indian one (I did see Indian people eating in there and Indian chefs working inside);Then a couple of Japanese one;Two Korean restuarants;Shanghainese, Northeast Chinese,Hong Kong style seafoodPizza Hut,Another pizza fastfood place,HaagendazStarbucksHong Kong style dessert placeTwo western bakeriesAnd there's Carrefour supermarket (opens until 10 p.m.)There's an open area where locals/tourists hang out until after 10 pm. Nice if you like outdoor cafe as there's one at the center.There are also about four restaurants inside the hotel. I tried the one of 3rd floor serving Cantonese cuisine. Modern design, tasty food, well, not the kind of top-notch Cantonese restaurants where you can find a big variety of delicate dishes, but simple black pepper beef stir fry dish and &quot;special&quot; fried rice do taste good. There's also all-you-can-eat dim sum lunch but didn't try.Breakfast room service -- congee not tasty. There's a cafe that offers sandwiches/pastries/coffee at the hotel. Just turn left after you leave the hotel foyer. Next to it is *MY FAVOURITE* fruit store! Great variety of higher-than-average quality fruits. Not easy to find in the mainland, especially that close to a hotel. Open till 12 midnight. Not the cheapest you can get but it caught my eyes the moment I passed by the hotel for the first time.There are also a hair salon, massage place -- Just turn right after coming out of the hotel, it's a two-minute walk at most. The salon charged 38 yuan for blow dry. They'd ask which type of shampoo you want. I asked what's the difference between the two that they offered and was told one is the regular with no extra charge, another one adds extra moisture and cost 20 yuan more. I chose the latter just to make myself feel &quot;safer&quot; as you really don't know what would be in the &quot;regular&quot; one. There's also a hair salon inside the hotel, but I called to make a reservation in the morning, was told to come after 5 mins. I did. Then the lady there asked me to wait for another 5 mins. I did again. When I returned, she said the stylist is on his way coming from the building at the back (apparently the hotel provides residence for its staff). I didn't want to waste any more time waiting so I left. Still that lady was very polite and kept apologizing. Broadband in the room was complimentary. Had a bit of trouble connecting initially. A manager and a tech staff came up 10 mins after I called for help and fixed it. This review is getting too long so I better round up soon. Just have to say it one more time the staff are highly professional -- One of them spotted my taxi bill when he opened the door for me and asked where I came from. I was puzzled at first but he quickly explained it normally shouldn't cost that much: the meter showed my bill was more than 150 yuan. I told him I went to some very remote places and he was relieved. Can you believe these front door staff can be so attentive and care about their customers? Another staff reminded me to ask the driver for a receipt because if there's anything wrong I can file a compaint. These staff are unbelievable -- SUPER!!OK, I'm calling this place my home in Shanghai. Only thing you need to think about is it's on Pudong side, where the international airport and new business district is. It takes longer to go to Puxi (xi=west, dong=east) where the Bund and XinTianDi are located. Depends on what your priorities are. I stayed at the legendary Peace Hotel, left after one night because it's old and stuffy, stayed at JinMao Grand Hyatt, enjoyed it but the staff are cold and indifferent. Stayed at one of the Jin Jian hotels, cost more than 800 yuan/night but nowhere close to what I get from Radisson Pudong. Good luck! Jun 3 2007 	Quite Nice !	Stayed here for a mini break. Nice hotel, lovely lobby, modern interiors. Rooms were spacious which was great ! Cool design of the Bathroom, where there was a panel of glass from the Bedroom. Service levels good, with most speaking english.Not bad spread for breakfast on the western side. Chinese side not that impressive. It is slightly out from central. Two options, take the metro from Century Park, takes about 10 mins into the Shanghai Telecom Tower. Cab ride to the metro from hotel is about 10 mins.Or take the cab straight to Central i.e. Bund etc. This wil take longer about 20-30 mins depending on the traffic (and driver !!! Yes, they are quite mad out there, like in Formula 1)Overall quite nice !Must try the Massage Salon close to the Hotel. Took my wife and had a great foot massage after a heavy day of sightseeing and very reasonable and open till 1am ! Apr 21 2007	Would definitely stay there again	We stayed at this hotel late Jan/early Feb and found it great. Our flight arrived early but they were very obliging and let us in to the room early. Room and bathroom (separated only by a glass wall) were very spacious, had everything we needed and the beds were very comfortable. The staff were most helpful. My husband was disappointed in the breakfast so thereafter we walked round the corner to a beautiful bakery - too tempting!A quick taxi ride to the metro and then everywhere you wanted to go easily accessible. Do make sure you have the destination written in Chinese for the taxi driver or ask the hotel staff to inform them. Nov 27 2006 	Wonderful Experience	Just came back from a week in this Hotel. I was visiting for a conference that is held every two years. This Hotel has everything the traveller could ask for excellent Internet access in room for free and a great modern Gym for fittness. The staff are warm and welcoming and 95% of them speak excellent English.Large Luxury Rooms. This is the best Hotel experience I have had in 7 years of business travel in China. Highly Recommended. Oct 26 2006 	Radisson Pudong - excellent!	We have just returned from staying at this hotel for a conference and found it an excellent choice. It was new, edgy modern, great service and whilst we didnt use the restaurants the breakfast was also excellent . being on Pudong side of the river was no problem and perhaps even a positve (quiet at night) as it was only a 15min walk to the easiest of metro services that I have ever used or a 10min taxi trip to the CBD Oct 10 2006 	brand new great modern 	Just return the other day, and this hotel needs a good review, since I was very impressed by this hotel! The price-quality ratio is more than perfect, I paid a little over 50 €uro per night for a Deluxe Room (without breakfast), which is excellent deal. The room has eveything which one needs, even broadband internet is included in the room price. The bathroom is bright and modern and the rain shower is an enjoyment itself. The large room is equiped with flat screen TV, so everything realy is top-end! Overall the service throughout the hotel is also fine. The only thing which was annoying was the very loud kitchen fan, so get a table for breakfast away from the open kitchen with the Asian food. For someone who is looking for a modern hotel at a great price, got to the Radisson Hotel in Pudong!"
"Nov 18 2021 	Great place to stay - comfortable rooms tasty food great service!	Some of the best parts of this hotel: the fitness center and spa is well-kept, there are individual televisions for the elliptical machines, and even yoga and judo classes offered. The pool, according to one of my colleagues, was very clean but over-chlorinated.The breakfast buffet is wonderful: you can go Asian, go American, go British, go Japanese... there's everything. Dim sum, omlettes, pancakes, French toast, melon, mangoes, corned beef hash, smoked salmon, salad, banana bread, croissants, cereals, juices.... the list goes on. One warning - there is a smoking section, as there are still plenty of smokers in the world that need to be catered to. The smoke DOES waft over occassionally to the non-smoking section, but hey, nothing's perfect.The rooms are very clean, luxurious bedding (I wanted to take home the pillows!), nice decor, flat screen TVs, transitional/modern fixtures, free wifi... I only gave four stars for the room because one time, I came back to my room, and the gentleman cleaning the room was obviously sick - sniffling and coughing all over the place. Not wanting to get sick during my stay, I was understandably dismayed by the germs he was spreading while cleaning the faucets, counters, etc. I wanted someone to reclean the room after he left!Since cabs are so inexpensive (literally, $3-5 to most places!), the location is fine. Be careful of where your room is, though; since the hotel is at a well-travelled fork of sorts, the traffic horns in the morning can wake you up (if you want to sleep in.)The hotel has a park, along with a convention hall/center and several villas. I went for a jog throughout, and though it was short, it was wonderful to have so much greenery on hand in the middle of a such an industrial and bustling city.I suggest that anyone travelling to this hotel, and to Shanghai in general, take a little pocket Engligh-Chinese dictionary, and maybe even take some Chinese CDs from the library before travelling. English is not spoken widely, so past &quot;hello!&quot; and &quot;thank you!&quot;, a lot of the staff, like approximately 75%, didn't know what I meant when I asked for a pharmacy, a drug store, or place to buy medicine. But charades goes a long way!The concierge desk was come and go; the head concierge is extremely knowledgeable, but the others are iffy. Make sure you have them write down on a card where you intend to go in Chinese, so you can show this card to the taxi driver.Bon voyage! Aug 22 2021 	Hotel Agreable	In a nace garden place, this hotel will be very nice for any kind of stay. Do no hesitate to go there ...My critc might be hard, but it is suppose to be a high class hotel ... Jul 15 2021	Superb setting	We enjoyed our four-night stay here in 2018. The park surrounding the hotel is ideal for a before-breakfast or after-dinner stroll. The hotel itself is excellent - try the Chinese restaurant. May 28 2021 	Great hotel shame about the location	Spent two nights at this hotel during a business trip. If it weren't for the location, there would be absolutely nothing to complain about. The rooms are clean, pretty big and offer everything you need. Bathrooms are also clean, large and there's a good selection of different toiletries. And there's free internet in the rooms, tea making facilities&lt; complimentery mineral water, well-stocked mini-bar, etc. - everything you'd expect.The breakfast buffet offers a lot of options, both asian and western fare. And you should try the dinner buffet - there aren't that many options, but if you like sea food you'll love it. I also oredered food from room service and it was hit-and-miss - great soup, but dissapointing noodles - but the prices were pretty modarate for this class of hotel.The receprion staff was very helpful, they wrote down the places I needed to go in chinese, so that I wouldn't have any problems with taxi drivers.The only downside is the location - yeah, the park setting is great, but if you want to do any sightseeing all the main attractions are pretty far and you have to take a taxi. Feb 19 2021 	mediocre	The location is great for walking in the residential former French Concession, and the green park surrounding it is nice... but for international hotel rates you get very limited Chinese service... poor English from operators and front desk people... very mediocre but expensive Western food from room service, and tired room decor. Free internet was VERY slow, and kept cutting out. Everything was beige. Feb 3 2021 	Very nice hotel in the French Concessions	This is a very nice hotel, located in the French Concession, our favorite part of Shanghai. We have stayed at this hotel many times and can particularly recommend the club floor, where the before dinner drinks and snacks are really good.It is a quite hotel situated in a small park, so ask for park veiw to secure some green scenery from your window. The low rise quarters surrounding the hotel have nice restaurants and cafees and makes the ground for some good walks.It is a 4 star hotel, a little flossy in the corners, but nice and clean rooms and an excellent breakfast buffet. So with respect to price, this is a top level experience. Dec 6 2018 	Good not the best location	This is a newer hotel with very comfortable rooms. I have only had breakfast in the dining areas, which was included in the room rate and also very good. This hotel sits on what I think was once a government compound and the grounds are large and very well maintained. It is relaxing to walk the grounds after a days work. There are no restaurants close by but a short taxi ride gets me to Heng Shan Lu and a lot of western restaurants and bars. My favorite is Omally's which some say has the best burger in Shanghai. For me this is a good choice for a hotel, but there are so many to choose from and at many different prices from very high to reasonable. Sep 19 2018 	All in all a 4 star experience but could improve...	The hotel has great rooms in a nice quiet setting. The restaurants were lacking however and the executive lounge was a smoke fest at night. The hotel had the best workout room I have experienced in Shanghai and yes I have stayed at the Shangri-La :). It is close to Xintiandi and about 20 minutes from the Bund. I will stay there again, but make sure to note restaurants in the area. Simply Thai was one good lunch option and I am found of New Heights on the bund. Sep 6 2018 	A Good Hotel	We stayed at the Radisson Xing Guo in late August . Our family of five includes children aged 15, 13 and 9. My sister in law was also with us. We found the location to be quite acceptable. The walk for us to the subway took about 15 minutes. And subway line 2 took us very quickly to most tourist attractions. The hotel has a nice pool. Food was fine. We purchased air tickets through the business office at a rate that seemed to match that offered on ctrip so I doubt we paid too much of a fee. In fact the hotel left an envelope with some cash in it in our room when the air tickets ended up costing less than the agreed upon price.Our reservations did not include free breakfast on the last day. But the hotel waived the charge even though we argued with them that we should be paying.Our only very minor complaint was that the concierge was not aware that the Museum of Science and Technology was closed (Monday) the day we asked him about going there. This may be unfair as it was primarily our responsibility to check this out.All in all, a very nice stay. Aug 9 2018	Nice Room and Pleasant Stay	We stayed at the Radisson Shanghai Xing Guo Hotel as part of a group tour package that included visits to Beijing, Xian, Shanghai and Hong Kong. The Radisson is a very pleasant hotel near the area of Shanghai known as the French Concession (or French Quarter). The hotel is modern and nicely appointed, but a bit far from a subway stop and the center of the tourist action in Shanghai. Since we were part of a group tour, the distance was not a problem since we did not have any free time to taxi into the central city area anyway. Had we free time in the evenings, then we would have had to catch a taxi since subway stations were about a 30 minute walk away from the hotel (nearest stations: Line 2 Jiangsu Lu or Line 1 Heng Shan Lu). The shops and restaurants of the French Concession might have been an evening diversion we could have considered, but our tour itinerary did not allow for much exploration and therefore we did not attempt to walk it from the hotel. The hotel is set in a cluster of old colonial style villas and a park, in keeping with the area's French colonial history. It would have been nice to walk the grounds, but time did not permit. Staff were very professional and willing to help. Our room was nicely appointed and very comfortable for 2 persons. It probably had every amenity I would have wanted and a lot of work went into the details to fit out the room for the guests. Our bathroom was ample and nicely appointed as well with a ton of marble and mirrors to make one feel like one of those new Shanghai millionaires. Our package included daily buffet breakfast and this was excellent. As in most hotels in China, the offerings included a wide selection of both western and asian breakfast dishes in a sunny and beautifully appointed dining room. The Radisson offered a large indoor swimming pool, huge work out area, and even a 6 lane bowling alley. This is a hotel that is good for business travellers who don't mind taking taxis and for families who would stay put on the property to enjoy the onsite amenities offered. If I return to Shanghai on my own, then I would likely book at a hotel closer to People's Square, the Bund, or possibly near a subway stop in order to access the restaurants, shopping and night life that Shanghai is famous for. The Radisson would be a bit out of the way to access these things via subway. May 23 2018 	A tad far but nice rooms	The hotel is a bit far from the city centre and the main cluster of the big name hotels. Most taxi drivers don't know this hotel so remember the address and preferably the road junction in Mandarin. The main entrance of the hotel is located inside the park/grass area, so you will have to direct the taxi driver around the bends until you find the lobby.The rooms are reasonable size with a comfortable king size bed. The room and bathroom are clean (I'm quite picky about cleanliness!). They gave the usual cable channels on TV and free bottles of water in the room which is replenished each day.The breakfast is very standard hotel breakfast, there is a good selection of food, but not very tasty. At least they have a chef standing by to cook your eggs how/when you want them. The staffs are not particularly helpful, but will answer your questions/help you make a reservation at a restaurant if you ask. But don't expect them to help you plan your day or have in depth knowledge of the city.If I went back to Shanghai again, probably won't stay here because it's a bit out of the way and it's a hassle to take the taxi every time you want to go out. The taxis are cheap (meter starts at RMB 11 and takes forever for the meter to jump compared to other Asian city taxis), but sometimes there is heavy traffic jams and the cars just DON'T move!! But the hotel is nice and located in the French Concession area which is very tranquil and quite a lovely area of Shanghai. Nov 11 2007 	Great Hotel! Would go back again!!!	We visited Shanghai on business and I was given the responsibility of planning our whole trip. Considering I am not well travelled and knowing that we were going to be in China for two whole weeks, I knew that comfort and security were important. To be honest, I made reservations at the Radisson Plaza Xing Guo based off of price. I knew it was a little further from downtown but since we were in China for business and not pleasure, that was not of real importance to us. Hotels that are downtown near the Bund or along the banks of the Huangpu tend to be in the $250 - $350 USD range which I thought was ridiculous!!! We were a short 10-15 minute car ride away from the downtown core. The hotel overall was very lovely. An impressive foyer, attentive staff etc. We arrived the day Typhoon Wipha hit Shanghai so our original room reservation was impacted by this since the person who had the room the night before chose to stay an extra few nights to wait out the storm. Lucky for us - we were upgraded to the suites which were really breathtaking! HUGE room, HUGE bathroom, HUGE bed! The bathroom in my room was really spectacular. Marble, gold, granite, tub, shower etc etc. The room was clean, bright, relaxing etc. Bottled water is complimentary in the room. We only ate breakfast at the hotel which was really quite lovely. The restaurant staff were also very attentive and were quick to remove dishes once we were done with them. Our driver and translator were quick to inform us that we had picked an interesting hotel since this hotel is more apt to have foreign diplomats and government officials than foreign business people at their hotel. From what we saw of the grounds, they were really lovely. If it wasn't typhoon weather for the 3 days we were there, we would have walked around the grounds and explored the gorgeously manicured gardens they had as well. Only minor complaint was when we arrived for check in it took a little prodding to get us the upgrade. After being on an airplane for 16 hours and sitting in Shanghai traffic for another hour plus, we did not have the energy to battle with the front desk staff. Lucky for us, the translator we hired saved the day and pushed to get us to our rooms for a brief rest before dinner. All in all, best bang for your buck near downtown Shanghai. Oct 30 2007 	Nice location	This hotel is in a nice quiet location in Shanghai in a rather attractive part of town. The grounds are expansive but they are dotted with buildings and dont really qualify as a 'garden'. The rooms are neat and adequately equipped. The level of service depends upon the member of the staff you draw. I have had service that was really excellent especially in the Li Palace resturant, to the indifferent - particularly at the front desk. Be warned that not all of the staff speak english and this can be quite trying.The food in the Li Palace is fabulous and the staff are very helpful. The buffet breakfast provides a huge variety and you can have a satisfying meal though not all of the food on offer is made well. Aug 6 2007 	nice hotel	Very nice hotel, very confortable, very nice pool area.We had reserved by internet and PREPAID the room. But we arrived at the hotel at 10:30 pm and our room was no more available. So they put us in the suite for the first night and we had to change rooms for the rest of our stay !!Internet is 20 dollars per hour !!The hotel is noisy (street noise) and not in the center but the staff is very good and pleasant, the rooms very confortable and the pool is great. So it was a good stay. Apr 19 2007 	Business stay	Stayed for a business meeting. Rooms are nice - stayed in the &quot;Jr. Suite&quot; with Plaza Club use ( as an executive club, it is pretty plain but the service is good. The standard guest room, while nice, was small, but clean. Jr. Suite room about equal to the Shang. I would stay here again. The service crew for our business meeting was excellent. Food at hotel was excellent as well. Jul 28 2006 	Great hotel in Shanghai	We stayed at this property for 3 nights in July 2006 with our 3 and 5 year old daughters. The bathroom was large and very clean with a huge tub. We had two beds that were very comfortable. The TV got many foreign channels. Here are a couple of points:1) the hotel has a great pool and gym. I got a massage there that was ok, not great. The floor near the pool is very slippery, so be careful. The pool is very clean and was great to spend time at. There is also a deck off the exerce room. 2) location. It was 100 degress plus when we were in Shanghai, so we didn't explore the surrounding area very much on foot. We didn't go to any of the shopping centers either, but there are stores in the area if you are willing to take a cab.3) staff: The level of English is pretty good.4) food: very good. the breakfast buffet is great and you can always get diet coke with ice :) We ate at the hotel 3 nights for dinner and the food was excellent and we are very picky. Not too pricy either.We really liked this hotel and highly recommend it. Jun 27 2006	A Lovely Boutique Hotel	I did an extensive research and picked Radisson Plaza as our hotel in Shanghai as the 15-acre garden may serve the playground for our young kids. As a matter of fact, the garden not only provides a great view for the rooms in the front, but also filters out the noises inherent in this over populated city. The service was friendly, yet could be more energetic. The breakfast is a great combination of Western and Chinese food, providing our kids a jump start daily. I just wish the rooms could be as spacious as the bathrooms. Jun 11 2006	The Best Hotel	I have stayed in many luxury properties, but this hotel is the best. Prepare to be pampered in 5 start luxury. Location is also very conveniant. Apr 18 2006	LOVED IT!	We stayed three nights in april. We are so happy we chose this hotel. In the begining we tried to go to the Westin as there was an internet offer and we tought location was better but could not do it because of some problems with the credit car. This hotel is excellent and, contrary to what we thought, location is not a problem as you anyway have to take a taxi everywhere in Shanghai and they are very cheap. There are excellent restaurants around. Hotel staff were excellent and always treated us great and give us very good advice. We made the reservation through Raddisson web site and breakfast was included. Breakfast was very good. The hotel was very nice, it did not seem crowded. Jul 14 2005	A treat!	Travelling as a single mom with children is not always easy. At most more exclusive hotels, you will not be treated with respect. Unfortunately. Radisson Plaza Xing Guo is an exception. The location might not be the very best, although there are some very good restaurants and great shopping close by. But everything else is almost perfect. Food is fantastic, especially the Sunday Champagne Brunch. Breakfast buffet is very good. Staff is very helpful and service-minded. Pool and gym are of the highest standards and rooms are spacious and comfortable. But best of all: it is one of the rather few hotels with a high standard where they treat people equally! And make you feel genuinely welcome, even if you happen to be a single mom! May 22 2005	What a nice surprise!	We just returned from a 14 day China tour and the best hotel was the Radisson Plaza Shanghai! The hotel is located in the beautiful Frenchtown section of Shanghai. Although you need to take a cab to most restaurants or shopping districts, the cost will be minimal. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and the buffet breakfast was the best with many choices Asian and Western style.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely return to this property!! Apr 2 2005 	Best kept secret in Shanghai	This hotel is great, in a very cool, quiet, gardenesque setting for urban Shanghai. The hotel is in, or on the border of, the French Concession. It's not the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, but its much better than the Hilton or Regal... and if you plan to be in Puxi and not Pudong, it is much better located than the Grand Hyatt or Shangri-la. I stay here all the time, as I am in Shanghai quite a bit, and we have a corp rate with the hotel. Do not be put off the by the fact that it is a Radisson! I usually prefer Four Seasons, Ritz, Mandarin Oriental class hotels, but since I spend so much time in Shanghai, i can't be dropping $300 a night 15 nights a month. This place really is a hidden gem in Shanghai and is quite good value. May 24 2021	???????????????????????????"
"Japan-China youth friendship tour!	i went to Shanghai and stayed at this rainbow hotel, and i think it was pretty good, compared to the other hotels in China. This hotel provides English staffs(some even speak Japanese) so we had no problem staying here. Theres also a Japanese supermarket nearby. Jun 4 2021 	Basics Hotel	I was visiting Shanghai to take part in the exhibition and chose this Hotel as it was close to the exhibition venue. Its an economical hotel fairly popular with business travellers. Don't expect too much luxury but you'd get the basics at an economical rate. Sad part is Internet not being free which is a must for a business traveller. Though you can use the business centre services for free. A big plus point is a commercial gym and swimming pool which you can use for free. Jan 16 2021 	My Shanghai Home	I have stayed at the Rainbow 6 or 7 times now, and I keep coming back, so they must be doing something right.Rooms are always nice and big, very clean with everything you need. Only annoying thing (but I think this is in Chinese hotels generally), never have an iron in the room, but to be fair always bring one quickly.For a Shanghai hotel of this class not too expensive, I pay around RMB 575 for a deluxe double. However, that's where the value stops. Food, and particularly drink, is very expensive. I had a 1 litre bottle of water and got stung for GBP 7.00. A small glass of red was the same. Bar menu is pretty bland, which I find amazing in a country with the cuisine of China. Although there is a dumpy little restaurant opposite where the taxis park, and the food here is superb, and dirt cheap. Most staff are pretty helpful, but generally never smile, so that does put a bit of a downer on things.Having said all of this, for me it is my Shanghai home. It is convenient, clean, good facilities and does not break the bank, unless you spend all your time in the bar. I have never had any real problems here, and you only need to ask for anything and it is sorted.Would certainly recommend it, and I will continue to use it as I have done on my last few trips. Jun 10 2017 	Rainbow was just ok...	After travelling first to Beijing and having a terrific experience, I had high expectations for the Rainbow in Shanghai. Apparently this was at one time one of the finer hotels in the Honqiao area. I must say I was a little disappointed. Here is a list of the good and bad of our 5 night stay:The Good:-Rooms were clean-Washrooms were clean and well kept-Walking distance to INTEX (Exhibition Centre)-Beautiful lobby with a great Tailor shop (Mr. Tong)The Bad:-Poor room service (bad menu and the supposed hot food was cold)-Exterior is poorly maintained including the fountain-A MOUSE ran through the Lotus Pavilion Restaurant while we were eating dinner-VERY BAD and expensive in-room internet connection (UP to 90 RMB/day)-Unfriendly staff and not very helpful-Shower ran out of hot water several times-AC BARELY worked. We cooled down in the lobby before going to our roomIn all I guess this hotel is not really geared toward westerners. I have stayed in worse places but I would not stay here again. The Galaxy next door or the Mayfield are better options in this area. Or spend the extra dollars and stay at the Hilton or Sheraton. Jul 21 2016	Good hotel at a great price	Stayed at the Rainbow Hotel for 1 night. Good size rooms and good service. Excellent value for money as I got deluxe room for CNY750. Only drawback is a bit far from Bund but taxis are very very cheap so you are never more than 15 minutes away from anywhere. Nov 16 2021 	??????????? Nov 7 2021 	????????????????????? Aug 26 2021 	????????????? Mar 24 2021 	??????? Mar 11 2021 	????? Mar 4 2021 	?????? Oct 25 2018	???????? Oct 14 2018 	???? May 1 2018 	Schlechteste Hotel in 5 Jahren"
"Great weekend!	We spent a delightful time in the Presidential Suite and I recommend this hotel highly as the service is excellent and the General Manager and his lovely wife are very charming hosts! Nov 15 2021 	Superb Hotel	We never expected Ramada to be so luxurious. We were ther 3 nights for business and were very impressed.The staff was amazing friendly and helpful, i had never seen such an extended breakfast. The Hotel is not the most modern hotel I have seen but they make up for it with their friendly staff and services. The room is very comfortable, big TV with CNN, HBO, AXn and other western movie channels and what I always find important is a spacious and clean bathroom.If you want to stay in Pudong the hotel is definitely worth the room rate. Nov 1 2021 	An example of excellence!!	L.s.I travelled with a partner / colleague of mine to Hong Kong and later to Shanghai and we were both surprisingly treated with one of the best hotel services we experienced since a long time in the Ramada Plaza Pudong. The hotel staff went all the way in their efforts to make our stay a pleasant and comfortable one. Their attention to detail was extreme and we can only recommend this hotel to everyone visiting this region of China, as a business visitor or as a tourist. Thank you ‘Ramada Plaza Pudong Shanghai. Sep 21 2021 	Smelly rooms noisy elevators got back home sick...	Typical Chinese business hotel, but business only. Room was smelly, no decent western television, elevators were very noisy and on my way back home I already had to take some asperine in the plane because of having become sick. Staff are ok, but nothing more than that. Food was good, but hey - where isn't food good in China? The location is ok, but if you pay just a little bit more a stay at the Pudong Renaissance a bit down the road is well worth the extra RMBs! Sep 16 2021 	everything I expected	This was my first stay in the Ramada Plaza Pudong. It is everything you expect as a business traveller. Reasonable close to the ariport, good, clean rooms, enough fitness/relax possibilities, friendly people.. Price/quality is also ok. I will certainly return.Jan Verschroeven, Maasmechelen, Belgium Sep 7 2021 	not worth the room rate	We were there last week for business and we stayed Monday-Friday, prime reason we picked this hotel was because it was near to our customer's factory, and it was the only reason that kept us there, By Friday afternoon we couldn't wait to get out quick enough... the place was dated and furnitures old and tired, the bed was so hard we had back pain after the first night, the water that came out of the bathroom tap had an awful odor, and for me what was unforgivable was that they had no hot water - imagine a luke warm bath or shower after a long hard working day... We will not return there again next time we visit our customer, we could have paid cheaper to stay elsewhere. Staff attitude was OK, but couldn't make up for the unpleasant stay. Jul 27 2021 	Catch the pulse of Shanghai	If u wana be in the city centre, in sync with the beat..this is a nice place to stay, just dont go there looking for tranquility. Jun 15 2021 	Stay here if location is right for your business seek alternate location for pleasure	I stayed here for 4 nights with my wife in May. She was traveling for business while I went along with her for pleasure. We extended her business trip into a vacation to Vietnam. This hotel was recommended by her employer's Shanghai office since it was across the street. I would recommend this hotel for business but not for pleasure. We were put on the executive floor with an &quot;executive lounge&quot; serving overpriced beverages and snacks. For my pleasure side of life, I had to take a cab to get to the subway so that I could then get around the city to more interesting places. The life around this hotel feels oddly suburban, as it is surrounded by a western type business park full of western companies, apartment towers. If you stay here and your company is not paying, buy your water and beer at the Family Mart down the street where it costs 10% of what it does in the hotel.This hotel location does have a few western places to eat nearby, but there are some more interesting places in Shanghai. We actually stayed 1 additional night in Shanghai during a 22 hour layover at the end of our trip. This time we stayed at the Pudong Courtyard Marriott and it was a much nicer room, slightly more interesting street life, and for a comparable weekday rate, it was 20-30% less money this this Ramada. Jun 10 2021 	END OF THE TRIP	this hotel is really very good with a lot of comfort.It was the end of my trip in China and I was pleased by the quality of the room .There is a very good shop for the last shopping Jun 9 2021 	Great hotels especially for long stay guests	This hotel is located outside the busy, crowded and noisy downtown area. Located in JinQiao an more expat area with lots of restaurants (I counted 40 within 1 mile from the hotel). The area is nice, green and quiet, so more or less the opposite of downtown. Still downtown is not far away, by taxi 10km or go to Science &amp; Technology (/ FakeMarket) (±6km) and take the Subway from there.The restaurants of the hotel (1 chinese 1 large 2 openkitchen (Western / Italian &amp; Japanese Restaurant) are great and the breakfast is huge. For breakfast you have a choice between a large western variety or a large asian variety, both are great. Staff is really polite and helpful.The hotel also offers a lot of meeting / business rooms and because it's located in the New Import &amp; Export Business Center, ideal for long stay guests.I would deffinetly recomment this to my friends !! Apr 26 2021 	Excellent Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for my business travel to China. Our office is nearer, which is main advantage to select this hotel. This is also not so far from airport (may be 30-45 minutes).Rooms are great and views from the room are also wonderful. Food is good, and services are better. It has nearby an Indian restaurant which solves problem for vegetarian guys like me.Per night it costs about 1000 RMB. Aug 25 2017 	Your basic business hotel	The hotel provides basic traveler services. The breakfast is actually quite good (and came free with my room). There is a basic gym and decent pool. The staff are reasonably helpful. Unlike others, I don't seem to have had a communication problem.The internet service also came free with my room; however, it was a bit unreliable.The rooms are large and clean &amp; the bed is comfortable (maybe a bit too comfortable!).The biggest down-side for this hotel is that to get to Shanghai you need to take a 20RMB taxi ride of 15-20 minutes--just to get to the metro. If you want a taxi into the PuXi section of Shanghai (where all the tourist stuff is), it takes longer and costs much more. I typically did the metro thing as the metro is fast, clean, safe, and doesn't ask me if I want a &quot;massagee&quot;. Aug 6 2017 	Value for money questionable	Stayed here for 5 nights whilst on business in Shanghai. Booked into the executive floor &amp; used the Upper Deck Lounge for checking in &amp; out.Upper Deck Lounge totally lacked atmosphere &amp; was very basic. Girls on the desk were pleasant, but not all had great english, causing a level of confusion.Efficient service in the bars, but again both bars seemed to lack atmosphere. The main one appeared to be used just prior to guests heading out for the evening or for a night cap.My bedroom was very spacious, clean &amp; comfortable. No complaints at all in this area. High speed internet access also available in the room.Ate breakfast in the main buffet restaurant daily &amp; found the choice &amp; quality to be very good. Ate lunch there one day too &amp; found the choice and quality to be excellent!Location of the Hotel is fine. Walked to a couple of restaurants from there, which took about 15/20 mins. More on offer further a-field, but those trips would require taxis. Jan 9 2017 	Distant from city in Pudong area but comfortable expat community area	Stayed here on business trip for 6 months, with my small family of 2. The establishment offers service apartments (back of building) and hotel rooms (front).Check-in was a breeze, some of the front desk staff are good english speaking, while others are a challenge. We stayed in few units throughtout, varying in layout and size. But overall, the size is good enough for a small family starting from 60 sq/m price around USD2000 per month. Kitchen is open concept for 1 or 2 bedroom units. Broadband is free (generally free and easily available in China) and everything else is complete and clean.From the airport, this is about 30 mins drive, as both are in the same new territory of Shanghai ie. Pudong. The city is another 30 mins or so, in the older territory ie. Puxi. There is no train station nearby ie. closest would be at science center about 10 mins drive.Surrounding area is basically an expat community. Mostly are people who wants to escape from the old bustling traffic congestion of Puxi or are working in the new territory (down the road 15 mins walk, there are many factories and industrial parks) or have children studying nearby (plenty of private schools). A walk of 15 mins (opposite end of industrial parks) would reach a shopping center with Carrefour, hair salons, fast foods, food courts, specialty grocery store, spa, fitness club, huge sports shopping franchise (Decathlon), hardware megastore, more more pub/restaurants (japanese, american, italian, vietnamese, of course chinese, etc.). Amenities are aplenty. The weekends would have families hanging out in this very area, next to a park, while sipping Starbucks coffee and dogs running around, football games, rolling on the grass, etc..... bazaars and fairs going on.If tired of nearby surroundings, a short cab ride around Pudong would take no longer than 15 mins to reach huge Pudong parks and other shopping areas (Thumb plaza) or Times Square Pudong or Pearl Tower, etc..In short, this area is superb for families. But for young couples looking for action, better to look somewhere in Puxi. Oct 24 2004	nice but far from downtown	I accompanied my husband to Shanghai on business. While he worked, I spent my days shopping, sightseeing and spa-ing. This is a very nice hotel - good service, good food, clean and comfortable rooms. It is perfect for the business traveller, but quite a trek for a vacationer to commute to the other side of the river where almost all good shopping and sightseeing is located. Your best bet is to take a taxi to the nearest subway station (costs under 20 RMB in August 2004) then take the subway across the river - much faster than by taxi the whole way because traffic is almost always busy in Shanghai. Nov 6 2021	Ramada plaza: een unieke ervaring Jan 8 2008	Perfetto prima di partire"
"Nov 2 2021 	Good place for an overnight airport stay	I stayed here for a single night, after arriving from a long flight from Newark, and before traveling on to Nanjing, China. The Ramada was easy to get to, with convenient free shuttle service to and from the airport. The room was large and clean, with a nice enclosed balcony area. I had a reasonably priced Chinese dinner in one of the hotel restaurants, the Brasserie, and had a good night's rest with almost no airplane noise.My journey the next morning to Nanjing was quite interesting, as I took the Maglev train into the city, then two subway rides to the Main Rail station, where I was able to catch one of EIGHTY bullet trains which run between Shanghai and Nanjing EACH DAY. Crowding on the subway was quite excessive, even on a Saturday morning. Pollution was not bad in Shanghai, but terrible in Nanjing. People everywhere were quite friendly...not a trace of anti-American feeling.I would gladly stay at the Ramada Pudong Hotel on a future trip. Oct 18 2021 	good hotel	Good standard, good western options on beer and foodas with all hotels in china, restaurant service is hopeless.. but you get used to it. best of the bunch.... Jun 15 2021 	Okay for one night before flying	The Ramada hotel at Pudong airport is your average airport hotel and fine for a nights stay before flying out. Rooms are ok with everything you need but the bathrooms werea little cramped. All services were fine and i would use the hotel again if flying out of Shanghai Pudong. Free shuttle bus to and from the airport Apr 1 2021 	Good Hotel	I stayed in this property for two weeks and was a bit concerned when I read the prior reviews from other fellow trip advisors. The hotel was booked by my work so I really did not have a choice. The room I stayed in was clean and room service was very good. I worked long hours during my stay and the house keeping would always leave a small snickers bar on my bed when I return at night. I thought that was quite nice.The staff at check in was efficient but I have to say their concierge was very average. I called them late at night once to organise a wake up call for the next morning as I had meetings to attend to. I never got my wake up call. When I questioned them they brushed me off and no one seemed to want to take responsibility. My room package also came with complimentary buffet breakfast every morning. The breakfast was crap. Everyday was the same food and the quality was very average. The location of the airport is good if you want a hotel to stay overnight. But its not very centralised. But you can always catch the hotel shuttle bus to the airport and connect to the Maglev to the Long Yang station and then transfer to the metroline if you want to go to Puxi.Finally, one thing I didn't like about this hotel was they only offered free wireless in the lobby. When I stayed at the Ramada in Doha they provided free wireless in the rooms. I thought being a Ramada brand all the hotels will have the same service.Overall a great hotel if you have to overnight in Shanghai and catch a plane the next morning. I would not recommend this hotel if you have business in Puxi or Pudong. They are far better located hotels over in the Pudong and Puxi city centre. Sep 15 2018 	Pathetic service	We have never in our life experienced such bad service. Rude and completely unwilling to help!!! Sep 1 2018	Convenient airport hotel	I stayed at the Putong Ramada last week when I arrived at Shanghai late at night. The hotel is literally next to the aiport, so it's very convenient if you flew in late or you're here for a stopover. Even though it's right by the airport, I barely heard any plane noise.The rooms are adequate for a one night stay. I had the late night snack at the hotel restaurant. It included fresh fruit and a bowl of wonton soup. The wonton soup was ok, but the shrimp in the soup didn't taste fresh, so I didn't eat them.I would recommend this hotel if you just need somewhere to sleep for one night near the airport. Jul 17 2018 	convenient for stopover	The hotel is next to Shanghai airport. There is a hotel shuttle bus at the terminal exit and the journey will take you less than 5 minutes. Check in is fast, staff helpful, English is OK. Room and toilet are clean. Even though hotel is next to airport it is quiet. Shanghai is more than 1 hour by taxi or bus, best if you can take the 400 plus km/hr Maglev train. It will reach Shanghai in minutes. The hotel shuttle can talk you back to the airport, then its a short walk to the Maglev station. May 27 2018 	Old tired and noisy	Stayed here one night before flying out of PVG the next day. On arrival at the hotel the staff stood about for 5 minutes looking at us and our luggage before our interpreter shouted at them to get a porter - the first time that had happened in China so far.Rooms are old fashioned with old TV and small bathroom with no separate shower. Considering how new the airport looks, this hotel looks like it was here a good 20 years before the airport was built.Internet is available for 2 RMB per minute with a max charge per 24 hours of 100 RMB.Don't believe the website when it says that the rooms are soundproofed, I heard every takeoff and landing overnight.I'm sure the other airport hotels are worse, this is China, after all, but the Ramada group should be ashamed of themselves. Apr 21 2018 	sleep on the street rather than here	Okay nobody is at their best at 2 am but that's the deal on the night desk. We arrived into Pudong from Sanya and had just ten hours before our outward flight. The woman at the desk at the Ramada was possibly the rudest person I've ever come across in the 'service' industry - after our taxi driver from the airport. We'd been in China for three weeks already and had loved it - same as anywhere, some great bits some crap - but avoid the Ramada if you can help it. And if you must stay there, don't open the wine -it's awful, corked and they'll try to make you pay. And go to plumbing school before you stay there. Cisterns are a disaster. Horrible end to a great trip. Mar 8 2018 	Convenient hotel for a stop-over in Shanghai	Ramada Pudong Airport Hotel (executive room)-efficient executive check-in is on the 7th floor with breakfast served from 6am. Hotel is a 5 minute shuttle bus ride from the airport terminal. Hotel shuttle is parked at bay #9 or #10 with a 30 minute frequency. The bay was not clearly marked and is located between the airport terminal and car park. Room is clean and has a small bathroom relative to the suite. Room amenities include a microwave, small refrigerator and LAN internet access. 40 minute taxi ride to Xin Tian Di is 140 to 150Y. Be aware that taxi fares increases after 10:30pm.This trip was part of our Tibet/Nepal trip. The Tibet itinerary was booked with Access Tibet Tour agency (highly recommended). Communications with ATT (Brian Yang) were timely and the trip went according to the itinerary. Jan 4 2018 	Great for a stop-over	Stayed at this hotel whilst stopping-over in Shanghai and found the free airport pick-up / drop-off to be quick and convenient.The hotel itself was well presented with good service and facilities. The Brasserie restaurants buffet menus provided a wide range of dishes, with unlimited supplies. Whilst the Chinese restaurant provided authentic dishes at a reasonable price.Our standard double room was clean, tidy and comfortable, and had a good shower for blasting off the jet-lag.Using the free airport shuttle bus in combination with the Maglev train provided a convenient means for getting in to the city centre. After exploring Shanghai's hectic streets, it was nice to head back out to the relative tranquility of the airport.Overall - a good hotel for Shanghai stop-overs. Oct 23 2017 	Beware of a few things	Airport hotels should be flexible with their check in times due to the very different arrival times of their guests. I heard that this property are really bad at this so emailed them the night before to say I would be in at 0800. I got to them at 0800 and no room was available. They told me I would have to wait almost 2 hours to get a room. NO WAY! I was tired and needed sleep so badly it was not funny. I spoke to the Duty Manager who sent me off to the cafe while the room was cleaned. Over an hour later I was in my room. Bad start! The room was ok actually - has a weird balcony which is enclosed. Then again, probably sensible with the toxic air around here. The rooms are quite comfortable and very well cleaned. Housekeepers do the best job in the entire property. The telephone staff leave a lot to be desired. Room service guy takes for ever to deal with and their room service menu is quite limited. I am not a fan of the food here despite being an adventurous eater. Regardless, prices are good I guess. I am here on business so would never choose to come back. Mar 17 2017 	Very good	Very pleasant stay at this hotel. Excellent for the airport - only 5 minutes by shuttle bus and also takes you to the Maglev station (in the airport) which then takes only 8 minutes to get to the new exhibition area. Food in the restaurant was good although the breakfast buffet could have been a bit hotter. Overall a good experience and would stay again. Sep 18 2006 	Dated tired hotel with building works	We only stayed here overnight before our flight back to the uk. From the reviews i was expecting a nice relaxing room. However when we arrived i noticed building works. Half the hotel was being refurbished, there was no mention of this when i booked through the website. We went to check in. I had requested a double room ,now beware a double room in China means a twin room. So thats what we got. I went down to complain but they said they upgraded us to an deluxe room and as half the building was out they only had twin rooms available. Well the room wasn't very nice at all, i dread to think what a standard room was like. It was dated, not very clean and the beds were hard as nails. Needless to say we didn't sleep a wink. It looks like they are updating all the hotel rooms, i would not recommend a stay in this hotel until this has been completed.Unfortunately this is the only hotel 2 mins from the airport and is just about bearable if you are only staying for an overnight stay. May 29 2006	Ideal stop over hotel.	Ideal for a stop over for connecting flights the next day. It was a right decision to stay over and get rested after a long overseas flight rather than making a conncection at the Hongqiao airport which is almost an hour away in the evening . The hotel shuttle bus pick up location is across from Exit 9 / 10 with the hotel name clearly marked on a concrete piller above the eye level. It is a smaller size (Perhaps 16 passangers) bus and it runs every 30 minutes which starts very early in the morning. The bus is also clearly marked with the hotel name. Be careful when loading as the bus was loading on the traffic side of the lane and we have also observed airport maintenance vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. When we arrived at the arrival level , there is a larger hotel bus waiting at the same location but we were told that it was waiting for the airline crews. The driver of the big bus kindly was very helpful and directed us to the proper waiting area. Hotel check-in , bell and restaurant services were great and English was spoken throughout the hotel. The hotel lobby is grand considering it is a stop-over hotel. Rooms are relatively small but is contemporary, clean and efficient and for the price that we were paying, it is a very good value. One of the TV channels provided up-to date flight departure information which comes in handy for the reson why people are staying at the hotel. We ate at the hotel's Chinese restaurant at the balcony level and the food was delicious, especailly the Chinese style steak. There were complimentry breakfast buffet provided at the Western food restaurant on the main level which we did not expect as those buffet could run up to $20 per person. For the room rate of $100 per night for 2 it is a real bargain and the quality of food was reasonable. The airport is undergoing a major expansion which may consider a hotel annex to the terminals similar to that in Vanocuver, Orlando or Hong Kong without the use of shuttles, Until then the Ramada Pudong is an ideal choice after a long filght. It is a upscale Ramada. May 29 2005	Best choice at PuDong Airport	The Ramada is situated at Pudong airport so it is a good choice for a late arrival or early morning departure. There is a shuttle bus that runs between the hotel and the airport every 30 minutes. This departs from the airport opposite Exit No. 9 or 10. Be aware that if you get a taxi most drivers do not understand English. Taxi or bus takes about 5 minutes between the two sites.Check in and out is straight forward. The staff are reasonably friendly and speak good English. Rooms are clean and comfortable, some are a bit small. Biggest problem with the rooms is the noise, if you get a room facing the airport there is noise from both the planes and also the road. This is fine if you have an early flight but if you arrived late don't expect to lie in....Food is okay, the Chinese restaurant has a varied menu and the staff are generally very attentive. Check out the basement bar, drinks are quite expensive and it is often very quiet but when you get the right crowd in here it's a scream. Mar 17 2005	nice for a stopover	Conveniently located for the airport and the magnetic levitation train...but far from everywhere else. If you go into town ensure that the taxi doesn't go to the airport -and have to add ten minutes onto your journey -but takes the slip road just before the hotel - get the concierge to write it in chinese on the little map on the back of the hotel card. This is a good hotel for a stopover and you can just make it into town for a quick morning on the levitation train and metro, and its an exciting way to see shanghai if you don't have any time.The rooms were a good size -beds slightly on the hard side, but after a long long flight you'll sleep. Staff very friendly and attentive without being in your face. Good value if you have to be near the airport or you have a stopover, probably better to stay in town tho' if you are staying more than one night. Dec 15 2004	comfort 	I had the opportunity to stay at the Ramada Pudong Airport Hotel twice over the past two weeks. It's located immediatly adjacent to the airport property, about a 3 minute shuttle bus drive from the terminal. Based upon my experiences on previous visits to Shanghai, the closest acceptable &quot;western style&quot; hotels require at least a 45 minute drive from the airport, so this was a real treat after an 18 hour trip from the US. The executive level floor rooms were very comfortable and spacious. The executive lounge offers free beverages and snacks, and the hotel features two full service restaurants. AT US$95.00/night, including a full breakfast bufet, this hotel is also a very good value. Oct 19 2021 	?????????????? Sep 24 2021 	??????? Jul 30 2021 	?????? Oct 25 2017 	Sehr gutes Hotel und klasse Service"
"Jul 29 2021 	Comfortable and convenient	We found this hotel to be clean, well-equipped and convenient. We booked a standard room, which was comfortably big enough for our young family of 3. The hotel was only 10 minutes walk to the subway station, from there we could get to the city in no time. For those time when we didn't feel like eating outside, there was a good Cantonese restaurant in the same building. The hotel had a money changer offering decent conversion rates, a real time saver because there were not many money changers in the city. In-room Internet wasn't free but was cheap and fast enough (make sure to ring the lobby to activate it). Overall very good for a 3-star hotel. Nov 2 2018	Reasonable 4 star hotel	You might end up here if you book with Wendy Wu 3 star tour. If so this will be one of the better hotels that you will stay at and certainly good enough. Only the bathroom is a bit of a let down with the odd bit of mould but this does not mean that the rooms or bathroom are dirty. Food is okay. Generally a good experience. Oct 31 2018	Very good hotel in a gritty location	Stayed her as part of a tour. was our first stop in China. Rooms comfortable, nice staff, beds firm but OK, Sensational Breakfast (mixed Eastern and Western). Just a bit far out of town, but otherwise good. Was nicest hotel we stayed in in China Sep 24 2018 	Enoyed The Ramada	I started my trip to China in Shanghai, taking a 20 hour train journey from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Ramada is only a 10 minute taxi ride from the Railway Station - can't be walked as too many flyovers between the Station and the Hotel. It is not in the tourist part of town but has a decent coffee shop and although it does have Internet facilities available on site, these are expensive but 2 minutes along the road is a huge Internet ccafe (for want of a better word) where there is good, fast, cheap acccess. Lots of little supermarket shops around, plus a market and a small park where you can join in with the Tai Chi in the mornings when the locals bring their caged birds out to hang in the trees and get fresh air.After my other two stops at hotels in Xian and Beijing, this hotel was definitely the best and the staff were generally very helpful. Dec 3 2017	Good hotel but somewhat remote from the main Shanghai sites	Stayed at this hotel as part of a Wendy Wu Tour. It is now under the Ramada brand. Hotel is a good 3 star. Rooms are of a good size and have a typical hotel layout. They are clean and comfortable, bathroom in good condition - I even had a bath!! Complimentary water in room. Breakfast was included and was good, a selection of both western and chinese food. The only fault with this hotel is that it is quite remote from the main sites of Shanghai. However, the subway is within walking distance and taxis are very cheap. If you go out of the hotel lobby and turn left you will come to a small park where locals practice tai chi in the mornings and gather to dance in the evenings. Also men come to show off their caged songbirds. If you go out of the hotel and turn right there is a little supermarket selling lemonade, wine and snacks. Also if you keep on walking and turn left and follow the block you get a sample of the lifestyle of the locals. It is very safe area. If I were to stay in Shanghai again I would probably choose a more central hotel. Nov 10 2017	Small but OK	My wife and I were on a package tour of China as part of a Wendy Wu Tours &quot;China Experience&quot; tour staying at Shanghai, Xian and Beijing.The first port of call was Shanghai where we stayed at the Ramada CCECC Hotel Zhabei. For a communist country this hotel ws not too bad however, if you are expecting 5 Star luxury then forget it. It is classed as a 4 Star Hotel but this must mean by China standards but even so was still a pleasant place to stay.Breakfast was OK with a variety of Western and Asian food to satisfy most tastes and the rooms were cleaned daily to higher than expected standards. The only fault that we could find was that the standard room only had a double bed which was very hard but bearable.Staff treated us very well and nothing was too much for them to handle with the majority of them being able to converse in English.A reasonably priced hotel within striking distance of the major tourist venues and nearby to a small park that has a variety of locals doing their morning Tai Chi etc. Jun 7 2016	My nicest stay at Shanghai	This is my second time staying at this Hotel in Shanghai. I loved the place so much I stayed twice! The rooms are in good size with all you can wish for including a minibar, cable TV, tea tray, etc. The bathrooms are great, in excellent condition, clean and good size. The shower is powerful and the tub is clean.The CCECC hotel, also called ZhongTu, has 4 lifts so you wont have any trouble regarding the floor you stay on. The reception is big and the staff speak good english. No communication problems whatsoever.This hotel is conviniently located close to the railway station but far enough (5mins) as to stay away from pickpockets (always mind your wallet in Shanghai though). Closest subway station is 5mis walk from the hotel and taxis to major atractions are cheap cheap cheap. Advice: do not stay at hotels way too close to the railway station! Difficult to get a taxi and the are is full of pickpockets!The laundry service was excellent, cheap and fast. Well done guys.My wife and I had a lovely stay at this hotel and I'm sure I will be back for the 3rd time! Until then: Zai jian!"
"Nov 10 2021 	VERY GOOD FOR BUSINESS	Spent 3 nights here and enjoyed the services, clean and spacious rooms, gym, and terrific breakfast. The room was quite impressive for the size, cleanliness and decor. The complaint here is that the lights were insufficient for working, IMO. Room rate was quite good I thought.We had some meetings in the spacious lobby bar which has high prices for tea/coffee but this is not unexpected in such a hotel; but one of our meetings was held with complimentary beverages due to my local rep making a deal.  The gym is very large but the equipment is average; the size of facility and lack of staff or users made it more like a quiet cavern on that Friday night. Neighborhood had so many bars and nice restaurants, and I really liked the residential feel. There are tall and leafy cottonwood trees lining the avenue for a long distance, and many quiet residential buildings in this area. Plenty of tennis being played on the Saturday so activity is strong around the hotel. This is good.Recommended hotel and neighborhood. Aug 8 2021 	Good hotel good location dont confuse with a hotel at the stadium (similar name)	Most of the reviewers are not smart enough to check that this hotel is not the Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel which is located at the stadium, but a different hotel. I got a room in some management rooms - you can get their only by using a card in a lift which will take you to the upper floors. It is a good deal as i had breakfast included plus free internet. In addition to it you have your own breakfast area if you want. I liked the location - i was close to all the places i needed to go. Plus there is a great Mexican place Zappatas not far from the hotel. I really liked going there as i was slightly sick of the Chinese food. Jul 25 2021 	Poor Management Excellent staff. 4 star hotel	After having stayed here many times over the last 4 years, the hotel has deteriorated to 4 stars:- Poor management from a Hong Kong Assistant Manager who is arrogant and detached from his clientelle.- Stupid yellow smiley faces being worn by hotel staff (is this Mcdonalds ???)- Cheap brown 'new' uniforms being worn by embarrased reception and concierge staff.More importantly is the continual messing about with room rates and benefits.As a Regal Reward Platinum Member I was upgraded to Regal Club floor - only to be told 3 days later that I could not have any of the benefits.Unfortuantely the General Manager is on holiday and unable to respond to my complaint.In Shanghia, you can go better.... Apr 3 2021 	excellent business hotel	I've stayed here twice - for 10 days end of March 2021 &amp; earlier on 6 days in Nov 2018. I like this hotel. Check-in was smooth, room's spacious, clean, quiet, restaurant staff friendly &amp; helpful. Since I was here over a weekend, I used the gym which is very well-equipped. There's a spa &amp; swimming pool here as well. You can play tennis &amp; squash as well.The hotel's located near the business area, no where near the popular tourist spots. I could walk to the office blocks in 5 minutes. A large park is just across the hotel &amp; it's a pleasant walk across this park to the business area. The park is full of activity all day - people playing at the basketball courts, kids in the playground, people enjoying a stroll by the small lakes, &amp; in the evenings folks gather to dance (line-dance, ballroom, etc) which always attracts a big crowd.The location is in what used to be the French Quarter of old Shanghai so there are lots of colonial buildings to look at. The streets around the hotel are tree-lined &amp; away from the hustle &amp; bustle of the main roads. Good for exploring. Mar 12 2021 	i hated it how depressing	if this is the regal east in the football stadium, think twice about staying there....not nice at all. the rooms, mines anyway, was so small and the furnishings basic, more like a travel lodge. view to the back of a stadium, shower height for a midget, bed hard, towels grey, room smelled of smoke etc etc, and it wasnt cheap at 897 a night. staff not nice to me either, e.g. I asked for a breakfast included rate, they wouldnt help me with it at all. they had the cheek to call my room to ask about the service of the stay, when I had put do not disturb on....they really didnt have the first clue about service. No bath robe or slippers in the room either. The most depressing stay as a solo traveller yet...never going back. Nov 18 2018 	Got what we paid for; good location	We had a great last minute rate on the Regal as the accommodation we were supposed to stay in became unavailable unexpectedly. I would not consider the hotel a 5-star hotel but would think it measures up very well as a 4-star. The room decor was dated and the bed was harder than usual. However, everything worked well so we really had no complaints. We liked the pillow selection option and thought it a nice touch. The breakfast spread was very good (much wider than the Four Seasons Shanghai) and we loved its location. The hotel didn't have much of a personality but it was certainly clean, well appointed and more than adequate for our purposes, which was a night's stay before travelling to the airport. Aug 26 2018 	Exceptional Service	Exceptional &amp; personable service from the moment I checked in for this biz trip until (I'm betting) I check out tomorrow... Breakfast, dinner and brunch buffets amazing and reasonably priced. My back was bothering me and I requested a feather pillow top (thinking it unlikely) and within 10 minutes, housekeeping had it on my bed:). I couldn't resist pushing my luck and called to see if I could get an ergonomical desk chair and it magically appeared. Massages always available and very good. Pool incredible. Concierge resolved a taxi charge to Yunan Gardens that I questioned without a second thought. Laundry service within hours. Good, consistent internet service. Room service always within 15-20 minutes.Maybe the quality of service is just this high in Shanghai but if I return, I'm staying here. Aug 18 2018	Alright but smallish room	Service is ok, better than at other Chinese hotels, but again nothing impressive. The room was quite small, and the decor a bit passe', but all in all functional and clean. I liked the local Chinese restaurant's food, but I am sure there are better options a few minutes from the hotel.I found this hotel too expensive (RMB 1200+15% fees) for its quality (but perhaps Shanghai is like this, I do not know honestly), had to pay for Internet (normal in Chinese hotels..) and breakfast was not included.. Four days after checking out they still haven't cancelled the pre-authorization on my credit card, which is a bit annoying. It is convenient if you come from Hongqiao airport, less so from Pudong. Aug 3 2018 	Clean haven in Shanghai's French neighbourhood	Have been in quite a few hotels in Shanghai, but since a local friend recommended this hotel to us, we have stayed here twice. It is a clean haven in a nice neighbourhood. The staff is friendlier than in most Shanghai hotels. The rooms are quite large for a Shanghai hotel. The bed was enormous!The only problem I had with the room is the difficulty to regulate the temperature. The aircon seemed to be set fixed to 24 degrees which is far too cold when it is 37 outside. Whatever we tried, we could not get the temperature up or the aircon fan down.The food in the hotel is not special, but in the neighbourhood there are some very good local restaurants.Before we have stayed in the other Regal East Asia hotel in the stadium, be this one is definitely better! Jul 6 2018 	Good business hotel far from tourist sites	Stayed for four nights in June 2018. Was attending an international conference. The room was nice, although the bed was a little hard and not particularly comfortable. The staff was polite and reasonably helpful. The food at the restaurant was good, although similar food could be found for about 1/3 the price about a block away at a local Chinese restaurant. Although the hotel was adequate, it is very far from most areas that tourists are interested in, so is recommended more for convention/business travelers. Mar 23 2018	Perfectly Fine	I have stayed at the Regal a number of times over the past few years when we come down from Beijing for a break. It is a good hotel but definitely not a destination hotel. It is a place to go if you are looking for clean and comfortable in a fairly good area.The rooms are pretty good and the beds are comfortable. Internet is quite quick and housekeeping do a good job. This is very definitely a business hotel - I probably wouldn't recommend it to a tourist.The concierge is helpful if you have a simple request but they can really struggle if you are looking for something complicated. For example we were trying to find the location of a restaurant and we had to prompt them to go and find out instead of just saying &quot;I don't know.&quot;The bar is pretty good and prompt though the drinks aren't outstanding. I mus admit that I have never eaten there tho I often go across the road to Kevin cafe for cheaper eats.The subway is very close which is good but it can be hard to get taxis (which is true for a lot of hotels in Shanghai).All in all a good business hotel but probably not worth the price. Mar 16 2018 	Great Hotel for Price	Hotel is in diplomat area on Heng Shan Road. It is a beautiful street lined with trees that bloom in the spring. The hotel is in front of the Shanghai International Tennis Center and near a lot of pretty old houses in Shanghai. I am a regular in the hotel because of proximity to my offices. But it is close to good restaurants, shopping and a lot of bars and pubs on Heng Shan Road. Breakfast in hotel is a big spread and OK quality. Parking is free for guests and the car park is well lit and big.Here are the negatives: The regular rooms are kind of old and need upgrading so I choose usually to go to club floor rooms by paying a bit extra. Heng Shan road is very busy on Friday nights and can be difficult to get a taxicab. I am spoilt with free Internet in many hotels in China and hate them charging US$15 per night for it. As a guy there are sometimes pimps wandering outside Heng Shan road offering &quot;services&quot; and they are a nuisance.But all in all a very decent hotel for the price. Jan 8 2018 	A good choice	Having lived in Shanghai it is nice to return to this area and this particular hotel. For those wanting the hussle and bussle of Nanjing Road / The Bund head for JW Marriott / Le Meridien etc, however this hotel is in the middle of the old French Concession / diplonatic area and has lots of lovely bars and restaurants within a short walk - you just have to look around a little bit.The metro station is close by, the bars and restaurants of Hengshan Road are minutes away and a taxi can take you to the famous parts in 5-10 Minutes. The hotel has been refurbished and the standard (deluxe) rooms are spacious and well-appointed. We did not upgrade to the club floor as we preferred to have breakfast out in one of the little coffee shops in the adjacent tree-lined avenues. I am not sure it is worth the extra as the standard rooms are great.Service is good and the location is quiet and nice with great access to all parts of the city. Restaurants close by include Thai, Shanghainese, Vietnamese, Indian, Japanese. Bars include Cottons, Sachas, Irish Bar...Overall a big recommend. Dec 10 2007 	Just OK	The hotel is OK; very friendly staff, however it is not really close to anyplace and is quite expensive. The breakfast buffet has a wide selection but is not the best I've had. There are so many options in Shanghai, I'd prefer to stay at a different location next time. Nov 30 2007 	Good place	The hotel has a shuttle that you can arrange to meet you at the airport. It is not cheap, but it is very nice to be met at the airport with a sign with you name on it after a 14 hour flight. The staff at the airport speak English, but the drivers do not. Nice rooms, in nice location (in the day time) Close to a park and in a quieter area. I felt very comfortable walking around in the day time. Another associate was not a happy when walking after dark in this area, he had many offer of girls that he did not appreciate.They will ask if you want to upgrade to the Regal club floors for an extra charge, but unless you plan to have a lot of drinks at happy hour, or have a lot of time off during the day, you will pay a large premium for free Internet and breakfastDon't worry too much about getting a room on a high floor, the air pollution in Shanghai is so bad that you will not be able to see that far. The view is a bit clearer on the weekends compared to weekdays.The rooms are nice, with individual climate control that worked well. The beds were a bit firm, but this seems to be a common style in China, and I was still able to sleep well. The front desk staff had excellent English skills, and even the housekeeping staff spoke English. The breakfast buffet was excellent. It had a large choice of both western and Chinese dishes to choose from. You could get the chef to prepare eggs the way you wanted. Food hygiene was good, I had no problems after eating here. The lunch and dinner is good here as well, but much more expensive that other restaurants in the area. There is a large over priced shopping area a few blocks away. Lots of designer names, but with price tags higher than in Europe.The room had wired Internet that worked well. The room safe was large enough to put a laptop computer in. Jul 27 2007 	A home away from home	The Regal is located very centrally in Shanghai and is close to many restaurants and bars. A short 10min walk and you are at a crossroads of large multi-story shopping malls. Whether electronics or fashion is your thing this is the place to go.The 5th floor has been recently renovated and has been finished superbly. Photos attached. The 5th floor is part of the Regal Club and is available by upgrade. The extra cost of about 400 Yuan is well worth the extra comfort. There are also significant benefits &amp; discounts offered as part of the deal. E.g. Free evening beverages in the club lounge between 5:30 - 8:00, breakfast in the club lounge on the 4th floor (4th floor also newly renovated), 2 items pressed per day, 50% discount on the mini bar, 30% discount off of all food &amp; beverages within the Hotel, Discounted laundry service, express laundry at the standard laundry rate plus many more benefits. It is easy to make the savings of the extra 400 Yuan to make it worth your while.They have also renovated the lobby bar and restaurant and they have again done an outstanding job. As a regular to the Regal, I was very impressed with the upgrades that have been made to the Hotel. Mar 5 2007 	A pleasant stay	We stayed at this hotel in May 2006. It is in the French concession which is a lovely, characterful area. There are quite a few restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. It is a lovely area to go strolling. Right across from the hotel is a small supermarket. Although not in the business/tourist district, we took taxis and they were very reasonable. It is helpful to have the Name and address of the hotel and places you want to go to, on hand in chinese. Some cab drivers do not understand English.The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. We complained about our room smelling of smoke and we were moved to non-smoking floor. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with cable TV. The bathrooms are great as well.The breakfast buffet had a nice selection of Eastern, Western and fruit.We bought snacks from the supermarket across from the hotel. We were about 5 minutes cab ride away from one of the big markets in Shanghai.As female travellers we felt very safe in this area and hotel. Feb 23 2007 	ehhh......	not bad, but you can find better. kinda in the middle of nowhere, so prepare to take cabs everywhere. rooms are clean, but kinda plain. bed is so so. Nov 21 2006	you can do a lot better	there are a lot of much better choices in shanghai than this place. in need of updating. indifferent service. inconvenient location. Apr 5 2006	Great service a delight	My children and I had a wonderful time this past week at this hotel. The room was well-appointed and clean, the beds comfortable. Felix Hu, the senior sales manager with whom I made the reservations, communicated with me by email quickly. He also arranged for our train tickets to Hangzhou where my daughters and I stayed for three days upon our arrival to China before we visited Shanghai. He had a car pick us up at the airport, give us our train tickets, and take us to the train station. On returning to Shanghai, they had taken care of the luggage we didn't want to take with us to Hangzhou and had our room ready. The staff was extraordinarily helpful, all speaking English. The hotel is located in the French Concession area, a lovely part of Shanghai. It's not in the center of the tourist areas or the business district but a much nicer and less crowded area. We took taxis to get to our destinations which cost usually less than $2 each time. The buffet breakfast in the hotel was ample and with great selection. My daughters enjoyed the bowling alley in the hotel several times during our stay. On leaving, Mr. Hu gave us a beautiful photo book of Shanghai to remember our stay. We travel a good deal for holidays and would happily stay here again. Feb 27 2006 	A little out of the way	For a Shanghai hotel it really is pretty good for its value. The property is owned by the Hong Kong Regal Chain and one can tell that they paid enough attention in order to cater to westerners. The hotel is a little out of the way so one needs to tack on an extra 10-15 minutes per cab ride. The rooms are fairly large by Shanghai 4 star standard. Unfortunately the carpet is a little worn out and the place can use a little updating. The staff throughout the hotel is very friendly and efficient. For budget travelers I would highly recommend it. If your company is paying for it then head on over to Sofitel or JW Marriott where you will be closer to the business districts. The internet connection is a little pricey. I would just walk around the corner to the internet cafe where 3RMB takes care of one hour of log in. Jan 29 2005	OK	This hotel get's mine &quot;above average&quot; rating in fact only for the great and spacious room as well for the delicious breakfast buffet with plenty of Asian and Western high quality food.The total hotel concept is however rather &quot;cold&quot; and check-in feels more like entering a governmental building than a relaxing hotel. I have missed the feeling of being welcome; I just had the feeling of having been booked in &quot;a place to sleep&quot;. I wouldn't advise this hotel for a long holiday stay, but it is OK for a short business visit. Jun 17 2004	Nice place but a little noisy...	We stayed 7 nights at the Regal in June 2004. Upon arrival, the hotel staff spoke excellent English and were very pleasant to deal with. The rooms are fairly nice and spacious including these nice down comforters that almost felt as comfortable as the Westin's Heavenly Beds. My only complaint was they placed us in a room next to one that had construction so we heard multiple pounding noises from the work throughout the afternoon and evenings. I would not suggest room service, as the food was mediocre and there are tons of nice and cheaper restaurants nearby. Most service charges in the hotel were fairly high and comparable to any NYC hotel which also quite surprised me. An example includes paying $4USD for a Coke at the hotel when you get one across the street at the store for $0.30. The hotel is also located on the West side of Shanghai so its a bit farther from most tourist attractions. Although, taxis and the metro system there made commuting to those other areas fairly simple and cheap. Aug 28 2021 	???????????"
"Oct 8 2021 	Decent hotel interesting location	This hotel is actually inside a soccer stadium. If you stay in a room between 1st and 9th floor you won't have a street view (you will be looking at the inside/lobby of the stadium. The basic rooms are slow but very clean and well-equipped. The hotel has a nice restaurant which serves great breakfast (combination of Chinese and western food). It has a health spa in the lobby which looks plush from the outside. There are some stores and a bar also located in the stadium. Not sure if there is anything else nearby. Overall, not crazy about the location but the hotel itself is very nice as a 4-star facility. Sep 17 2021 	Brilliant. Great rooms food and staff.	Impressive lobby. Very clean hotel.. Big rooms. Everything almost new. Great breakfasts. Swimming pool, massage, fitness. Everything you need. Hotel is the part of Shanghai Stadium (built.in). Taxi drivers had problems to find the hotel. You have to show them the key with chinese name and address of the hotel. Oct 26 2018	All depends which room you get	Stayed for a five-night business trip and I have to say that both room standard and service quality is extremely variable, depending on which room you get or whom of the many staff you deal with. On the website the hotel looks like a good idea and very different from others as it claims to have great views of the inside of Shanghai Stadium. As I had booked a &quot;stadium view&quot; room I was looking forward to this experience but as it turned out my room looked onto an interior staircase of the stadium, and most of my colleagues had the same problem. Many of the &quot;stadium view&quot; rooms are very small and most of them pitch-dark even during the day as the do not get any sunlight at all. My second room, to which I was only moved after hours of negotiation and dealing with no less than five staff, was very different: bright, airy, large windows, views (of a flyover, but at least it did have a view of sorts). Some staff were very nice and courteous, others were plain rude. I felt that as long as operations were running smoothly staff were in a well-rehearsed friendly routine, but whenever things went wrong many of them turned into a &quot;not my problem, try somebody else&quot; mode. Overall, an average experience. Aug 3 2018 	Very Convenient Hotel	This hotel was selected for me by my company, so I did not know what to expect. From my research, it appeared to be far away from the downtown area of Shanghai. It proved to be a very convenient location, as it was easy to get to it by taxi. It is also a block away from the subway. Considering the extensive road construction in Shanghai, not all hotels are easy to get to, even though they may be more central, and not all hotels necessarily have a great supply of taxis waiting outside.My room was very large, and quite clean. Their breakfast buffet had many choices - typical Chinese, Japanese, and European/North American.There was consistently a fleet of taxis waiting outside, which given their inexpensive price, was my preferred mode of transportation in Shanghai. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to my friends, for sure. Jul 13 2018 	Great experience at the Regal	Stayed for one night at the Regal. Although I had only booked a club floor room, I was upgraded to a club floor suite when I checked in - a pleasant surprise! Suite was very well appointed with central lighting control, electronic blinds, 3 LCD TV's and a massive bathroom with a muti-head shower. Several of the items (including beer) in the mini-bar were complementary as well - a nice touch.The room included buffet breakfast, which was good, as well as high speed internet. Can't think of anything negative to say except that the location may not be ideal for tourists, since it was a longish (35 min) , 45 RMB cab ride from Pudong to the hotel. Mar 4 2018 	great hotel around us$100	stayed here many time for business purposeif its your first visit and will stay short better find different location around bundif you are looking for a budget hotel and a taste of local area this is a good optionhotel is located inside shanghai stadium walking distance its a great local shopping area (xu jia hui )and subway stationits a great 4 star hotel ,rooms are of good size the upper the bigger,the stadium get widder in the upper part and so do the roomsonly con is that the building is inside the stadium so just arriving to the road means a good walk any way is not far from anything you can get by taxi to every tourist attraction in 10 to 15 minutesfirst time i stayed was little strange in time became a repeat guess mainly because of price and room size rooms in higher executive room are really BIG very good for an extended stay Oct 23 2017 	After location confusion a good experience	The Regal Hotel group should be scolded for (purposeful deception) . It has two Shanghai properties, both called Regal East Asia. One of them (not this one) has the word &quot;international&quot; innocuously inserted into its title, but it is also frequently omitted. So if you book this hotel thinking that you're on Hengshan Road (a happening nightlife area) you're wrong. This hotel is located inside the Shanghai Sports stadium ground, set back from the road. Easy to miss unless your taxi driver has been here before. Other than the location switch, this hotel does exceed expectations. The outfittings are relatively new and high quality, rooms have plenty of light and are well designed (for use of space). All amenities are provided, as if this were a five star hotel. The pool is also excellent: 20 meters, infinity edge, and clean. And, rooms have a view of the sports stadium. The downside is that this hotel is located in a &quot;local&quot; but up-and coming middle class area of Shanghai. It's out of the way (centrally) but convenient for taking the metro, being on the intersection of two metro lines. If you don't mind the southwest Shanghai location and lack of foreign-oriented diversions, this hotel could work for you. Oct 8 2017 	Repeat visit	This is a repeat business stay for me.This time I got upgraded to the non smoking Regal Premium eleventh floor.The room was clean with modern design, outfit and operation.View over the city.PROs; plush towels, safe large enough for laptop computer storage; business size room; flatscreen TV; prompt staff service; quiet; extended choice in breakfast food; nearby access to metro/subwayCON: cramped office space for business work; no local radio broadcast; expensive internet and breakfast extra; Jun 27 2017 	Lost our privacy	Great location, and rooms were clean and comfortable. Interesting hotel outlook. However, when we checked-in, the front desk persuaded me not to pay a deposit...and if we agreed, they will take away all the foods and drinks out from the fridge. And seems nothing lost, then we agreeded, later when we arrived the room for already 30 mins, and we were taking a rest, I was sleeping on bed, and my boyfriend was walking around with his little shorts...suddenly, someone opened the door by their keys...and we shouted. Is their staff. I cried what's happend? And she said she didn't know guests were inside, and she was coming to collect all the foods and drinks in the fridge...Oh~I thought this was annoyed, you know? Since we have been here and checked in for already 30 mins...and this is strange for the staff to come in suddenly, and it ruined our privacy, I was going to complain but she said sorry to us, so I forgave her then. Besides this experience, the hotel is nice. Jun 20 2017 	Solid Hotel at a Good Price	I stayed 4 nights at the Regal Shanghai East Asia hotel and had a pretty good experience. I booked this hotel based on the room rates and the close proximity to the Metro Station.Check-in was fine, apart from I had to point out that breakfast was included in my room rate. The room itself was better than I expected and was a pretty decent size and standard. The bathroom was clean.The Metro station is a 2 minute walk away and from there the rest of Shanghai is easily accessible - I just wish the trains ran an hour or two later at night! You pass a Starbucks on the way to the Metro station and there is a supermarket built in to the other side of the stadium.This is a good hotel, and while it doesn't have any of Shanghai's main attractions on it's doorstep, I was willing to sacrifice that in order to save some cash. The Metro is efficient enough and taxis are cheap so that the location doesn't make much difference. Nov 15 2006 	Interesting location!	I stayed at the Regal Shanghai for 6 nights very recently. As the hotel part of the Shanghai stadium, it is fairly easy for taxi riders to find. The fare from Pudong airport was about 170 RMB. The hotel reception is ok, we had booked a Regal Club room so we used the check-in at the 12th floor. The lounge staff were very helpful and nice all throughout our stay, assisting us with restaurant bookings etc. There was a lady called Kris and she was a star! The lounge (breakfast and evening drinks + snacks are included in the rate plan) is a bit old fashioned but ok. The selection for food is limited but as the lounge is never very busy (only saw about a max of 10 people there at any one time), I guess it is not worth for the hotel to provide more. Everything we had and tried was perfectly fine. Our room, 1215, was one of the old rooms. The hotel is having re-vamp at the moment and quite rightly so. The furniture is very 1980's and the carpet has seen better days. The size of the room was great and everything worked. The rates in general are decent considering that most 3-4* hotels in Shanghai are very pricey. The tube station is only about 5 mins walk away and there are plenty of taxis. I didn't use any of the hotel facilities (shops, spa etc) but they all look ok. Moods bar, also on the 12th Floor, is ok but lacks atmosphere. The French Concession is a great place to wonder about and Sasha's (a western style bar) is not far. M on Bund was great for a meal as was Shintori. The People 7 bar was very trendy but service wasn't that great. There is a bar on Julu Road called the Goodfellas ( a bit seedy) but they give our free beer if you go early in the evening! A river cruise in the evening is a must - the view is amazing. Perhaps one of the nicest days we had was a day trip to one of the canal towns. The nearest one is only about 1 1/2 hrs from Shanghai and the tour buses leave from Shanghai stadium. A top tip - you might need some help in buying the tickets unless your Chinese is great. Another highlight was a trip to the Propaganda Poster Arts Museum. It can be a bit difficult to find but once you get there, it's very interesting. I will definitely go back to Shanghai again but most likely will stay somewhere a bit more central. Nov 10 2006 	Great and a bit different !	Stayed for 6 nights on a leisure break in October 2006.Was a bit apprehensive as this brand was not a known quantity, however I needn't have worried.Location is slightly out of centre, to the south west of the main attractions, but the hotel is very accessible to metro station (2 mins walk), and cabs are easy to get. I think the location is a plus point as it means you get much better value than a comparable place in a tourist location.The building itself, within Shanghai Stadium, is very impressive.My wife and I stayed in a Regal Club room (there was a special offer on the hotel website of USD 130 per night). This entitled us to check-in on the 'club' (12th) floor, and meant we were entitled to free breakfast, evening drinks and canapes, and various other extras. I would highly recommend booking this class of room.The club lounge had an excellent view over the stadium, we were lucky that there was a pop concert on the first night of our stay - very interesting !Our room was very large, clean, with all the facilities to be expected of a 4-star property. The decoration was a bit old fashioned for our taste, I would have preferred something a bit more contemporary. Not a major problem, however, and everything was in good condition. Bed was very hard, I actually like that, but be warned if you like a soft mattress.We did not dine at the hotel except to take the complimentary breakfast and canapes, however these were of good quality. The drinks were also a bonus - basically a full bar from which you could help yourself - quite easy to overdo it !All staff at the hotel were great, very polite, excellent English, and extremely helpful. They booked us restaurants, trips, cabs, the works.In short, I would not hesitate to stay here again, don't let the apparent 'remote' location put you off.PS Some friends of ours booked one of the cheapest rooms - it was OK but pretty small and a bit tatty - I would def recommend a higher class room. Oct 30 2006 	loved the hotel	going to shanaghai to visit our daughter who was working there. booked this 4* hotel for four nights, on 6th october, fabulous price of 97 pounds sterling room only, for 2 people. did not expect much at this price very pleasantly surprised. gorgeous hotel. staff excellent. accommodation first-class. did not have time to use their excellent leisure facilities. hotel located very near the metro. which is very convenient and extremely cheap - about 28 pence to the bund, and other places of interest. definitely recommend. Oct 14 2006 	Very nice hotel	This is a very nice hotel. Our room was very comfortable, good ammenities. All staff were very helpful. Pool and hot tub area are nice - close by 9:30 PM. Be careful not to confuse this hotel with the Regal INTERNATIONAL East Asia Hotel which is located in the French concession and closer to the city center. This is a great hotel if you will be flying out of Hong Qiao Airport (only took about 20 minutes to get there.) But, otherwise it is a bit far from the major attractions. Metro stops are placed quite far apart in Shanghai. The hotel is actually attached to the stadium - (makes it easier for cab drivers to find). You can get to the hotel from Pudong airport using public transport (mag lev to green metro line, change at people's square to red line - exit metro to the left and walk about 5-10 min.) but, if you have luggage we would recommend taking a taxi. They do offer miles but room rate has to be at least 700 CYN. We booked on the internet for $57. Overall, we were very happy here, especially for such a good rate and would stay again especially if flying out of HongQaio. Jun 15 2006	Great Hotel and Value!	Although The Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel is a 3 star hotel, I found it much much better than the 4 star hotel I stayed at in Beijing (the Swissotel). Reasons I liked the Regal Shanghai East Asia Hotel: my room and bathroom were clean; the room size was lager than I expected for a standard room; the room was decorated in a modern and simple yet elegant way; the staff was friendly and spoke English well; the subway is just around the corner and up the block; not far from most attractions by subway. I cannot think of a complaint about it really... Nov 13 2021 	???????????? Oct 2 2021 	?????????? Sep 2 2021 	????????????????? Aug 11 2021	?????????????? Jan 19 2021	????????????????????? Oct 24 2018 	????????????????"
"Nov 18 2021 	Improvement needed to meet the standards of Mariott	The setting of the rooms are good but there is still room for significant improvement, specifically on the following topics :1) internet connection very slow2) room sometimes very cold3) breakfast times do not correspond with the times indicated in the guest services directory. Directory says 6.00 am, in reality it is 6.30 am and, even then, staff was not fully ready.4) Beers in the Zpark bar are not served in the appropriate glasses.At this stage I would not recommend this hotel but could revise my opinion if the general service level is improved. I consider that the above topics could be fixed rather quick.Luc Godefroidluc.godefroid@us.henkel.com May 8 2021 	Promising First Visit	When in Shanghai I usually prefer to stay in a more central location such as Nanjing Rd but this new hotel offered an attractive introductory corporate rate so decided to give it a go. The location is some way from city centre and attractions but it is situated right beside a metro station. This is the first time I have made use of the metro in Shanghai and I found it to be cheap, clean and easy to use although it can be congested at busy times. The hotel is built directly on top of a shopping mall which also contains plenty of restaurants but part from the mall there is not much else in the area although there is a lot of construction and development work taking place in the area which suggests that this may change soon.As commented in previous reviews the hotel occupies the top half of the building only with check in on the 25th floor. This involves separate lifts to the reception desk and then on to the rooms which is one of my pet hates. It is further frustrating that some of the hotel facilities such as the fitness centre are on the lower levels. I did try the fitness centre and although well equipped was exceptionally busy as it is widely used by the general public as well as hotel guests. Admittedly my visit to the fitness centre was at peak time. The rooms themselves are well furnished and comfortable as you should expect from a new hotel.The hotel offers both Western and south east Asian restaurants but given the high number of eateries in the mall below these are quiet which is a great shame as I ate in the Asian restaurant on my last night and the food was truly excellent.Overall this was a promising visit to a new hotel and I will give it consideration for future visits Apr 28 2021 	Good standard 5-star fare but location may not suit everybody	If you're in Shanghai for business and your meetings are mostly at the Pudong area (Lujiazhui for example), then you will find that this hotel's location is simply too far away from the action. That's exactly what I found out when I first had a meeting near Science &amp; Technology Centre at 9 am, then have to be back at Huaihai Road for a 10.30 am meeting, then lunch at Yan'an West Road near Jiangsu Road, before finally having to go to Lujiazhui again for a 4 pm presentation. Whew!If I'm not Chinese or don't recognise Chinese characters, I'd have been forced to take a taxi to complete this juggernaut. And trust me, the traffic jams in Shanghai make a short 6km route last hours, so that'd make me late, late, late! So I depended on the metro, but even that was no fun having to cross from one end of Shanghai to the other end!So, I reckon if you want something more central, choose those hotels at Nanjing West Road, Lujiazhui or even Nanjing East Road. I've earlier reviews of some of the hotels in these areas, which I stayed in during the halcyon days when my budget was fatter and my boss less concerned about minute travel costs.So, thanks to the current global economic crisis, I've been &quot;exiled&quot; to this part of Shanghai, which is a good 15-20km away from the heart of action. Granted there is a nice mall right beneath the hotel, but it's just the ONLY one mall with nothing much around (unless you love shopping for old computers and IT knick-knacks at the &quot;mall&quot; opposite). But if you like taking the metro and don't mind the (massive) crowds in one of the world's most populous cities, the fact that this hotel is located just above a metro station will find favour with you. Getting food quickly, shopping for some groceries to fill up your room's mini-bar and going to the other parts of Shanghai served by the metro would never be an issue. Convenience is the tagline here.Amenities wise, this hotel suffers from the weird design of those hotels which form part of a big building which is actually an office block. Those who'd stayed at the Grand Hyatt Jinmao at Lujiazhui and JW Marriott at Tomorrow Square will know what I mean. Having the lobby at the 25th floor, then the gym being on the 10th and your room on the 38th and the breakfast place on the 26th floor, and all using other elevators, will be confusing enough for anybody, me included. Imagine having a dip at the gym pool and wrapped in your bathrobes, you take the elevator with other guests and office workers to the 25th floor lobby, then walk with dripping water to the other elevator some 20m away and then take another elevator to your room on the 46th floor. One reason why I did not use my trunks despite having high hopes of doing so this time round.But then again, if you're a sucker for high-rise hotels and love those views from a 46th floor glass window, this one is for you. Yes, admittedly, I loved the view from my room too, but as a frequent visitor to Shanghai, there wasn't too much for me to be thrilled about. And we aren't talking about a view of the Lujiazhui financial district and the Bund is more than 20km away.All in all, this new hotel had all the touches of a 5-star outfit and the software, especially the wait staff at the breakfast place and the front desk staff, lived up to expectations. I think good training plays a strong role here and I am happy Renaissance is able to achieve this in a city not truly known for good service and the people usually deemed less than courteous.Oh, one small (quirky) thing to mention: the suggestive uniform of the staff... I notice they are made to wear a coat or just a suit with no shirt, blouse or even a T-shirt under it! So you can see the cleavage of some of the more well-endowed staff and the chest hairs of those others who are more stout and erm, manly. Gosh! I know I should not complain since it's a feast for the eyes, but still.... haha Apr 10 2021 	Convenient to Hongqiao Airport/Shopping/Metro Station	Extremely pleased with my recent visit. Very modern 60 storey hotel sits atop large Cloud Nine shopping center and main Metro line (Zhongshan Park station: lines 2, 3,4). Within 5-6 miles of Hongqiao Business Park, Shanghai Innovation Business Park and Southern Railway Station. Easy to find at night since the building is outlined by neon blue lights. I could be over in Pudong area across the river in &lt;40 minutes by straight subway line (avoid traffic and taxi fare). Same subway line will drop you off at People's Square, Nanjing Road, and the Bund, in 15 minutes. Good sized rooms are new and very modern with comfortable beds and flat panel TVs. Executive lounge is unique dual-level; very large, comfortable and decently stocked with drinks and light snacks brought to you by attentive hotel staff during certain hours. Plentiful breakfast buffet in morning. Azur restaurant has standard hotel fare. Multiple choices for dining (both fast food and sit down) at the Cloud Nine shopping center without ever leaving the buidling. If you fly in to Shanghai domestically to Hongqiao airport and are doing business or sightseeing on this side of the river, then this is very convenient. If flying in to Shanghai Pudong International airport and doing business in Pudong area then I would recommend the Renaissance Pudong. Feb 13 2021 	Easy Access Location	The hotel sits next to / atop a shopping mall (Cloud Nine Shopping Mall - http://shanghai.iknowthiscity.com/?p=229). The metro runs under the mall in the basement level and is easily accessible from the hotel without having to go outside. The metro station is Zhongshan Park on line #2, with interchanges to lines #3 and #4. Line #2 runs east-west and will take you to most tourist destinations. RMB3 will get you to destinations west of the river like Peoples Park (Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Grand Theatre, etc.) and RMB4 gets you east across the river to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jinmao Tower, etc. RMB4 will also get you to Long Yang Lu station where you can get the MagLev to Pudong (RMB40). For RMB 44, you can get from Pudong to the hotel easily within ONE HOUR which is cheaper than a taxi (fare is about RMB200) and faster, especially during weekdays.Within the mall, there are dozens of restaurants and fast food places. Almost all menus are in Chinese and English. The location is more in the residential area, so the staff are not as fluent in English as in tourist areas such as Nanjing Road, but sufficient to get by.The hotel itself lives up to the Renaissance name. The staff is fluent in English and professional. The only minor drawback is that the lobby is on the 25th floor which means you have to take one elevator to the 25th and then another elevator to your room. Strangely the hotel does not offer a turn-down service. Otherwise I recommend this hotel if you want to get away from the central part of Shanghai. The shanghai metro is very easy to use and get around, offering a cheaper, faster way to get around, making this hotel a great value. Nov 25 2021 	soggiorno fra le nuvole !!!! Nov 19 2021 	??????

"The bed is good and also the clublounge service	The title say's about all what is better then average I normally experience. the staff was very helpfull and friendly. Stayed here for one night. Stayed in more hotels in Shanghai with about the same (company)-rate as this hotel and have to state this is my last stay here. I took the clublounge upgrade for reason same price as seperate additional internet + breakfast + lounge-promotion-stuff. The building is clearly from the older architecture style of Hotel-building. There is no separate shower (in bathtub with curtain) and the room was not spacy. Location good for starting travel west for Suzhou or evening stuff in Puxi. Jun 11 2021 	VEry Nice Hotel	Stayed for 2 nights at the Renaissance hotel in the middle of the Shanghai business district in Sep 2017.The location is fantastic and the rooms were great. The staff and their service was also very good.They tool care of me well considering this was my first trip to Shaighai.Breakfast buffet spread was huge and tasty as well.The rooms were bright and clean. The gym facility was fully functional and useful with good stock of towels and water.We orderd pizza in room service when we wanted something quick and to our surprise it tasted so delicious, we ended up ordering more of the same. May 13 2021 	Speedways to Progress!	I moved to the Renaissance Yangtze Hotel as it was just across my Business Associates' Offices. Breakfast was not included in the price &amp; was quite expensive, though good. The view of the Speedways and speeding traffic was something. Showed what China was all about. The foot massage lady was great. She also comes to the Room if you want.Rooms were really nice and staff was good. Seems like the Management was very good at training their staff. Apr 27 2021 	Exhibition centre	Some hotels near to exhibition centres can be &quot;well used&quot; and &quot;jaded&quot;, but not this one.The Renaissance offers sumptuous beds and very quiet rooms. Everywhere is perfectly clean and well maintained. The restaurants are very well serviced and all the staff are very friendly and helpful. After long, tiring days at the nearby exhibition centre, this hotel is a treat to savour.If you are thinking of shopping at one of the nearby shopping malls, make sure that you have a large limit on your credit card. The goods may carry a very well known European or Japanese brand name, but they also carry a very high price tag. Curiously, the hotel's own shop has some attractive souvenirs to offer, and they will readily accept the principle of bargaining. Just be prepared to spend some time to reach a final price! Apr 18 2021 	Comfortable City Hotel	I stayed for one week on business, but managed a couple of personal days for sightseeing.Checkin at mid-day was fast and pleasant: I took the club upgrade, which entitles you to breakfast, and 'happy hour' for free drinks and nibbles in the evening, in the penthouse amongst other perks. Refreshments in the lobby were rather expensive, even for a 4/5 star hotel. My room was well appointed with a kingsize bed, LCD TV and en-suite. I was hosted by colleagues from my company all week so did not have a chance to try the hotel's restaurants. I used the pool and sauna twice, and inspected the gym: all very good.Across the road (under the elevated roadway) to the right is an oasis of tranquility called the New Town Central Park where, on a nice day, you can relax as you stroll round for an hour or so. The hotel is within easy walking distance of some large shopping malls. There are taxis at the entrance to take you downtown at a reasonable rate.Staff were all very pleasant and courteous, and contributed to my very enjoyable stay. Feb 21 2018	Disappoint	Stay this hotel again at last Nov for business trip, my last stay was in mid-2015. Feel this hotel getting worse than worse! Check in at mid-night, but no greeting by check-in staff....the breakfast service is worse, also Chinese restaurant expensive but service and food far behind than before... Talk to their restaurant staff, ineresting they said the ex-food and beverage manager from Hong Kong was gone to other hotel, then the standard is dropping down. Is this excuse for the customers? I won't recommend to my friends! Jan 24 2018 	good business hotel	stay here for business purpose onlyhongqiao area is far from tourist and real shanghai areasis a new development that looks like any other western cityif first and only visit to shanghai stay at the bund areanormal clean rooms nothing fancy good buffet breakfastgubei area is near with lots of restaurants and supermarket (taxi)walking distance you hace a food street ,also new with many western choices (Mc,starb,hoot etc)if there stop in front of sheraton building and grab something from Zoes cafeteria,very good value in coffe and lunch Nov 5 2017 	Great retreat from the busy streets of Shanghai	We stayed in a club level room for six nights and this hotel made Shanghai much more enjoyable for us. As first time travelers (from the US) to China, we suffered from culture shock at times while we were in Shanghai, but it was always a pleasure to come back to the Renaissance.Our room was comfortable and fairly modern. We took advantage of the good-sized mini-fridge to store a few groceries which we had purchased from the foreigner-friendly Friendship Store across the street from the hotel.We found that having access to the club was key, as that included an easy and filling breakfast (with lots of Western style food choices) each day, and drinks throughout the day. When we did eat at the main hotel restaurant a couple times, the food was quite good but also very expensive.The service provided by the concierge was impeccable. We relied on them quite often to write our destination in Mandarin so that we could communicate with the taxi drivers. All the employees of the hotel whom we met spoke very good English.This hotel's location is a bit out of the center of the city, but it's not bad at all. We found that taxi rides to the Bund, People's Square, etc. typically took about 20-30 minutes. Great hotel; decent location; the perfect retreat from Shanghai's chaotic streets. Nov 3 2017 	Comfortable and Stylish at the Renaissance	I was here at the tail end of a 2 week business trip. The hotel is quite near our office here so a logical choice. The room was very nice - extra comfy bed (best one on the trip) with plenty of pillows.The bathroom amenities all had an Asian smell (lemongrass) which was really nice as well. The gym was pretty good - decent equipment and personal TVs at each one. The weights were ok - enough to tide me over. I agree with the other reviewer - the breakfasts were amazing -great selection of pastries - very nice - and they had the typical omelet station and Asian/Indian/Japanese on top of the Western fare.Food was a little pricey (by Shanghai standards) but not unexpected for a top end hotel. Oct 24 2017 	Very nice hotel  helpful and courteous staff but pillows were smelly of rancid	This was a good hotel. I was assigned to the wrong room with an occupant. I went back to the desk, the manager apologised but no compensation. Room was OK and neat but pillows stank with rancid sweat. I was too tired to complain and slept and left the next morning.Breakfast was OK - standard fare.A bit remote Aug 6 2017 	Excellent Hotel	I recently stayed at the Shanghai Renaissance. The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful. The room was large and well appointed. The bathroom was also roomy.The buffet served a variety of western food for both breakfast, lunch and dinner. During the evening they had a string quartet play in the lobby which was a nice touch.The concierge helped us book a tour of Shanghai. Get a personal guide it is worth the money. Jul 19 2017 	great hotel clean rooms	Very clean and modern hotel. Breakfast buffet was extensive with american and asian offerings. Hotel staff was formal and helpful. Location is not convenient to where we wanted to be, but I will definitely stay there again. Oct 16 2016 	Consistently Good hotel	Stayed recently again. Only after asking did I realise its a short walk to Intex and Shanghai Mart expo hallsExcellent service throughout from arrival to checkout. Breakfast is good and the bar pleasant. Rooms are well appointed with good beds and showers. Minor grumble about the Aircon thermostat buzzing as it switched on &amp; off. The Sushi restaurant while good is expensive so you choose and the other eteries are fine and upto the standard of many hotels.Its a bit out of town so about 1 hour by car to PVG while Hongchow [sic] is pretty close. Taxi into central ~30 rmb or 15 mins ishGood gym &amp; pool if you have time. May 4 2016 	Renaissance reflected	Just returned from a week long stay at this hotel.The food was wonderful!, especially so the bread and pasteries which were better than Paris!The breakfast buffet was excellent with western, eastern and some 'in between' dishes.The location is a bit more remote from the Bund, but the taxis are cheeep, and getting around with signs in both Mandarin and English is helpful.Shopping is not 'centralized' in Shanghai ,as the Hongquia pearl market is proximally located to the hotel.The spa is well equipted and relaxing ,with both cold &amp; hot plunge pools along with the requisite sauna &amp; steam rooms.The management, especially Robert the Food Service Manager ,were excellent in assisting with food choices both in house ,as well as the excellent surrounding Dining choices.Intend to return to Shanghai ,as well as the Renaisance Yangtze, in the not too distant future. Mar 6 2016 	shower tempurature problem	comfortable bed, good/friendly staff, small room, small bath, shower temperature changes every 1 minute, long taxi queue during commute hours (there is no public transportation around, and with its location, you pretty much have to take taxi anywhere to/from the hotel.) Jan 3 2016 	Good gym the sell is the comfy rooms.	This hotel is not in the city center but in Shanghai, cabs are so cheap that staying away from the crowd can be a wise choice. The hotel has a great gym (free), opens early at 5:30am, and the spa is pretty good. The breakfast is one of the best ones. They have Chinese, Japanese and great American breakfast food, lots of fresh pre-cut fruits for a hotel breakfast. The rooms are very nice and modern, they are not over the top and are very efficiently designed. It makes you feel like home after a few days. The Executive floor lounge has a very nice happy-hour selection of beer, wine, snacks (hot and cold)and sweets. The hotel restaurants are okay but definitely eat out if possible. Overall, 3 times of staying there have been a positive experience. Jun 7 2015	soft coccon	I have stayed here numerous times, the last time in May 2015. Always felt a sense of being cared for there. Great new pillows and comforters. The pastry shop in the lobby is great, for snacks or a simple breakfast. Slightly off location, and one side of the building is next to the freeway. Jan 4 2015	really enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance	Stayed at the hotel for 7 nights on a business trip in November '04 -- very nice environment, staff, comfortable rooms and accommodations. Had regular room service breakfast: one morning they were 10 min late, and I noted same to the manager: got complimentary breakfast the following morning, as well as a plate of fruit and chocolates. Hotel is close to shopping, other large hotels, and to Starbucks !! One down note: rush-hour taxi line is too long, both in the morning and in the evening -- plan ahead for a car.

"Sep 22 2021 	Pleasant rooms in a good location	Having read previous reviews I was very concerned that the tour group we were with had booked this hotel. They assured us it was good quality and we were relieved to find it was. The rooms were clean with modern decor - we stayed in two different rooms and both were fine. The bed was large and comfy and the bathroom had all lots of nice marble and glass. The hotel is located near a busy road but this makes for good connections with the main attractions. The only thing that was less than perfect was the breakfast area which was hectic although it did have a good range of Western and Oriental food. Jan 26 2021 	Hated the place	Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. It's got everything that could spell accommodation NIGHTMARE.We were hit with stench of some terrible odor which lasted from the hotel lobby to our room corridor.Disinterested waitress who chat amongst themselves with stale, overcooked buffet breakfast greet us in the morning.Was just sitting around hotel lobby, reading guide book bought from Sydney, got bitten by mosquitoes that hangs around hotel lobby and accused of stealing the guide book by the gift shop assistant.Many times we had to stop the maid from cleaning our room when we clearly put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door. We complained to the reception about this, then the same night , I got bitten by BED BUGS and couldn't sleep the entire night.Would avoid this place like the plague.It's a shame Australian management has stooped to such a low level! Dec 9 2018	Wonders of China Tour	Shanghai:Rendezvous Merry Hotel - &quot;Appalling.&quot;A TripAdvisor Member, Liverpool, U.K.Stayed at this hotel in the finale of a 'Wonders of China Tour.'Have been back in the U.K. for 2-weeks and we are still trying to get over food poisoning.The lobby, a vast open unappealing area, was draughty and cold.Our hotel room and bathroom, though somewhat cramped, was clean and presentable.By far the worst part of the hotel is it's restaurant. A breeding ground for bacteria. It is probably the worst hotel restaurant we have been to in any part of the world. The buffet style food is presented in large containers kept warm for hours on end by 2-candles beneath each of the containers. Many of the candles had burnt themselves out and were not replaced. At best, the food was only ever lukewarm. The thought of it still makes us shudder. The chefs (if that is what you could call them!) did not wear hats. All of the restaurant staff appeared totally disinterested. They just chatted amongst themselves.Overall, our impression is that management is poor and there needs to be root and branch overhaul of employee practices and restaurant hygeine.My wife and I will never stay at one on these chain of hotels ever again. This hotel alone spoilt our 6-week holiday to Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, and China. Apr 23 2018 	An excellent hotel	I recently stayed at this hotel for one week on a business trip to China. The hotel was booked by my company; I had no say in the matter and in fact it was not the company's first choice for my stay.No matter. I found it perfectly clean and comfortable, and it certainly lived up to its' rating. Admittedly the location is not so good from the tourist's point of view, but without wishing to seem selfish I was in China on business and not for tourism.But for those tourists who make the effort to work out the vagaries of the Shanghai underground, the nearest Metro station (Jiangsu Rd) is only about 10 - 15 mins walk away. Taxis are not too difficult to get - no more difficult than anywhere else in Shanghai.I did not dine there but I did have the buffet breakfast every day. I found this to be excellent. My only criticism was when I asked for a bag to be placed in the room so I could send some clothes to the laundry. In fact they actually took the clothes which I had left out and had them laundered, which included some I didn't want to be included - but that was hardly the crime of the century!I would certainly recomend this hotel to others and I would stay there again Jan 10 2018 	really a conference hotel	Stayed in this hotel after a long tour of china staying in a variety of hotels 3* to 5* .The Hotel is as other people have said a bit out of the way for the bund and shopping etc But taxis are easy to get and cheap.it is near the expressway but so is every hotel in shanghai ! The rooms were clean and had all the facillitys but by most hotel standards very small .Ok for one nighters but not as a base.This hotel caters mainly for conferences so is a bit impersonel but the staff were fine ane spoke better english than i spoke chinese.Food was ok i recommend the breakfast but other meals a bit motel style .The worst part was the bar .It was VERY expensive and carried a 15% surcharge on everything ! you were better off getting a taxi and going to a local bar street (Blue Frog Nanyong street 10mins away 60p fare )where most of the europeans drank .friendly atmosphere and CHEAP !!The overall view of this Hotel is that its OK but there are better about Dec 3 2017	Had to move after one night	This hotel is in the worst location, has the worst &quot;restaurants&quot; of any hotel I've stayed in, noone speaks English, and it took so long to get the smell of the hotel out of my clothes. Oct 28 2017 	Good hotel	This is a very good hotel but a little away from the &quot;action&quot;. You need a cab, bus or the metro to get to the main attractions. The staff are not really all that friendly but they are very efficient. The breakfasts are very good but don't bother eating any other meal as the service and the food are not that good.The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice for the price.They &quot;ran out&quot; of white wine (yes the entire hotel had no white wine for 2 evenings)Worth the price though. Depends on what you want. It's safe, clean and reasonably central. Jul 20 2017	Modern Hotel for A Big City	Top notch hotel geared for business travelers and tourists alike (first hotel we used in China that had an iron in the room). Clean, comfortable, well equipped. Can't say anything negative, except as a tourist, it might be helpful to stay at a hotel closer to the Bund since we were always taking taxis down to that area. We used the subway in Shanghai as well - fantastic, clean, easy to use (maps, fares), lots of posts in English. A little confusing on the street to find our way back to hotel, but we eventually made it. Breakfast top notch as well, Western and Asian buffet, good service, very minimal box breakfast if you have to leave early (not even any butter with the rolls, which were at least fresh). Mar 28 2017 	This is a MOTEL not a HOTEL!	This place calls itself a 5-star hotel, in reality, its more like a motel. The front entrance and the lobby looked modern, but the rooms are terrible. Their Chinese dinner restaurant consisted of 7 odd sized tables with almost no ventilation in a room no larger than 300 sq. feet. Since my family and I are non-smokers, the second-hand smoke we endured sure made me think of lung cancer. The driveway exiting the hotel is very dangerous, heavy with pedestrian/bicycle/scooter/vehicle traffic, each time we drove out we came close to getting into an accident. My travel agent has been notified not to recommend this hotel to others. Jan 17 2017	a really bad mistake	we booked an executive suite for 5 nights.the room was dark and uninviting.it had a vile smell.the couch and bed were so hard it was impossible to get comfortable.the food in the lounge was cold. we checked out after 1 night .reception did not as why we were checking out early so we felt that just summed up the place they obviously have enough customers so they dont need to care Dec 5 2016	Smelly room	We booked this hotel in December 2016 for five nights as part of a holiday in China but only stayed one night. Our room smelled of mould and urine. Hotel staff were competent but not overly helpful. When we asked to change rooms they gave us a key to the new room but did not offer to move our bags despite my partner having a fractured arm in a sling from a fall from a few days before. When I asked for a tourist map the receptionist laughed or rather sneered. It is an Australian run hotel with Australian prices (high for China) and Australian service standards (mediocre to poor). After inquiring about nearby restaurants to eat at and being told that there were some about twenty minutes walk away, we decided to have a meal in the hotel bar. The menu was standard Australian pub food - chips, burgers, tuna sandwiches etc. A tuna sandwich and a burger with two beers set us back 388 yuan or about $70. The hotel is next to a very busy and noisy expressway. I am not sure if it is central but it is about a 30 minute taxi ride from the Bund and Nanjing Road East which is not ideal from a tourist's point of view. It is a good place to stay if you want to watch English language television or want to converse with the many Australians who stay there but you might be better off doing that in Australia. Mar 16 2016 	Exceeded my expectations...Value for $$	Though this hotel might not be 5-stars,I am still giving an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating because for the price I paid relative to other centrally located hotels (big-chain). This was a steal. This hotel is rather centrally located and well kept. Room was clean and orderly. Though I found the bathroom a little cramp (they included both a shower and bathtub) but that was not a big deal. Bathroom amenities though rather standard were sufficient and they even had a rain shower! Truly relaxing after a long day of sightseeing etc. Hotel also provided 2 bottles of drinking water a day, which came in handy.During my 3 nights stay, I managed to get a good rate inclusive of breakfast which served to make my stay even sweeter. =) If you can, do request for a room facing the city as those views are nicer and the rooms are a tad brighter and bigger!As in most parts of China, cabs are cheap and plentiful so it was convenient getting from place to place. Will definitely consider staying here again. Mar 4 2016	Super Hotel. Great Value	What a lovely hotel this is. OK, not quite as good as the Hilton in Shanghai, but it's a chinese hotel and you really would have to split hairs to tell the differance. We only stayed 2 nights (£38 for a double room) elegant, very friendly, lovely breakfast (included in the price)very clean. Large room with Kingsize bed. Bathroom is lovely, all the extras that you would need. Extreamly central. But a taxi is only 60p within a two mile radius and the porter just calls one for you. Aug 9 2005 	Good Home Away From Home	Stayed at the Rendezvous for one night in July. Actually this was my 5th visit to this hotel. The location for me is excellent since it is near my source of business but some may find it not as convenient. The rooms are spotless, everything works and the breakfast buffet wonderful. The staff is pleasant, solicitous and very helpful. The air conditioning worked well which is an important consideration for Shanghai in July. There is plenty of traffic around the hotel but the rooms are quiet and the traffic is not heard. A good night's sleep was the result. We shall return. Nov 11 2021 	???????????????????

"Sep 15 2021	Wonderful hotel at a reasonable price	We started our Grand Circle tour at the Royalton Hotel. It was a beautiful Western style hotel with an amazing breakfast buffet. We came back through Shanghai on our own after the tour and stayed at the Royalton again. We had left some bags with them, so we wouldn't have to carry them along on the rest of the tour, and we were so glad they had this service. The breakfast buffet has everything one could desire, from Chinese breakfasts to eggs, bacon, fruit, pastries, etc. They even have an omelet station. The other restaurants at the hotel are wonderful. A bar with a short menu is available in the lobby area. The other restaurant located on the ground floor serves great food from a more continental menu. The restaurant on the second floor offers a variety of Chinese selections. We ate at all of these and never had a bad meal, but our favorite was the second floor Chinese menu. The French Concession was a short taxi ride from the hotel, and an amazing section of the city we did not see on our tour. We walked to the Bund from the French Concession, and while it is a long walk, it was such an interesting perspective of the city. We felt like we lived there. So, yes, the Royalton is a long way from the Pudong airport, but for the money and the style, we would gladly go back there. Apr 2 2021 	Average at best.	- Okey rooms. Fairly Average.- Nothing Amazing, everything was basic.- The Rain shower was nice, but the water was a bit yellow.- Room was comfortable.- Location is Far out from the City. 30 mins taxi to everything.- An Old Tesco is across the street to buy groceries- Make sure you bring a hotel card if you go out. Most taxi's don't know the hotel by name.- Lobby smells like Cigars.- The Whole hotel Smells like Cigars. Even in a non-smoking floor.- You can Hear the highway at night if you open the window.A Fairly basic hotel, i won't Recommend. Stay at the Pudong Shangri-La, Now, that was Amazing! Mar 13 2021 	hidden gem of a hotel	I stayed here for a couple of nights during a business trip. It's pretty close to the Hangquo airport. It took about 20 minutes by car from the airport to the hotel. The hotel's located in a pretty busy area, but it's tucked away from most of the hustle and bustle, which is a good and bad thing. It's good b/c the hotel was pretty quiet, it's bad b/c it took a pretty long time to catch a taxi.Food was good.The room was clean.You're able to get a room w/ a computer, but I wouldn't recommend it. I asked for a room w/ a computer, and it didn't work. A tech came up to fix it, but it still didn't work. They gave me a different room, but that room's computer worked, only after the tech came up to fix it. Nonetheless, the room was clean and comfortable. Jan 23 2021 	Nice choice for slightly off the beaten path in Shanghai	We stayed here a single night for a business trip. The location was about a 1.5 hour drive in 6PM Shanghai traffic from the Pudong Airport. The rooms were clean and with very modern styling. Many western channels are available on the TVs, plenty of English signs, and the beds were soft by Chinese standards. The hotel has several dining options, and the Chinese restaurant properly reflects the milder, fusion, Shanghai cuisine.We would definitely stay at this location again. Jul 10 2018	Great hotel soso location	The rooms were in good condition, beds comfortable. The best part was the resturant food! The breakfast buffet was great, such a variety. Staff was friendly and helpful. It is located to a huge market/store that is a good place to get snacks and things like that. One problem would be the location. Its a little congested around the hotel and a bit far from The Bund. Other than that I recommend this place. Jun 28 2018	Absolutely Fabulous	This was the first hotel we stayed in on our trip to China with Grand Circle Travel. This hotel is an amazing hotel. The rooms are top shelf (meaning great) and the service was the best I have ever experienced. I think the only part of the hotel that did not look like a million dollars was the stairwell that I walked up an down a few times for exercise one day (this was a service stairwell and guests would rarely see it unless they were crazy like me in need of a work-out). The beds were comfortable. The rooms were emasculate. The restaurants had excellent food and service. Right around the corner from the hotel is a huge Chinese supermarket from which we purchased some snacks to ease our food budget. In the mornings people from the surrounding neighborhood congregated in the court outside the market by the hotel for Tai Chi. The only thing that could make this hotel even better would be if it could be transplanted nearer the Bund or other tourist sites. However, the local color of its location more than made up for the longer drives to tourist sites. Sep 20 2017	Very good hotel	We had a very enjoyable stay in the Royalton Hotel. The room was excellent and the resturant was superb. Resturant staff did have problems understanding English when you got away from ordering the meal, but this was no problem. Location is well away from the tourist sights in Shanghai, but that may well have been a plus. There is a very good supermarket across the street (underneath a sports arena) that is very large and well stocked and very cheap by US standards. There are only Chinese resturants in the area however. Several groups were doing exercises each morning around the hotel which was interesting. Jul 6 2017 	A ""sleeper""...going local was a great experience	local friend suggested the hotel...it was great. Staff was friendly; reasonably good English; great facilities, rooms, linens and three restaurants. Almost a boutique-sized hotel, so not as impersonal as many of the chain hotels. High four star quality. General Manager grew up in France although is Chinese...management seems solid...younger staff, but then the hotel's only been open five years. Spa, night club, 3 restaurants, lobby lounge/bar. Jun 24 2017 	Nice room with very bad service	Their restaurant offered very nice food, absolutely love it. We had deluxe suite, and the room was spacious with quality furnished. The service was very bad, especially the room attendant, she was just so rude. Anyway, I think I will be back only for the yum food! Apr 3 2016 	Excellent up to date business hotel	I stayed at the Royalton for a business conference so the location was not really by choice. The Royalton is located in the western part of Shanghai, quite far away from the usual tourist sites, though the metro station is only about 15 minutes walk away. There is also a supermarket conveniently next door in the UFO shaped &quot;gymnasium&quot;. If you don't mind the location, this is an excellent, modern, high class, high rise hotel with all the amenities. The hotel ran out of their standard rooms so I got a spacious two room suite with a good view, which I have no complaints about. The room included a good breakfast buffet consisting of both western and asian food. However, internet access was an extra charge (up to RMB100 per day) so beware when comparing rates (you should be able to find several Shanghai hotels that include free internet access in their room rates). The staff were polite and had a good understanding of English. I would stay here again for business, but probably not if I were sightseeing."
"Jul 10 2021 	Good hotel	Good hotel, good price, good location.The only problem is the smell of the restaurant. Jun 1 2021 	Excellent location large rooms	The location was too good to be true. Barely a minute's walk from the West Nanjing Road metro station. We took the Maglev train from Pudong airport, changed to the metro line, got off at West Nanjing Rd station, and walked to the hotel. The same in reverse while departing. The short distance from the metro station, and the central location of the West Nanjing Rd area itself, meant far less time commuting to anywhere. This was the most important requirement as a tourist.The rooms were quite large and comfortable. There were no instructions on how to set the lock on the safe, and it took several visits of housekeeping people before even they could decipher it ! The air-conditioning was a bit on the warm side. Otherwise, found the staff very helpful, and enough people at the front desk spoke English. Exchange rate offered by the hotel for currency exchange was also good. Whenever requested, they checked out show timings, ticket availability etc for us on the phone, and helped us.The breakfast was average. My only grouse is that I had booked this place months in advance at 580 Rmb/night for 4 nights. A week before going there, I noticed that the internet quoted rates had dropped below this price. When I told the hotel about the same, and requested for a reduction, they refused (the same happened at our Hong Kong hotel, he reduced the price by much more than what we asked for).Otherwise, we found the hotel clean, and would consider staying here again. May 12 2021 	Great location average hotel	The hotel has a fabulous location just off West Nanjing Road and 50 metres to a tube line. I cannot think of a better location in Shanghai to base your trip, there are lots of restaurants nearby and the best street for shopping in Shanghai (if you are a women that is) starts 50 yards from the hotel (MaoMing Road). For this reason and the very cheap price of the hotel it is certainly worth considering especially if you plan to be out exploring the city and not spending a lot of time at the hotel. The hotel is okay the rooms are clean but slightly worn out, ours had a few marks on the walls and the towels were a bit worse for wear etc but it passed my wife's bed linen and toilet inspection so it must have been clean. We had a large room with sofa and desk. The airconditioning was poor it was really just a fan system which was not great at night when the room became quite stuffy.The staff were okay but didn't speak great English. The breakfast was poor, to the point that on 3 of the 5 mornings we opted to go out to the excellent cafes just outside the hotel and pay for breakfast. I wouldn't worry too much about this as a good breakfast from the bakery across from the hotel can be had for a couple of pounds. The lobby is small and there are no amenities apart from a small business centre with cheap internet access.Overall the hotel is okay, but it has the advantage of being very cheap compared to most Shanghai hotels and has a wonderful location. Arrange transport in advance if arriving by train, as it is impossible to get a taxi and most car won't know the hotel or street. May 4 2021 	Stay here if its only a bed you want for the night	I booked a triple room and found two 1 1/2 size beds when we arrived so we requested another bed which we had done this in other hotels previously. As this bed took up too much space we asked for it to be removed and good job we did because it was at an additional cost but I was told this after 2 nights even though it was booked as a triple room! We were only informed of this because we were annoyed with the staff again because the room was booked as a triple including breakfast but we were only given breakfast vouchers for 2 people and told to pay extra if the third person wanted it! So be careful as you may book one thing but not get it and be charged extra for things without them informing you. Also the staff are not friendly or helpful and speak very little English and the restaurant waitresses speak no English at all!! The lobby constantly smelt like sewage for the 4 days I was there. The room was a good size though but the bathroom was the size of a small en-suite. The location is good very close to Nanjing Road. This hotel is good for someone who only wants a place to sleep and is not fussed about the service they get as it is not a very good one. Apr 25 2021 	OK place beware of some things	Great location (line 2 door 4) on nice walking street with plenty of shopping, clean, and room good value. Close to all the high end shoppes. However beware the following: The hotel is on master air condition system. You are only hot if the management says you are hot. The interior rooms (no windows) have no A/C and are extremely stuffy when A/C is off, quite uncomfortable. Also... breakfast included is quite lousy food, just greasy fatty stuff and overall poor quality, not worth eating in my opinion, even for free. For the $$ ((about 460 RMB) a great location and OK place, internet worked great and was included. Apr 24 2021 	If only the toilet flushed...	This hotel would get rave reviews from me and my husband if it wasnt for the toilet situation. Let me preempt that by saying that a working toilet is essential to us when we stay in a hotel - if that wasnt important, we would have just gone to a campsite.They put us in this &quot;matrimonial room&quot; and the toilet didnt flush. We stayed a total of 4 nights in the hotel and after the 2nd night, we asked to change rooms and they were able to give us a new room, which was great. The toilet in this room flushed slowly but it did its job but it did stop working on our last day there. But we were already leaving so we didnt bother complaining about it. They have issues with their plumbing for sure. This was in November 2018 so they might have fixed it by now.There were a lot of good things about this hotel. Breakfast was nice and hearty; we were a hop and a skip away from a subway stop and surrounded by little restaurants and mall and fast food places. The staff were pretty accomodating and friendly, and our hotel rate was pretty cheap - around 50 USD a night. So like I said, this would be a stellar hotel if it wasnt for the toilet. Mar 24 2021 	Good hotel but ask yourself what's more important--proximity to metro or comfortable bed?	POSITIVES: very convenient/close to MTR, nice location, cleanNEGATIVES: most excruciatingly uncomfortable and hard bed I have ever slept on, somewhat thin walls, slow internet accessBOTTOM LINE: good for 1 night stay if you are extremely tired, so close to public transport, and good fried dumplings near Yang's Oct 21 2018	Ruitai is a hem	Initially, I wanted to stay somewhere close to the Bund. I am so pleased that I didn't; the Bund is dirty and crawling with people.I booked the Ruitai because it was situated close to the West Nanjing metro stop on line 2 (it's just around the corner to the left), which is just two stops from the East Nanjing metro stop, the closest to the Bund, and one stop from People's Square, the main interchange for lines 1 and 8. From W Nanjing to E Nanjing costs 3 Yuan.The hotel is starting to show signs of age, scuffed furniture and slightly marked carpet; however, the rooms are large and very spacious (I booked a deluxe room for USD80 breakfast included). As is to be expected in Chinese hotels, the bed is firm plus but is super king sized. Staff are both friendly and helpful.The bathroom is fully equipped with toiletries and a shower over bath. There is also a small fridge in which to stash your food and drink. And on the subject of drink, if you're a wine drinker, Marks and Spencer have opened up a store on W Nanjing Road just around the corner from the Ruitai - walk out of the hotel, turn right into Taixing Rd and then right again into Nanjing Road, walk about 200m and there is M&amp;S. In the food department they have a small offering of well-priced wines. As for food, turn left out of the hotel and head to the end of the mall – Starbucks is one of the last stores on your left. Cross Shimen #1 Rd and continue down Wujiang Lu until you see on the left hand side the yellow sign of Yangs. There are two, go to the one furtherest away. Here you can get the best fried pork dumplings in all of Shanghai. Go to the cashier and tell her how many you want, pay then join the queue. As a guide, four are more than ample for dinner and at 4 Yuan total, that’s cheap eating.Shen’s Restaurant on the second level of the hotel is so so but cheap. If you don’t speak Mandarin, they will find an English speaking person to guide you through the menu. I had some kind of chicken hotpot with rice and a 500ml bottle of beer for 49Yuan. Downside, the chicken was laden with bones.All in all, great location and more than adequate lodgings. Apr 17 2018 	Wonderful and Convenient	We weren't too sure what to expect of the hotel based on the extremely cheap rate posted and some mixed reviews we read. However, we went in open minded and were extremely pleased with our experience. We arrived at the hotel after a long train ride from Beijing. After lugging our bags through the Shanghai train station and a couple minor detours, we found ourselves at the exit of the West Nanjing Road subway stop. There was some construction going on so it was a little difficult trying to figure out where the hotel was. Once we found a street sign we were on our way and about one short block later we were at the hotel.The staff was extremely friendly and spoke much more English than others we had encountered on our trip. We arrived at 8am (long before check-out) and the staff was more than willing to help us out. They checked us in in advance, let us eat breakfast in the hotel (it was included with the room) and stored our luggage while we explored the city. When we returned to the hotel that afternoon, we were told we could go to our room and it was MUCH nicer than anticipated.The king sized bed was probably one of the cleaner, more inviting beds I've ever seen in a hotel (at least in hotels within this price range) and the size of the room was pretty overwhelming. We had a huge TV, plenty of room to run around (not that we were running around) and a sitting area with a desk, chair, armchair AND ottoman! Another perk -- we opened the shades and realized we were in a corner room with a huge wall of windows! Granted, it wasn't the best view (who really enjoys a view of a city alley anyway), but it was something.The bathroom was immaculate and we had complimentary bottles of water and some nifty disposable slippers. Everything was clean and the staff was very prompt in their services. We called the front desk one day about laundry service and almost immediately after hanging up the phone, someone was at our door waiting to take the bag.One thing I found a bit odd...we left the room one night for about an hour around 6 or so to get food. We came back and the bed was made and our breakfast vouchers were on the nightstand. A bit creepy, but we weren't missing anything. The jury's still out on whether or not this was a good or bad thing. One thing I must add: each room has a little LED display outside that says whether or not you are in the room (you have to keep your key in a slot in order to power anything in the room). So maybe the staff was just being nice? Jul 28 2007 	Good location I would recommend it	I booked the Ruitai Jingan hotel because of its location: close to the city center (a 15 minute walk takes you to the People's Square and Shanghai Museum), and extremely close to a subway station (with very good connections to all destinations in Shanghai: I really recommend using the subway). I had the impression that I received good value for my money: a nice and large room, a clean hotel, and a staff that answered the (few) questions I had. Breakfast, which was included in the room price, was very good: a wide choice of (hot) items, a salad bar, and bread with marmelade was available. The only disadvantage I had was the location of my room (not a city view), but I didn't really mind that since I was only on my room to sleep. Jul 19 2007 	Very dated and tires	This hotel was part of a package sorted out by our toour operator as a part of an organised &quot;China Excursion&quot; package. This was by far the worst hotel I have stayed in for a very long time. The hotel is nice looking from the outside and when all said and done the rooms were large tidy &amp; comfortable (except for the mosquito's). The view over a stagnent river wasn't so hot. We had booked a &quot;superior&quot; room and were given a basic room because they were decorating the superior rooms. That I could have accepted but the staff didn't tell us we weren't getting what we booked. One of the reception staff demanded a deposit before we were even welcomed to the hotel and manners seem few and far between. Our representative who picked us up for a tour the following morning even said that this hotel was so far out they didn't normally pick people up there ..... in fact when we finally obtained a map from reception the hotel wasn't even on it. The buffet breakfast was ok but served in a &quot;ballroom&quot; that had seen better days. Down a sweeping staircase only to find that the carpet and table cloths were frayed. The service was so so when the staff could be bothered to stop chatting to each other and assist guests. The piped music in the halls that seemed to start at stupid o'clock was only ever the BeeGee's or Abba and I would liken this hotel to a 1970's throwback. The hotel information stated that there was a safety deposit box in every room .... this is NOT the case and you would have to use reception. The outside areas were tidy and clean but positionally it was too far away from &quot;anything&quot; to be a consideration for our next visit.The staff badly need some customer training and how to smile would be top of my wish list. Jun 2 2007 	Good location	Stayed for 3 nights in May 2007 at Ruitai Hotel in Shanghai. The location was excellent, just across the subway station and very close to the west part of Nanjing street. We payed 80 USD/ room/night including tax and breakfast.The room we got was very big and had a wonderful king sized bed. Large windows, nice furniture and complimentary mineral water daily.Just two minuses: the first one - opposite the hotel there was a huge building in construction and it was pretty noisy from 6 AM to 7 PM and the second one - toilet was broken, having water running on the bathroom floor. As long as we stayed there it was not repaired, the cleaning lady just putting a towel to absorb the water.Breakfast was ok, having both Chinese and western food. Reception staff speaks English.As the second minus was just our bad luck, I recommend the hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice location in the centre. You can get easily to/from Pudong airport there using the Maglev train and then the subway no. 2 (West Nanjing / Shimen Rd station). Apr 24 2007 	Great location great hotel	Great hotel in a very handy location in the city centre - right next to Metro station and so very easy to get about to all the sights. Room was amazing - huge with big bed - and very good value, we paid about £38 per night for the room. Breakfast was included in the tarif and there was a good selection of both Chinese and Western food. Staff were friendly and helpful. Feb 22 2007 	Good location but I expect more from a Ritz Carlton	I chose this hotel because I like Ritz Carltons, and to be near my business travel appointment.The room was fine enough - spacious with traditional/Asian furnishing, excellent housekeeping, etc. that you expect from a Ritz.. I get a little annoyed when a hotel at this price charges for internet access.I usually look forward to at least one meal in the Dining Room signature restaurant whenever I stay at a RC, but this one was a disappointment. The food was good enough, but my experiences at other RC's were more impressive. At these prices, I'd like to be impressed, not just satisfied.The public rooms are fine enough, but felt a little more corporate and austere than I prefer.The take-away: there's not much to complain about, but I'd prefer staying at the nearby Pudong Shangri-La. The guest rooms are a little nicer at the Ritz, but I prefer the ambiance of the Shangri-La and will return there on my upcoming visit back to Shanghai. Feb 6 2007 	Pleasantly Surprised - central and convenient	We were looking for a hotel to stay in that was conveniently located near a subway station, as our plan was to head to Pudong Airport by train in the morning. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a higher class room than our reservation was originally made for. This was a pleasant surprise. Our room was wonderful and clean, large with huge windows that overlooked Nanjing Lu (though somewhat noisy, yet typical for this area). The rooms had complimentary water, free wired internet access, and you received a free hot breakfast (generally a combination of Chinese and western fare). Staff even spoke English (though limited) which was great.Outside, you don't have to walk more than a block to get to the subway station on the #2 line. This is one stop west of the People's Park Station. You will find many food/drink options from Starbucks to local street fare in the shopping alley outside the hotel. Fun shopping in these alleyways! Plus, Nanjing Lu is just outside the hotel, and you have all of your more upscale shops along this road, if that's what you prefer. The Portman is only about 2 blocks away. I suppose we had such a pleasant experience because we were not expecting much, and received much more than we anticiapted. Regardless, this hotel was a great find for the location, and we are definitely returning in the future. Dec 9 2006 	A great hotel	Stayed for 7 nights - hotel is in great location on the No 2 subway line (Shi Men Rd stop (now known as West Nanjing) is only two minutes walk away)Street market from 1400-2100 in the mall outside the hotel.Had a room on level 7 (11 floors) - king size bed - nice and firm.Shampoo, soap, bath foam, tooth brushes &amp; bottled water provided - and replaced each day.Ate breakfast in the hotel each morning - full buffet with plenty of choice.Used internet service which is situated on level 11 - 5 RBM for 15 mins.Currency exchange at front desk - same rate as at bank. But be aware that no exchange is offered on Sunday. Aug 12 2021 	Excellente suprise! Jul 13 2021 	??? May 4 2021 	Es mejor dormir en el suelo que en la cama"
"Nov 25 2021 	Value for money	At only 468 RMB this is a super hotel with big, clean rooms and great service.The breakfast and dinner choice is huge and quality can't be better.A metro station close by makes up for the somewhat out of centre position. Nov 14 2021 	Awesome hotel!	Two nights here at the end of a marathon business trip to Hong Kong and China. First timer to Shanghai as well. This hotel is about one year old, and owned by the Want Want snack company- their logo of a funny looking kid is all over everything. All of the drinks and snacks in the room are their product and therefore free. Room was huge- American King bed, desk and chair, sofa and coffeetable, large wardrobe, bath slippers and robes, sunken garden tub, fridge, free broadband (wired). Had room service one night, cheap and quick! Desk staff were excellent and I was overall very, very impressed by the hotel. Note that it it primarily used by business travellers and it is an inexpensive, but lengthy, taxi ride into the proper city centre. Public transport links I understand are excellent but I did not get a chance to use them. There is a 24 hour tiny grocer, alldays, just around the corner, but did not seem to be too much else as far as dining and shopping nearby. But again dining in the hotel was cheap and delicious. Breakfast buffet was very large and international, and included in the room rate. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Mar 13 2021 	Elegant with a twist...	This is an absolutely first-rate hotel is every respect. The staff was everywhere, offering to be helpful. I had a problem with the Internet access in my room, and someone appeared with a new cable within seconds after I hung up the phone to report it. The room was impeccably clean. The only weird touch: it's apparently owned by a snack-food company, whose mascot adorns everything... a little like a Disney character, but not quite as cute. I can't speak to the location (it was convenient to the Expo center, which is what I was interested in) but it is next to a metro station, and the Shanghai metro is as nice a system as I've seen. The restaurant was quite good. Nov 24 2018 	Best for Mandarin speakers	This hotel is clean and spacious, the staff are friendly and helpful and they do a good buffet in the evenings for 120 renminbi. That's the good news. The hotel caters chiefly for chinese tourists and business people, it's located well out of the city centre with no metro link so it's a taxi or a couple of bus rides into town. The staff are helpful but have very limited english so communication was an issue. If you're new to China , like me, you migt be better spending a little more and staying more centrally. Aug 6 2016 	What a rat hole	I totally agree with the last review. All I can say is if you decide to go to China, do not stay in anything less than a 5 star. I thought a three star would be our equivalent to a Motel 6 - no way. The A/C did not work well, bathrooms always had mildew and the carpets in the dining area were so dirty, I could only imagine what the cooking area looked like. This hotel needs a major overall. The bedding was clean and they always try to make you happy but I have a problem with dirty walls, carpets and chairs. Shanghai is a great metro place and we were in a hotel at the end of the city where there was very little to walk to. Try to get something close to the Bund. Jul 26 2016	Not a 3 star hotel	Just returned from a tour of China and ended our tour staying at the Qianhe Hotel. Not a good experience! Carpet was so dirty and stained both in the rooms and in the halls that we were almsot afraid to walk on it. Rooms were woren and furniture frayed. Advertised bar was a counter in the coffee shop. Only one of the two advertised resteraunts existed and the advertised shops were a shelf in the computer room! We ate breakfast in a dirty old banquet room and when I asked that the empty coffee carafe be refilled I was told &quot;No&quot;. The breakfasts were the worst of our tour. We were told we could cash travellers checks which they would not do until our tour guide intervened. Do not stay at this hotel unless you are really looking for cheap. It is inexpensive but I would advise spending a few more dollars and staying at a hotel where you don't have to be concerned about what might be in the carpet!"
"Oct 18 2021 	Great hotel for short/long term stay	Stayed at the Eversunshine hotel for 10 days during my business trip in October. We stayed on the 13th floor Duplex apartment and i will stay there again when next time in Shanghai.Rooms were very clean and all furniture and equipment was brand new. Bathroom was a highlight for me, especially the shower. On the main floor we had a fridge and stove and microwave. Neither of those got used during the stay, although i did store some fruits which were purchased in at the fruit stand around the hotel (next to Domino's Pizza ). Our room didn't include internet access so had to pay 40RMB ($6) extra per day for it.I think the hotel has a great location in Pudong area. You have a bank right in the building (another one across the road), several restaurants within couple minutes walking (there is a good one across the road in the building that says TF COFFEE), forgot the name of it, but great food and prices are very fair. Subway is not to far, about 12 minutes walking to Line 4 subway or 15 min walk to Line 2. Only problem i had with hotel is having taxi drivers find it, i always had to give directions (or more like point my way, since i haven't met a single cab driver who spoke English) Oct 9 2021 	Better for long term stays than for one or two nights.	This is a hotel meant for someone that probably needs a place to stay for more than a few nights. If you're a tourist, then you're better off on the other side of the river where most all of the touristy sights are.The rooms have two floors, with a very steep slippery staircase to the bathroom and bedroom on the second floor. The staff at the desk are NOT very attentive or courteous communicating with the guests.On the other side of the coin, the rooms are clean, new, and nice, and there are coffee shops, restaurants, and large shopping malls (Times Square) within a few minutes on foot. The buffet breakfast was decent enough. Given the alternatives for a quick stay in Pudong the price, room, and amenities were satisfactory. Jul 21 2021 	Great Hotel with good outlook	Great Hotel with good outlook over Pudong. Duplex Suites with bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Free internet in Business Centre. Lovely breakfasts included with great selection. Nice kitchenette but no utensils to cook/prepare any foods. I had a knife sent up to the room for which I had to sign a docket to either return before departure or be charged for it. Good location - only 5-10 minute walk to main shopping area, 15 minutes to Subway. Close to City (only about 20.00-25.00 RMB to the City in a Taxi). Friendly staff. We had a great view looking over the Pudong area towards the Shopping area and the Towers. Jun 29 2021 	Value for money	Stayed at the suite room,with 2 big n a small room.Lounge.Very neat n comfortable.Buffet breakfast provided.Surrounding shops at this area had been given a facelift probably becos of the coming EXPO.Really recommend this hotel for value customers. Mar 31 2021 	Nice hotel in the Pu Dong Area	I stayed at Shanghai Ever Sunshine Hotel for four nights and found it very good. The suites are two floors with the bedrooms at the second floor. Nice friendly staff, The only little problem with this hotel is the location. It's a little bit off and you have to walk for about 15.-20 minutes to the nearest metrostation. But as taxi is very cheap in Shanghai you can get a taxi insted!"
"Aug 13 2021 	ok but nothing special	We stayed here at the end of a tour around China arriving in the early hours after being delayed due to the weather. At check in the staff were rather uncommunicative and after giving us our room didn't even point us in the direction of the lift let alone assist us with where to find our room or help us with our luggage. Rooms were clean and adequately equipped but nothing to write home about and more like a fairly low quality 3* hotel than the 4* it is advertised as. Breakfast was ok with a reasonable range of options but not of a comparable standard to other 4* hotels I have stayed in across Asia.Fine for a night or two as a base in Shanghai but i am sure there are better options around. Jul 16 2021 	Ok rooms location not that great	Stayed for 2 nights. Rooms were not that big. Small bathroom. Overall ok, but I think that you could find better, closer to sightseeing and shopping.Breakfast was not too good. Not much of an option, so the second day we had breakfast elsewhere.Try the HAPPY FEET massage/reflexology clinic in the alley next to the supermarket. Jan 13 2018	A Vast Improvement...	I have stayed at dozens of different hotels in Shanghai and across China, and have stayed at The Shanghai Hotel several times over the past few years.Before the hotel had some irritations for me - minor, but they were there. The staff had previously seemed cold and aloof; the breakfast was mediocre and if I had a problem then the staff's English seemed to disappear.This hotel is one of several in Shanghai managed by Shanghai Jin Jiang International (Group) Company Limited, and has been for some years. Now I am personally convinced that there has been a change of management in this company, and that international management has been brought in.My reasons for saying this are twofold: one, the standard of printed English in the new hotel literature in the rooms is exemplary, the best I have ever seen in China and as far as I am concerned is wordperfect. Second, the transformation in the standard of the hotel is huge. The staff are helpful and pleasant, the duty manager especially went out of his way to help a member of my group who left a cash card in the atm at reception. The breakfast is great, and there are far fewer bored and disinterested staff shuffling about trying to find something to do.I also noticed on this visit to Shanghai that the Peace Hotel, also managed by the same group, has now been closed - not before time! I look forward to it being refurbished and reopening 'under new management'!The Shanghai Hotel has also revamped and improved its business centre, and also had signs pointing to a swiming pool (although I didn't visit this).Also, the improvements here have not resulted in a massive price hike - not yet anyway. Nov 18 2017	overall good hotel.	Location was not the greatest, but taxis are cheap. We tried to walk back from the Pu Dong but ended up getting a taxi.Breakfast was nice.Rooms looked a bit tired &amp; bathroom floor stained.Luggage took ages to come up &amp; when i tried to get it off the trolley myself the porters insisted on delivering it themselves. Oct 5 2017	Not Too Bad	I stayed at this hotel for three days with a group of high school students at the start of our China Tour. The rooms were OK, though the beds in some rooms were a little hard, it was a lottery as to whether you got a soft bed or a hard bed. I shared a triple room with two other teachers and it was very crowded, but that was to be expected. The breakfasts were quite good - we were served in the Level 1 restaurant which was nicer and less crowded than the ground floor restaurant. Staff were efficient but not overly friendly. Not all staff spoke enough English to communicate our needs but again, we got by. Some of the students ranked this their favourite hotel. Sep 30 2017	A great start to our China Trip	This was the start of our 2 week Page &amp; Moy trip. We were very pleasantly surprised at the standard of the hotel. Staff were very curteous and efficient. Ground floor bar and snack bar was very good (just be aware that if you order a sandwich, it comes with chips and is very filling).The most impressive thing was the breakfast - everything you could want in both western and chinese, even japanese sushi. Would certainly recommend this hotel. Sep 29 2017	Rooms are OK service not so brilliant	Stayed here for 3 nights in Sept 07 as part of a tour of Eastern China. The room was comfortable enough with good facilities, but the service left a lot to be desired. Staff at front of house were rather aloof, the bar was a bit of sad lonely place and the mixed drinks not very inspiring. We had a group meal in the hotel one night, and it was awful - as if they were making no effort for a bunch of tourists. Aug 7 2017	Very welcoming and comfotable.	I stayed in the Shanghai hotel for work purposes in February/March 2017 and I thought it was really nice. The hotel rooms are well decorated, have air conditioning and heating, tv with various channels including sky news and music channels. The hotel lobby is stunning, large and bright, and has a cosy little bar (which serves very nice red wine). I dined in the executive breakfast room most mornings which had plenty on offer (free, and buffet style including bacon, sausage, cereal, toast, coffee). It also had a beautiful view of the Shanghai skyline. I will return to Shanghai again and each time I do I will use this hotel again, I cannot fault it. Jul 23 2017 	A descent hotel at a descent price	The location of the hotel is not the best for a tourist on a tight schedule, though the taxi fares in Shanghai is fairly cheap, averaging RMB 17 one way within the city (RMB7.5= U.S.$1). Our friday stay was U.S.$80. Same type of hotel at tourist areas can cost at least $50 or more. The hotel is between end of 3 star to beginning of 4 star with clean beds &amp; bathroom, descently decorated room and lobby, restaurants and gift shops. Their service is pretty well rounded, from laundry service, cell phone charging to currency exchange. Most of the check in/out staffs are friendly except some of the managers standing in the lobby having a very cold look. If you stay less than 2 days in Shanghai, I recommend pay a little more and stay at Nanjing Road which is more centrally located. Otherwise, you can see a lot of local cultures as soon as you walk out of this hotel. There are local small shops, bars &amp; restaurants, convenient stores which are all of good qualities and services. Jul 16 2017 	Not the Best in Shanghai	My wife and l spent four nights in this Hotel, prior to embarking on a organised tour of China. I approached the Hotel a little apprehensive after viewing many comments on Trip Advisor.It was certainly not a four star Hotel as purported in the Travel Brochures, and would rate at the bottom end of three star.Be that as it may, our accomodation was clean. The location of the hotel is near the subway, but more importantly it is in a location that allows you to wander the streets and see many of the real faces of China. There are plenty of small shops nearby and a large supermarket within one km..Whilst l found the reception staff quite unpleasant, all other staff were approachable and where possible helpful. For a Hotel that has significant foreign tourism, there is indeed a lack of English language support available within the Hotel.Breakfast was indeed satisfactory, although there are two locations and there seemed continual confusion into which dining room we should attend. My tip is just be polite and direct and they will agree with you.The Laundry service here was indeed cheap and excellent. Jun 10 2017	Very good location	We stayed six nights at the Shagnhai Hotel on Wulumugi Bei Lu as part of our 14 days group tour of China in May from Alberta, Canada. We had a room on the 14th floor. This hotel is located in a busy district of Shanghai across from the biggest hospital in Shanghai. From our room we could hear the traffic and car honks early in the morning. The hotel rooms were small, and yet the hotel had met our travel expectations: clean room, clean bathroom, hot shower, and working air conditioning. The quality of the Western and Chinese buffet breakfast was average. The hotel is within walking distance to many local shops, an upscale mall, a subway station, and restaurants including Pizza Hut. Taxi fare is cheap in China. We took the taxi to visit the new Pudong commercial district overlooking the Bund and the Shanghai Museum. The most we paid on taxi fare was 26 RMB, which was less than $4.00 Canadian. If you like Chinese arts, culture, and history, the Shanghai Museum is a must see. The entrance fee is 20 RMB, which is less than $3.00 Canadian, a great bargain. The museum also has a great gift shop. If you are looking good local restaurants in Shanghai, visit Canglefang on #333 Changle Road for Shanghai food, Dongbeiren on Shan Shee South Road for Northern Chinese food and the waitresses will sing Chinese folk songs at your table, and Paulaner Brauhaus Shanghai at Riverside Promenade overlooking the Bund, Binjiang Dadao in Pudong for very good German cuisines, burgers, fries, and clubhouse sandwiches. May 7 2017 	Very short stay	The hotel was booked as part of a package deal. We were in a twin room for 2 nights. We didn't use all the hotel's facilities as we were out visiting sites most of the time. Buffet breakfasts were a great start to the days sight seeing. May 5 2017	OK but nothing special	We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. It is ok, but nothing special. We only paid 85$ a night, so it is a fair price for that hotel. You will enjoy Shanghai, a very nice town.Two negative things: First, we had to wait very long to get checked in, second, the internet was definately not high speed.Would come again Mar 6 2017	Very good hotel near Jing'An Subway stop	We stayed at this hotel 4 times in the past 6 months, and each time had a great stay. It appears to cater to Asian and European tourists and business people, so you will see almost no North Americans. The hotel rooms - at least in our experience - meet US standards. The rooms are well decorated with all the amenities, the furniture is well-styled and well-maintained (except in one room where it was pretty scratched), Cable TV works well, the mini bar is well-stocked, etc. The lobby is a bit spartan, altho there are some gift shops. You won't get any phone calls asking if you want a &quot;massage&quot; as you would at some other Chinese hotels, but you will usually see some &quot;ladies&quot; standing discreetly in the shopping arcade entrance at night. The hotel has a business services office with Internet - use it if you must, but there is an internet gaming center about a block from the Jing An subway stop that offers 1 hour of internet access for the equivalent of US$1. This hotel is conveniently located from an Italian restaurant and coffee shop called Vero Moda, a traditional tea shop called Sophie's, and a very good restaurant called A Future Perfect. If you're making reservations while you're in China, use elong.net ( a partner of Expedia) to get the best rates. Dec 7 2006 	OK but not great	The rooms themselves are pretty nice and the bed is very comfortable. I disagree with the previous reviewer though who said the location is good - it's about a 10mins walk and 5 stops on the subway to the Bund or over 30mins in a taxi due to the everpresent rush-hour. There are many more hotels much closer to the centre. The level of English at reception was very poor which you would not expect in a 4-star in Shanghai. The gym is a real disgrace - one treadmill, one bike and a few dumbells in the middle of a hallway outside the business centre - if queuing for everything with no A/C and a load of bored businessmen watching you is your idea of fun then this is the gym for you! Finally breakfast is pitched very much at the Asian traveller with soggy, warm toast adn undercooked eggs the choice for the westerner. Oct 18 2006	The Shanghai Hotel was my home for three weeks...	I stayed in the Shanghai Hotel for 19 days while visiting friends there. I enjoyed my stay there including the free American Breakfast. The location is excellent for commuting to many parts of the central city..Staff was cordial and well dressed and helpful to me. The room was clean and well maintained by our porter. I highly recommend the hotel.Ron Lewis Dec 10 2005	OK Accommodation but good location	Hotel is really old but location is good. Neighborhood has all that you need. The only &quot;ding&quot; in our room is that the shower [--] - water is REALLY weak. Other than that, clean and comfy hotel. We paid about US$80 per night and was told that it's a good deal for the quality and location. Oct 6 2005	Loved Shanghai	We stayed at the Shanghai hotel for 3 nights at the start of our tour with Page &amp; Moy. The hotel staff were numerous and friendly and the only problem, if you could call it that, was when we came to change travellers cheques. The hotel has a policy of ringing the bank to clear acceptance of travellers cheques and on 2 occasions it took about 20 minutes to do this even though they were Thomas Cook cheques and we had our passports with us. Obviously they have been stung by fakes in the past but we wished we had just taken cash with us instead of cheques as recommended by the tour company. This was the only hotel where this happened - elsewhere no problem. The rooms were large and clean. The furnishings had seen better days but were acceptable. The location is not that far from city centre but taxi needed to get there as crossing roads is an impossibility with thousands of bikes, mopeds and 4 lanes of cars in each direction. There was a lovely Italian restaurant about 200 yards away which made a nice contrast to Chinese food twice a day! The restaurant tended to be crowded at breakfast time as many people with tour companies leaving early on days out. There was a good selection of western items at breakfast including egg, bacon, toast, fruit, fruit juice, cereals and yoghurt. Do not miss Shanghai at night and the 'tunnel' ride under the river - Fantastic!! A real highlight. Nov 3 2021 	Hotel correcto Oct 31 2021 	?????????????????? Aug 17 2021 	????????????????????? Jul 7 2021 	??????? May 7 2021 	Ottimo Hotel in zona centrale al giusto prezzo Mar 30 2021 	????????????????????? Mar 15 2021 	???????? Feb 16 2021 	?????? Feb 5 2021 	????????? Sep 18 2018 	??????"
"Oct 26 2021	A great Introduction to China!	My family of 4 stayed at this hotel at the beginning of our 2 week holiday as part of a small group tour. Hubby &amp; I stayed in a double room that was quite small, our teenage children shared a twin room that was much larger. At the time, we all found the beds to be very hard, but further into our holiday we realised that this was nothing compared to beds in other hotels!Breakfast was a mixture of western hot food/toasts (but not much in the way of cereals) &amp; interesting local foods. The mushrooms particularly were delicious. TIP for westerners who like their cup of tea/coffee bring your own bags &amp; little sachets of UHT (long life) milk to make a cuppa in your room. Milk is usually powdered in China &amp; generally hard to come by. The tea served at breakfast was very weak &amp; the coffee almost undrinkable!There is an ATM in the hotel lobby.The surrounding neighbourhood was safe to explore at night, just a few blocks from impressive department stores with lots of interesting local stores/streets/alley ways on the way. Oct 28 2018 	Great value good hotel	Having previously stayed in Shanghai at the Oriental a few times , a chinese friend suggsted I try this hotel.I was assured it would be OK. It was more than OK, I thought it was great value for the price paid and was upto a good four star standard. I did book the larger room and it was worth the extra $40US per night. I saw some of the smaller rooms and they did look small. I found the room and its furnishings to be of a good standard and the room to be very clean.Check in was easy and most staff spoke good english. The breakfast was quite satisfactory and I found the food and level of service to be of a good standard. Staff were available to answer my questions and provide helpful advise about local restaurants and how to get around, always enquiring if they could do anything else to help.It was located near the financial centre and in easy walking distance to Nathan Rd and the embassies. As always, cabs being so cheap, making getting around out of peak traffic times easy. A cab from the hotel to the Maglev train airport connection cost 40RMB. The only drawback I saw was a 10 minute walk to the underground, but then walking around Shanghai is always interesting.If you are after a good hotel with quite acceptable facilities and location, this is the pace. Hotel rates for some hotels in Shanghai can be high but I found this hotel be of a good standard and a very good price. I will return to this hotel on my next visit to Shanghai. If you are on business and want a clean and comfortable place to stay, this is it. May 20 2017 	Good hotel	I went to that hotel a bit afraid after reading the only review available at the Net, but the result was a a nice surprise,I travel a lot, mainly on business and although the Shaanxi cannont compare with international chains it was quite good, so was the price. I would rate this hotel in the medium range of the 4 stars type.Many different rooms to chose, if you want to upgrade from the basic for a moderate additional, slighty noisy at night with the motorway by. Beds are a bit hard, but after a day walking in the city, you don´t mind. The service was superb, always helpful with directions and checking that you wouldnt forget anything in the taxi. Some delays checking out. Food average, could be improved with some occidental food, but you are in China after all.Located 10 minutes front the center of the city, the fare would cost just above the minimun 11 RMB (1 euro), and 155 from Pudong airport.I would repeat this hotel next time I head for Shanghai. May 3 2017 	Who needs anything else	I've worked all over the Far East and stayed in some very nice hotels. So it was important to me that the only review I could fine on this hotel was accurate, which I have to say it's not! I found the Shaanxi to be a fine hotel, OK it’s not draped in the opulence some people might be used to nor is it practically good looking compared to others. But the service is excellent, advice on where to go, what to see and how to get places is second to none.Rooms are exposed to noisy traffic, but show me somewhere in Shanghai that isn’t!If I had one criticism it would be the 3rd floor restaurant, the food at my table was not that good, and a little overpriced. But again I ask the question, what the hell are you doing sitting in a hotel restaurant when there are so many other fabulous places to see and eat in Shanghai.Although the TV’s in the rooms are mainly for the Chinese (only one American channel – CNN) its spacious, clean, new and everything works, including the mini-bar fridge!!The beds are quite hard, which suited me but may not for others who prefer something a little softer! Nice décor and matching colour schemes are also important to me, and I was not disappointed.All in all a very nice hotel, with staff who are prepared to do anything for you, even make you a hot sandwich at 04:00 in the morning, simply would not happen in the UK. You will not be disappointed with your stay here, nor the bill at the end of your stay. Happy Travels! Mar 20 2016 	Basic basic basic	Traveling with two Chinese colleagues, one from Hong Kong and one from Taiwan, we stayed here for three nights. Room sizes varied widely. One was tiny, one medium and one was huge. The hotel seemed new and things were still pretty fresh. Even though a newer hotel, the carpet was showing the wear of past occupants.If you stay here you might want a room on the back side of the hotel. All the rooms on the front are almost literally on the freeway.The windows do what they can to shut out the noise, but its a major freeway. Even my colleagues were not enchanted with the breakfast buffet and were ready to hit the streets looking for some place else for breakfast or dim sum after the first day. The buffet was expensive for what was offered.This is the place if you need a clean room and the basics. It offers little in the way of charm or personality.The staff was helpful and there were English speakers on the staff in most areas. Taxis are readily available. I'd look for more interesting options for the same price that are a better value next time I am in Shanghai."
"Sep 7 2021 	a genuine 5 star hotel	My husband and I took advantage of their weekend rate, we stayed last Friday- Sunday and it was a good conclusion to our trip in Shanghai after we had an unpleasant stay at another hotel. We have been to many high class hotels and this is one of them, beautiful decor and quality furnitures throughout. Food was good and staff generally helpful and spoke good English which is an exception in China. Overall we were very happy with the Sheraton. Jul 31 2021 	Need to do more to keep up to the Brand Name	Sheraton is a brand who's tag line is 'belong'. Being a SPG platinum member, I have stayed in quite a few Sheraton's. All my colleague's advice me to stay at the renaissance next door which I heed to till date. But in a fit of fury i decided to stay at the Sheraton. Lobby: Good expansive lobby. Bit old. but functional. Service in the lobby was quick and I was escorted to my room( which was changed a day later due to maintenance work.)Rooms: Had what you may call a suite - a big room separated by a partition. First thing when one goes into a hotel room would notice is the smell. If the room smells good it would probably be pleasant. But it was Bad here. Did not expect this from Sheraton. I suppose it is do with the AC and the rains. The service is also pathetic. They tend to neglect basic things like replacing the toiletries. The bed was also not upto the mark. The housekeeping never even bothered to clean the carpet once in my stay i suppose as a small spill of peanuts which i made on the first day was there till i left. Room service never responded with a smile. Internet was one of the worst which i had seen at a sheraton..Overall I would say this hotel really needs to do a lot of work to change the outlook as well as how it looks inside. Checked out of the hotel and moved to the Renaissance even though its a bit expensive. Jun 18 2021 	a truly fabulous hotel with top notch service	The hotel is not located in the middle of downtown but you can travel to all the major spots via metered cab ( the doorman is on standby there to get one for you esp. during rush hours, about 15 mins ) or take the metro ( 10 mins walking distance to the station and maximum 10 mins to downtown ). Two biggest exhibition centers are situated right next to the hotel – if you are traveling for any exhibitions, which will be perfect for you.Usually I don’t like to eat in the hotel’s restaurant, but since they offer some free drinks during that time, I tried the Italian restaurant on 27th floor, it turned out to be an impressive experience. The female Italian chef just arrived in town not long time and she exactly knows what she is doing and the food tastes awesome and you can have an excellent view of the city. I also had my business lunch on the 2nd floor’s Japanese restaurant, the service is again awesome and humble. The waitresses are running in the restaurant and just get what you want in a minute although it is pretty busy. The breakfast buffet again is fantastic, but if you don’t have enough time to eat there – they have a ‘grab and go’ counter right in the lobby, coffee and fresh bakeries. I really have to mention that the deli on the 2nd floor offers the most extensive selection of home made meat items – just like what I can find in Frankfurt, and lots of fresh pastries. I was told that this is the best bakery in Shanghai from one of the frequent guests I bumped into. Generally speaking, the staff is all courteous and the service is professional and humble, the front office girl wearing traditional Chinese qipao are very friendly and helpful and have a good knowledge of city happenings. The hotel room is very warm and cozy to me, it has an ‘East meets West‘ style which are very distinguished from other new hotels. The Sheraton’s signature sweet sleeper beds are very soft / fluffy and comfortable – I usually bring my own travel pillow but in here, I can sleep very well. The gym on the 5th floor has all the imported machines. If you have spare time, can also try the lovely Spa next to it.Another thing is the GM of the hotels sit in the lobby every morning during hotel’s rush hour, so if you have any problem, he is very approachable and willing to help. This is truly different from other hotels where you can never solve your problems because you can’t find the right person / decision makers.Last but not least, it is a worthy 5-star hotel and you’ve gotta try it. Jun 5 2021 	A SPECIAL LOCATION	About location. This hotel is not in the centre, to the centre 15-30 minutes by taxi (about 50-70 RMB). The district is a special business district for foreigners (with girls also). There are expensive shops for local buyers, restaurants, but you have not a choice, like in the centre of city, where you can walk, go to 1000 of restaurants and see Shanghai life. The hotel. Nice, big hall. But...small rooms, WiFi is not complimentary (it is a racket!), small territory - no tennis court, no walking place, no garden (there is a garden - like a room). FOOD - at the top flour there is an Italian restaurant - expensive but not tasty! (There is a wine collection). Ground flour restaurant can make a poison - you shall not died but you shall think so. For this - the hotel is very expensive, I think.Good trip everybody!!! Apr 20 2021 	Excellent hotel	Excellent well appointed rooms with good location next to the exhibition centre Mar 30 2021 	Exactly as expected from a Sheraton hotel	Its always nice to come to a city to which you have never travelled before and feel home in a comfortable place.I have stayed at a few Sheratons before, so I knew roughly what to expect from the hotel.LOCATION:The location was perfect for me, it was not on the Bund or downtown, but more to the west side of the city. There is a Starbucks/McDonalds within 5 minutes walking distance and plenty of Chinese and other Asian restaurants around.The drive from the International airport to the hotel was about 45 minutes.CHECK IN:Smooth, professional, got the non-smoking room I requested for. Check in was quick at 17h00.ROOM:I believe I had a standard room. Nothing fancy, but a good bed. Big flatscreen with CNN and a handful of other international channels. No seperate shower (always a petty). The minibar was well stocked.BREAKFAST:Plenty of space, plenty of choice. Various Cheeses, sausages, juices, breads, etc, etc. Not the most choise Ive ever had, but again plenty of hotels I stayed in with less choice.OVERALL:A good hotel to stay if you can not afford time to get settled in a local/boutique hotel. At this hotel you know what you get and you will get it. The price you always pay with the big brand hotel is that there is very little charisma/character Mar 12 2021 	Terrific rooms and great breakfast	I do not understand the negative reviews that this hotel received.I received free accommodation and breakfast as I won a competition, so I am trying to be careful that this does not overly bias my review.The lobby has two large chandeliers. Checkin was smooth with four clerks handling arivals, though I gather that occupancy was down to 60 per cent.Our 15th floor room and the accompanying hallway appeared to have been recently renovated, as had the business centre, fitness centre and admittedly small indorr swimming pool.The room was exceptionally quiet and presumably double-glazed even though it backed onto a freeway or tollway that seemed to only carry cars and motorcycles/ scotters (no noisy trucks were viewed).Beds were comfortable; the room had excellent lighting and a modern plasma television, as well as a large writing desk and trendy chair.Two complimentary bottles of tap water were provided each day, as were lotion, shampoo, conditioner and a reasonable range of teas plus plunger coffee.The bathroom had a modern glass bowl as its basin: I could not work out how to lower the plug. The bath was a reasonable size and again new, with a good sup-ply of hot water evident. There were six lights in the bathroom including one uplight, which gives some idea of the good standard of illumination.The wardrobe was a reasonable size. Breakfast on the ground floor was excellent: the only notable omissions were mango juice and cooked tomato (raw tomato was available). Everything else from breads, yoghurts, cold cuts, hot dishes and even dried mango, walnuts and cashews to place on one's cereal was available, as was the 'egg station' with two chefs to cook to order.As usual in this type of hotel, Internet through the business centre was extortionate at CNY7.5 for the first ten minutes then CNY1 per two minutes thereafter.The only other thing I found strange was that the mens' facilities near the swimming pool and fitness centre lacked showers: of course, one is able to walk up to one's room and shower. Dec 17 2008 	Far Far Away	Firstly i would say, Ok hotel with a very far away from almost everything. But still easy to reach if you land@Hongqiao airport. I would suggest anyone have to leave for this airport or train station(south terminal) Otherwise forget about it. IT to Far Away! Bellman and concierge very helpful. Subway is 4 block away 10 mins walk. Nothing much to see around except one shopping mall names ParkSon. Hotel is right next to Renaissance hotels. Reception also nice and helpful. Club lounge is ok but nothing to mention it. Check out process is super slow due to unprofessional staff i guess. Room ok, if you got suite pls. not take the one that similar like connecting room. Try to get room digit follow by XX01 only. that make your suite more space. Main restaurant is ok, buffet also fine. Atmosphere also fine as regular old fashion Sheraton. Only one problem so far, that Housekeeping did not do their job properly. Till night before checkout i desire to report to Duty manager. So in the morning Assistant front office manager promptly get back to me with a fantastic manner and result. I am really sincerely appreciate. Nov 1 2008 	OK but there are much better hotels for the money	The Sheraton at Hongqiao is ok, and i didn't have some of the problems that previous reviewers encountered (esp the overbearing staff in the lobby, or having to pay for phone bookings via the concierge). The building is quite old and in some parts that really shows (e.g. bathrooms) At some point relatively recently they have tried to freshen the hotel up &amp; have updated the fit-out of the rooms. The location is lousy... a long way west of the city. Fine if you have a reason to stay this far west, but otherwise, you would NEVER choose to be this far away from the centre. The rooms are basic but fine. The furniture is dark wood &amp; old-fashioned but style aside, it does the job. Like other reviewers, I found the bed to be rock hard - uncomfortably so (and i like a hard bed). The air conditioning worked fine. The bathroom was a mix of new &amp; old. The shower had one of the oldest mixer taps i have ever seen, though the wash-basin and bathroom storage shelves were much newer glass (although showing scratches &amp; signs of age).The breakfast buffet was ok (incl in the room rate), although it was some of the worst coffee i have ever tasted. I didn't buy any other food or drinks from the hotel (so can't comment on other reviewers comments of high prices).All in all, it's a typical older Sheraton in a terrible location... and in Shanghai where there are so many other hotels, you really wouldn't choose to stay here. Sep 4 2008	Very average business hotel	For the rate charged (around 1400 RMB), this is by no means a cheap alternative by Shanghai standards. The hotel staff hardly speaks English and the ones that do frequently misunderstood our orders. The room is alright, but nothing more.Beware of room service and restaurant prices, a complete rip-off and the quality of the food (at least at their Italian restaurant) is appalling. Paid over 800 RMB for a two course meal with a glass of champagne. The starter was borderline uneatable, the main course was overdone and the potatoes/sauce tasted very poor. The champagne (at 180 RMB per glass!) was poured up from an already opened bottle that was simmered and the carbon oxide nonexistent. Tasted really bad, and the waiter even tried getting away with a half full glass.The lobby is spacious but with teared seating - skip the food there and head somewhere else if you want an enjoyable dining experience.Would not recommend this hotel if a better alternative is on the table. Aug 19 2008 	Sunday Brunch	I didn't stay, just had Brunch there with friends and wanted to let others know about the GREAT value for money: For RMB 238 they serve literally hundreds of hot and cold dishes, from oysters to lobster to Sashimi, breakfast dishes, lunch dishes hot and cold, desserts....fantastic. In my view the best deal in town. There is also free-flow Sparkling Wine, beer and soft drinks.They have a Filippino Jazz trio entertaining from start to finish.Service is great, staff is friendly and (most) speak English :-) Jan 26 2008 	Very average for a Sheraton	Stayed for work for a week. Hotel staff are all friendly and courteous. Ran meetings in the ball room for a week, function rooms are quite good. Food however is very sub par and expensive. Breakfast buffet is very expensive for what you get. Function package we had for morning/afternoon tea and lunch was horrible. Same bad food every day. Business center is also expensive for printing. Wouldn't really recommend it. Jan 23 2008 	Excellent Business Hotel	Stay in this hotel for 2 days in Jan 2008. Things I like: The hotel is new, room is well equiped. The staffs are well trained, courteous and very helpful. I felt the overall services is great and well ahead of most hotel in China. Things I dislike: Except for the below average breakfast and the pricey rate, there is no other weak link that I can pick on. However, maybe due to the focus to cater for bussiness traveller, everything seen so &quot;by the book&quot; that it lack the surprise element to really leave an impression.I will recommend the hotel to those who have to be in Shangahi because the job call for but not to those who are there for holiday. Dec 27 2007 	Superb blend of east and west	I spent 6 nights here on business. I was on the Starwood Preferred Guests Floor which was 19th out of 26. I can't speak for other floors, but my room was spacious, comfortable and thoroughly immaculate. Bathroom was completely new and modern. Seating and desk area was comfortable. The hotel in general is opulent and well staffed. It has wonderful Chinese styling so you don't feel like you are at home, but don't feel out of place either. There are attendants everywhere ready to help. It is a major ex pat hotel so English is pervasive. No language difficulties. They cater to English speakers and greatly helped directing taxi drivers and making reservations. I thought the room was reasonably priced, but everything else is way overpriced by local standards. Breakfast is near $30! Mini-bar items were twice what I'd expect even in NYC. This is surprising considering there were numerous local and more reasonable options available nearby. The PROS - right off of the highway makes it easy access for taxis. It is near a number of high-end department stores and numerous restaurants (including Starbucks for morning coffee and McD when you just need a french-fry fix.). Area is Westernized so you'll feel plenty comfortable exploring.The CONS - it is outside central loop, a good 20+ minutes to the Bund, and longer to Pudong. Area is Westernized so it lacks a local flavor. Not much by way of cheap local shops, most stores are higher priced (but not necessarily higher quality). It's a 15min walk to the nearest subway station so taxis are required, but they're cheap! Dec 20 2007 	Overall good but little mixed	I stayed in one of the Club Rooms recently.Unfortunately, they could not give me a non smoking room, so had a smoking room, on promise 'it would not smell'. Admittedly, it did not - it was fine. However, the floor outside smelt like an ashtray! Very unpleasant everytime I walked to/from my room.The service overall was fine - if a little variable. Example in the Club room where most of the staff were prepared to help with anything - booking restaurants, booking taxis, recommending restaurants etc. However one of them (inexperienced possibly?) simply said (very nicely) to go to the concierge on the ground floor. not much help!Rooms were fine - average for a Sheraton, nothing special but clean, spacious &amp; comfortable, with Internet access, decent TV etc. as expected nowadays. Dec 7 2007 	oriental oppulence	a top class hotel in the gube area which has a lot of western expats and therefore a lot of mixed restaurants in the district. This hotel offers everthing the discerning traveler would want, lovely foyer bar and restaurants, probably a touch out of the way but everything else makes up for this slight inconvenience Apr 30 2007	Shanghai'd in Shanghai	This is one of the worse run hotels I have been at in a long time. Typical Sheraton style - a lot of grandeur, but horrible service, facilities and overall experience. Food is god awful. No matter where you go or what you do in the hotel, it will cost you $$$. Ever hear of a $12 1.5 liter bottle of water? How about a $20 pizza? Better yet, $70 for coffee for four. I should have had the meeting at Starbucks.Outdated room decors, where fitted sheets seem to be unknown to the cleaning staff. Bathroom decor needs to be updated and more functional. Location is one of the hardest to get to in Shanghai. Unless you have a lot of money to spend for nothing, this is not a hotel for a business traveller. Nov 22 2006 	OK but...	Like other contributors, this hotel is a mixed bag.The ground floor-lobby,bars,lounge is a mess. There are plenty of staff waiting to 'help', but there is an overbearing sensation. The piano keeps playing ad nauseum- it must drive the staff insane!Bedroom OK but smallish, staff polite, drinks too expensive, good breakfasts. Nov 6 2006 	I will never stay here again	I stayed at the Sheraton Grand in Shanghai during a recent 3 week trip which included the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, the St. Regis in Beijing, the Red Capital Ranch at the Great Wall, the Peninsula in Hong Kong, and the JW Marriott in Shanghai.Our group's experience at the Sheraton was not good. As a Sheraton Grand property, I expected a hotel comparable to the others. The management of the Sheraton should visit these other properties to learn how to properly run a luxury hotel.Our first problem occured upon our arrival at the airport. We used the Sheraton's airport sedan service for our transfer from the airport to the hotel. The Sheraton touts that they use BMW sedans for this service. Yes, a BMW was provided, but when all the luggage would not fit in the trunk, the driver refused to put one of the carryon bags on the front passenger seat. We were forced to wait while a different vehicle was obtained. The driver of the Mercedes sedan at the Park Hyatt and the driver of the Rolls Royce at the Peninsula had no problem with placing a bag on the front seat.My room at the Sheraton was a suite on the club/executive floor. The suite was somewhat small, but adequate. However, there were so many unnecessary pieces of furniture and decorations in the room that it seemed tiny. The breakfast offering in the club lounge was marginal.The hotel attitude is definitely &quot;off&quot; for a luxury hotel. Five of us wanted to sit the lobby lounge while we waited for another member of our group to arrive. We sat down and 3 of the 5 ordered drinks, but 2 decided not to order anything. The waitress then informed us that everyone in the group must order something. Those not ordering are not allowed to sit in the lounge. Keep in mind tha there is not anywhere else to sit in the lobby while waiting.In the couple of days that we were at the Sheraton, there were a few similar occurances. For such a short stay we were amazed how many times our behavior conflicted with their rules. We decided to check out early and transfer the the JW Marriott (which we found to be an excellent hotel).There are signs placed around the hotel prohibiting various things. The feel is more of a military camp than a 5 star hotel.I believe these problems are probably due to management's reliance on strict enforcement of some rules, the results of which have not been fully considered. Overall, the staff was friendly and efficient, but they had to enforce &quot;the rules&quot;.During previous trips to Shanghai, I have stayed at the Jin Jiang (the old Jin Jiang, but in the new wing) and the Intercontinental. I would recommend both of these over the Sheraton and I would pick the JW Marriott as my first choice.The Sheraton property itself is very nice and convenient to conducting business on the West side of town, but this does not make up for the negatives. Sep 16 2006 	mixed feelings	I have been staying 4 nights in the club executive room and I have some mixed feeling about everything, but this may possibly be said also for other chinese properties .Hotel is nicely kept though not young ,rooms are in a traditional american style (not mine definitely) bathrooms are small and a little be oldstyled .Equipments in the room is satisfying,beds confortable ,airconditioning so and so.Club room quite small and without toilets , so after the first two drinks you will need to go back to your room.Staff friendly in the chinese way (they say no more often than in any other country worldwide but probably that's how they are trained...you cannot leave your brifecase to the concierge if it contains a laptop !!! they charge you for tickets reconfirmation and restaurant boookings) .Prices of drinks in hotel is ridicolous with a beer or glass of wine close to 10 euros .Location also not primary , you are 30 minutes away from the bund without restaurants or interesting shopping malls nearby.Food at hotel is acceptable - over average if you go to the Italian restaurant.After having spent three weeks in other asian countries probably I got spoiled and the attitude found at this hotel was somehow confusing Feb 25 2006	Great Hotel although a little overbearing	This hotel is amazing. It definately deserves the five stars. I've stayed at plenty of Sheratons before but this one has got to be the best. The rooms were not only spacious but very very comfortable. Of course, that may be a reason why you chose Sheraton with their well known Heavenly bedsheets. The service is definately remarkable, botht the Concierge and other staff. There are literally 6-7 people greeting you when you enter the hotel, check in, etc... When you return to the hotel with even one tiny little bag, the staff will get it for you and bring it to your room. I've never had that service in the US, not even at W-Hotel. This may sound a bit overbearing, but hey you're getting the price you paid for. Would you rather have this service or some crappy service and room? As for the food, we didn't try the restaurants because there were so many choices outside of the hotel. The only bad thing about the hotel is that its not in the downtown area. But still, its only about $21 RMB ($3 USD) to take the taxi to the Pudong area (Downtown). I would most definately return to this Sheraton if I'm ever in Shanghai again. Jan 3 2006	Over-bearing over-attentive staff.	This is a very grand-looking hotel with a lobby full of chandeliers, sculptures and marble. Got a room as a Gold Preferred Guest, it was very modern but not fully comfortable. When you first check in, Housekeeping would leave 2 rubber ducks by the tub and a teddy bear (and yes, a stuffed animal)on the bed that all have tags that say &quot;take me home.&quot; This could seem a little spooky as the first impression of the hotel room. And if you put the teddy bear away, it would reappear on the same spot night after night. The entire staff was very nice and polite, but no doubt they are all overly attentive and can be over-bearing at times. When you walk in and out, at least over 5 people say &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;good evening&quot; to you at the same time, and when you leave the restaurants, some of them would even put the jacket on for you. The hotel bar was just so-so, and the breakfast was okay. Room service was terrible. Gym was big but the equipment choices were very scattered (different treadmills, bikes, weights, etc.).All in all, stay there for the grandness and don't expect comfort of a hotel like home. Aug 30 2005 	nice hotel bad location	The hotel is most definently a five star hotel, but there is one problem.The location of the hotel is realy bad! I went outside for a walk, and there is almost nothing to see! Also, I went about five minutes and about twenty people came over to me to ask me to buy something(watches,food,massage) It was not very comfortable.Regarding the rooms, I stayed in a regular room and it was just gorgeous!The furniture that the room provides was outstanding! If you are there on business then this is for sure a room for you! The service was also very good as the people in the hotel are very nice! Overall, the hotel is worth the stay but the location is not good like other hotels in Shanghai! Nov 10 2004 	Poor service of a Concierge staff	I stayed at the Sheraton Grand Tai Ping Yang for two nights in end October. The staff are generally friendly and helpful apart from one concierge staff.On the first day, the concierge staff, Wilfred have kindly made few restaurant reservations for me. However, on the second day, when I asked another concierge staff, Franklin to make further reservation, he refused by lying that his telephone can only connect internal lines. I then queried why the staff can do so the previous day. He then asked my room no. and advised the phone charge will be billed to my room. I also queried why this was not requested the day before. He then even asked me to make the reservation myself and stated it is just a phone call! After much argument, he finally agreed to make the reservation but with much reluctance. I was really astonished with such a rude service provided by a Concierge from a 5 star hotel! I am a regular business traveller but have never encounterd such a poor service from any hotels in China or the Far East. I will not consider staying at this hotel again as the quality of staff is so inconsistent. Aug 31 2004	Almost Like Being Home	Arrived late on a Friday from the US. Greeted by any surrounding staff as entering the Hotel and escorted to the front desk. Service was more attentitive than the parent Westin hotels are in the States. Stayed in a Club room and surroundings were quiet and very comfortable allowing a much needed sleep. Closet was well equipped with at a dozen hangers of differnt types, small safe, extra pillow (in case 5 on the bed weren't enough), an iron and full size ironing board. Bathroom had tub/shower, glass bowl sik and vanity, soaps, gels, lotion and shampoo, nail kit, shoe cloth, combs, toothbrush, sewing kit, most anything you might need and a couple of rubber ducks. Main room had a large flat screen lcd TV, bed, desk and chair, high speed internet connection (extra fee), sitting chair with coffee table, dressers and end tables. I'd guess it was about 400 sq. ft. Controls for HVAC were mounted on the wall easy to find and set. Had to unplug something to plug in the iron but it didn't mess up the full room light, fan &amp; tv controller that sits bedside.Drank and ate barfood in the first floor bar. It was western style food and looked and tasted as espected, good but not great. Had pants dry cleaned and pressed without difficulty.Rate paid was 1488 RMB ($180) plus 15% service fee, remember that tipping is not necessary since the Hotel adds it. Might be steep for a Sheraton in many US places but this was more like a Westin, it was once badged as a Westin.Returned twice more for a night each during a week of travels around the area and looked forward to returning each time.

"Total chaos I want my money back.	Not something you would expect from a hotel branded with the &quot;Sheraton&quot; logo.Its either they are still on their way to getting up to what international travelers expect of the Sheraton, or management really doesn't care.Below are the reasons why I couldn't recommend anyone to stay at the Sheraton Pudong. - ArrivalAs I arrived at the Sheraton Complex, my driver made a mistake and took me to the &quot;Four Points by Sheraton&quot; instead of the Sheraton Pudong. The porter at the Four Points was attentive, opened my door and was quick to service. I told him I was staying at the Sheraton Pudong, he kindly directed the taxi to the correct driveway.To my surprise, the Porter at the Sheraton Pudon was too busy chatting with his colleague, I had to flag him down so that he could help me with my bags. When I asked him if this was the Sheraton Pudong, he replied &quot;I don't speak English&quot;- Check-inThe lady at the check-in counter was either having a bad day or Chinese customs is to be cold to arriving customers. No smiles or thank you's were given. A very dry check-in. She did not even explain where the porter took my bags and who/where I was supposed to ask to get it delivered to my room until I asked her about it.- RoomThe rooms were decorated in a very nice matter. However, the details of the room finish were not what I expected. A lot of things were bolted/glued on crooked (like the faucet and the showerhead); it got me worrying about the construction of the building it self. However, housekeeping and other services were up to standards except the fact that when people come to deliver things to your room, (I guess since they do not speak English) they just grunt and hand you what is supposed to be delivered.- BreakfastService is HORRIBLE. First day, I was served a GLASS of hot tea, when others were given mugs. Not is that only weird but also dangerous!! Second day, someone gave away my seat while I was at the buffet. It took the restaurant forever to find me a seat, clear the table (which they only half cleaned). I had plates in my hand, no one offered to help me while I was waiting for a seat to be made. - Check outI used the in-room internet (for a fee). However, at check out they told me that no charges were on the room... nice that I didn't have to pay for it but, worries me that the reverse could happen. - Bell serviceI was advised to reserve a taxi since I was leaving at a busy time in the morning (9:00AM). The morning I was leaving, the bell desk/ concierge was so busy that no one was available to help me to retrieve my reservation. I decided to walk to the curb and ask the porter for the taxi that I reserved. The porter just asked for a room number (he has no documents to check if I was the correct person), then he asks where I was headed.... I had already given all details of my destination when I made my reservation. I bet that no reservation information was relayed to the porter and that I was just lucky that I didn't have to wait for a taxi. The verdict: the building it self is nice but expect motel 6 style hospitality. I stayed at the Intercontinental Pudong last year and had a waaaaaaay better experience. I recommend staying there instead if you are heading for Pudong. Sheraton, you really need to work on that hotel. Its a venue with a world class name and building but with negative service. If you're like this now, whats going to happen during the Expo?? Nov 7 2021 	Good quality hotel	Very good quality hotel. large room, good service, good breakfast. Just a DVD reader missing and it would be perfect. Oct 22 2021 	Nice but I wouldn't choose again...	Arriving in Shanghai today our group of 7 took a taxi to the Four Points by Sheraton where we had reserved 5 rooms. Upon arrival we were told that there were no rooms available. I was very surprised because we had our confirmation papers with us.The Four Points staff told us that they would put us in the Sheraton Hotel nearby. We walked to the hotel and started to check-in. I was then informed that there were no rooms with king sized beds available. As I am particular about my bed due to back issues, I had reserved a king sized bed. Through some discussion I was placed in a smoking room (25th floor) with double beds. The room was very adequate with a nice view (but small window), but the beds were small.After 4 &quot;back-n-forth&quot; phone calls I was given a room with a king bed (12 floor). However, take a look at the view (in the photo). I get to look at another hotel directly out my window. Do not book this hotel expecting a nice view... even if you ask for it (as I did).One thing that I really look for in a 5-star hotel is a super bed experience... I like to sleep well and expect the best, plush beds... this Sheraton doesn't have great beds.It is only my first day here and the room is decent. The check-in problems were frustrating as I was on a timeline for completing some work in the afternoon. I am hopeful my experience from this point will improve. So far I would suggest considering another hotel.Other comments:* No wireless internet access* Very limited snack options in minibar* There is a French Press in the room for making coffee (this is terrific!)* In-room dining choices are limited and may only be for a very specific/limited palate: Goose liver??? Mushroom &amp; Jelly Fish sald??? Oct 12 2021 	Wonderful	We very much enjoyed our stay of 4 days here. The breakfast &quot;buffet&quot; has to be seen to be believed. Various stations offer Japanese, Chinese cuisine, an egg station, juices, quality breads and jams, fruit galore etc.etc. offering a great start to the day. We lucked into incredible rates for our stay but they are probaly VERY competitive for a hotel of this class - it is a Sheraton class hotel as opposed to Chinese class/designed/constructed hotel with a western branded management. Of great benefit is the metro stop being right at the door of the hotel - so although the hotel is off the beaten tourist track, the subway makes it accessible to anywhere very conveniently - and it is nice at night to land at your doorstep. Oct 6 2021 	Be careful startwood points not rewarded	I would like to start by saying the hotel isexcellent and the service is 1st class.This the third time I have stayed there on my business trip to Shanghai. My complaint is that I am a starwood member, and so for each stay one is awarded points depending on the amount for final bill is.On this visit I booked two rooms on the internet vai what Sheraton customers services would call a third party. This was because this time when I was doing my booking I found the rate offered by Sheraton own site were much higher than when I booked through an agent.  So obviously I went for the cheaper option.  I paid $1200 for my stay with them , however I was informed when I complained about not reciving the points with the excuse that I had not booked directly with them so was not entiled to recieving points. So be aware that is you do not book directly with Sheraton you do not get your points. So to gets points you have to pay there inflated prices.When I travel with Emirates as long I fly with them they give there own points , they do not look at who have I booked with, However the Sheraton loylalty shceme does not do this.They have best rate guarantee,the complint procedure in complicated , once you do find a room you have to fill in complaints form.If there own website rate were not inflated in the first place, customers would not need to bother explaining to them.  I Aug 14 2021 	Will definitely come back again.	Booked 3 rooms, stayed 4 nights in late-July, can't be more pleased. Many previous reviews mentioned inconvenient location; now subway line 4 is completed with a stop right in front of the hotel. Shanghai has 8 subway lines now, it can take you to almost anywhere in the city within 30 minutes for only CNY4. Taxi is also cheap, under CNY30 (USD4.5) to most PuXi areas, CNY15 and less than 10 min. to Pudong Pearl Tower.For the hotel, it's at the high-end of a 5-star hotel. Room is spacious 42sqm with 2 'queen' size beds, rare in Shanghai. Pool, fitness, breakfast are all excellent. What's better, you pay a lot less than most 5-star hotels in Shanghai. The hotel is very close to 2010 Shanghai EXPO. Will definitely come back agin. Highly recommend. Aug 1 2021 	Perfect	I'll come again awesome  Perfect Jul 15 2021 	Good Value for Money	We stayed at Sheraton Pudong for 4 nights back in February. This was the second time staying at the hotel. Similar to other reviews, we could not find anything wrong with the hotel. The room was spacious and comfortable and had everything you need. We tried both the coffee shop and the Chinese restaurant, both were OK. The location is very close to the airport train station. All in all, this is good value for money and we have no complaints on any aspects of the hotel. Jul 8 2021 	Great hotel with comfortable rooms in non centralised location for tourists yet ideal for business travelers	Stayed here for 6 nights in May with my parent in a twin room. The bed was very comfortable and room size was huge and spacious. Previously stayed at the Four Points next to it and realised that Sheraton has bigger rooms, bathrooms and better facilities. If price is your consideration factor, Four Points offer more value for money.Sheraton has a gigantic bathroom with separate toilet, shower, and sink area. The shower has a bathtub and a separate shower feature with a rain shower facet on the ceiling. Very nice touch. I also like how the closet has doors that can be opened from both the room and the bathroom, very convenient as one does not have to bring the clothes into the bathroom.Facilities wise, the health club is great. Pool was nice, and fitness centre was also above average. Free internet kiosk and printing available at lobby area. Highly convenient and helpful for people needing to print stuffs.Food wise, My mum and I had a few meals at the Chinese restaurant and we found it affordable with excellent food selection and offering tasty dishes. Also ordered room service once and found it to be good and affordable with wide and decent selection.Restaurants are very helpful as the hotel location is not very ideal. Taxi is cheap, though, and one will most likely be taking the cab frequently when you stay here. There is a subway station directly in front of the hotel and offers a cheap and efficient way to get to the touristy area over the river in Huang Pu. I had to take the train once as no cabs were willing to drive me into Xintiandi for a dinner appointment I had. The train ride was fast and despite having to change line twice(!) I reached Xintiandi under 30 minutes.If you are a business traveler and need to frequent Pudong, then this hotel will be great for you as cab into Pudong is under 10 minutes and will not set you more than 15 Chinese Yuan (around US$2). May 24 2021 	top notch hotel	Just took a quick 3-day getaway trip to Shanghai, and chose this hotel as part of the air-and-stay package. My first 2 choices were sold out so I had to &quot;settle&quot; for this hotel. I guess it's not a popular hotel because of its location (on the Pudong side, and not walkable to TV &quot;Oriental Pearl&quot; tower).The location may not be perfect for some, but the hotel is right on top of the subway station. It takes less than 45 mins to get from the Pudong airport using the Maglev highspeed train and subway (side note: the frenquency of the subway can be quite low during weekend, about every 15 mins). And the city is covered by multiple subway lines (up to 8 now). As a last resort, taxi is very affordable.What impresses me the most is the well appointed guest room. Everything you need, they have it. The rain shower is a nice touch that is not often found in others. TV with lots of channels, nice bedding, separate toilet stall, I just cannot find any faults. However, I must caution about something I found in many hotels in China. For some reasons, the materials used in renovation/furnishing get worn out pretty quickly (I already found little cracks in the stone tiles in the bathroom), so rooms may not be as impressive in a couple years.Used their gym as well, very spacious. It's set up in a long corridor style room, most equipment facing the garden, so it gives guests a very tranquil feeling while exercising. I took a peak at the pool and locker room area (which has a steam room), all very nice. And for some reasons, only few people used the facilities (I went around 6:30-7:00am), so that's great.As part of the package, the breakfast buffet is included. Lots of items to choose from. Particularly enjoyed their pastry and cold section (cereal, salad). Great service throughout, I was able to leisurely enjoy the food, while browsing the internet (free on the ground floor of the hotel).Overall service standards are very high, any inquiries and problems were answered/solved promptly. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. May 17 2021 	Don't drink the water	Room very good but prices for drinks and services a rip off.RMB 78 (GBP 7.50) for a bottle of water, RMB 50 for an hour on the Internet &amp; RMB 60 for a tomato juice.This is China. Does the management expect you to haggle as you have to with the other pirates in Pudong. Feb 24 2021 	No Complaints	Very nice new hotel. Free internet access in lobby for your own laptop, plus they had 6 desktops (link@sheraton which is a great thing) free for use.Breakfast was included in my rate, and was good and ample.The hotel, and the Four Points next to it, are located in front of the Tang Qiao metro stop, line 4. The metro costs 4RMB per ride. To get to the maglev station, go to Long Yand Rd station on line 2. You have to change trains at Century Avenue, but it's easy enough. The maglev is 50RMB each way, or 80RMB roundtrip within 7 days. The maglev ride is 8 minutes, plus about 20-25 minutes on the metro to/from the hotel stop.The hotel is not in the heart of Pudong where the big buildings are, but it's all a metro ride away. Dec 14 2008 	Very nice hotel	Stayed at Sheraton Pudong for 3 nights on business trip in December 2008. As a business hotel it was very good with free wireless internet in the lobby. Room internet was overpriced as it is in every upscale hotel (I never understand this).The breakfast buffet was varied and food tasted great. Dim Sum station also included.One complaint was the lobby bar was very impersonal and had a very abandoned feel. The hotel tries to spruce it up with live music but not a very good result. Dec 12 2008 	Great hotel!	My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Pudong in Shanghai in November 2008. The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located near a subway entrance.After a very long day of travel with our patience running low and attitudes about to take a turn for the worst, we were incredibly happy to check into our beautiful, comfortable room. I have stayed at many great hotels, but this may be one of the nicest - we actually took out our cameras and took a few photos before unpacking because it was soooooo nice. It was a really welcome surprise that changed our mood immediately.New, spacious room with an incredibly comfortable bed, chaise, lovely bathroom, fluffy robes, nice amenities. Perfect.The buffet breakfast downstairs is one of the nicest I have ever had. It became my favorite meal of the day. Dec 2 2008 	Great modern part of China.	The hotel was very nice and the staff are helpful. Location was great, and it was walking distance to the train. It was not too far from the main attractions, just a 15-20 min cab ride. The room was comfortable. Cleanliness is not a problem. Staffs are helpful. The bed is just right, you can have a good night sleep at night. It was a good stay. Oct 23 2008 	Just about a pass mark	Stayed in Sheraton Pudong for three nights whilst on business to Shanghai. The hotel is about a year old and in good order.Quibbles about usual things really. Shanghai is expensive but food and drinks in this establishment do not represent good value. (Check the back of the restaurant menu and you will find set meals for 90 RMB, but no staff member will point this out)Concerned also about the cost of internet access in the rooms although this is provided free of charge in the lobby area.SPG rewards and upgrade entitlement the usual mystery with the 3 points for every $ spent simply not being credited.Location is ok next to the cheap and cheerful four points sister hotel and less expensive shopping mall which has several cheaper food outlets. And as usual in Shanghai you are only a short hair raising taxi journey away from venues on both sides of the big river... The Bund remains building site as things gear up for Expo infrastructure requirements so best avoided for now.I would stay here again, as its clean, quiet and a relative short hop in taxi from PVG via Maglev station at Longyuan. Aug 14 2008	Wow!	Wow, this hotel far exceeded my expectation. The service was impeccable. The best I've experienced in China.I am surprised at the comments about the &quot;bad location&quot;. The location isn't &quot;bad&quot;. It's in Pudong, the business district, away from the tourist spots. But the subway stop is literally on the hotel plaza. In general, the subway in Shanghai is the way to go around the city because of the traffic. By subway, it's 15 - 20 minutes to downtown Shanghai, and it's really convenient to the Pudong airport, being only 10 minutes cab ride away from the Maglev. Aug 3 2008 	Great hotel  swish rooms	The Sheraton Pudong in Shanghai is a brilliant hotel.The rooms are beautifully decorated, with all items. The bathroom is immaculate with both rain shower and bath.Great wardrobe, safe etc. The breakfast is amazing.There is also a great fitness centre with a large swimming pool and a very well equipped gym.The location is not bad - but ok for business not as a tourist. Jun 21 2008 	Beautiful hotel not a great tourist location	Similar to others' posts, I agree that this is a very beautiful hotel, very good service howver not in an exciting location. Because it's a new hotel I had some difficulty with taxis finding it, even with the hotel's business card. The metro/subway station across the street is the Line 4/Brown/Pudong Nan Lu station and if you take a taxi from the Pudong airport to this hotel it will cost you about 125-150 RMB. It's a quick 10 minute ride from the hotel to the business district in Pudong, about 15 RMB. For business travel, I'd highly recommend staying here. For tourist travel, the location is not ideal as you'll need to take taxis or cabs everywhere. Also, there isn't much immediately around the hotel for a quick bite to eat or a quick mart to pick a few things up. I was upgraded but the rooms are the same on all levels as I had colleagues traveling with me and their rooms on lower levels were the same. Their breakfast is very big and diverse. Rooms come fully equipped with all your needs (safe, iron, hairdryer, etc.) and the beds are quite comfortable. The hotel front desk speaks English quite well and are very helpful, as my Mandarin needs help, so they can help you get to some of the major tourist sites by writing things in Mandarin for you. Apr 22 2008 	Great stay bad location	Great stay, first class all the way. Location could be better. Mar 29 2008 	Great rooms great service funny location	I have stayed here a couple times, and plan to come back. While it is a bit far as the crow flies from the Lujiazui central business area, the cab ride is really fast along the river. If you need to go across to Puxi, you probably want to find a place on the other side of the river. The hotel is also located at a subway stop which can access pretty much anywhere in the city within 45 minutes.The rooms are not huge, but very well executed. Cool views out over Pudong and the Yangpu bridge from upper floors. Excellent breakfast. Won't do anything for your diet, but the fresh croissants are really good. Also had a good room service dinner... Nasi Goreng. Another good food option is a small grocery in the basement of the department store next door. Fresh sushi and similar items.Concierges went above and beyond to help me with some issues (lost luggage). Mar 15 2008 	Excellent value in Shanghai	I travel to China very frequently, and you cannot imagine the hotel horrors I have been through. Sheraton has done a brilliant job in Shanghai. It's very good value. For the price of the usual two - three stars, you get a close to downtown location in Pudong - very important if you're travelling on business. It means staying off from the manic traffic to and fro the Puxi side, where other hotel at same price levels are usually located. The bed is excellent with plush supportive down pillows. The bathroom is large and immaculately clean. It even comes with a 'rainforest' shower.I just had a few problems during my stay there. But these are unrelated to the staff. I've found the wardrobe that opens and closes in both the bedroom and bathroom a bit werid. Same as glass pane door for my loo, and finding the bathtub inside another glass pane designed to be the shower. (The designer had too much fun with these.The bathroom is a bit overdone in my opinion.)Also, the bedside switches only control the reading lights and the lights near the door. It's a bit annoying that I have to switch off the desk lamp and the lamp next to the sofa.Other than that, the staff are friendly and smart. It was a very quick checkin. The food is nice. The staff don't expect to be tipped. (Usual when you pay, other places return your changes with loads of coins, expecting you to leave some behind. In Sheraton, they hand you all the changes in notes with both hands.)All in all, I have enjoyed my stay in Shanghai. If Sheraton can do something similar in Beijing - that would make me very happy. Feb 2 2008 	Great hotel I enjoyed it	This is a new hotel located in the Pudong District. There is also a Four Points Sheraton located right next door, which is somewhat confusing to taxi drivers though mine were always able to get me to the hotel from the airport or other locations. There is a subway station located in front of the hotel. I had an Executive Room and found it to be very nice, the bed was firm but not too hard, much better than most China hotel beds. There is a large flat screen TV in the room and a nice desk work area with free internet access. My room offered a view of the Huang Pu River and while not particularly scenic, it is very interesting to watch the high volume of ship traffic. The restaurant has an excellent selection for breakfast with a buffet style selection of Asian and Western foods with fruits, cereals and pastries. The dinner menu is pretty much Western food and acceptable. Lunch can be ordered ala carte or buffet and again the buffet offered an excellent selection of food. I stayed during the snow storm of January 2008 and the attendants were helpful in getting cabs and encouraged the guests to wait indoor to stay out of the cold. There is a bar area in the lobby area. My business required me to check in, leave for travel and then check in again during a 1 week period and both check ins and check outs were efficient. Because of the snow storm, I did not walk around the area but didn’t see too much of interest in the area. The room had no problem staying warm. A taxi ride to the Standard Brand Mall and Pearl Tower area is only about 10 minutes. A taxi to Pudong Airport takes around 45 minutes. Nov 13 2007	Good Hotel Inconvenient Location	A very nice, new hotel with a very helpful and friendly staff. It was still their &quot;soft opening&quot;, but everything seemed to be running like clockwork. I was upgraded to a suite that was really quite nice. The only downside is that the hotel is not convenient to the central Pudong area or to the Bund, etc. Also it is not well known yet to the taxi drivers. Even with hotel's card, with the name and map in Chinese, it was a crapshoot what would happen trying to get back in a taxi. One taxi driver took me a few blocks and dropped me at another taxi queue (without charge) because she didn't know where it was. The next one took me to the Hilton first (the pronunciation of Hilton to a native Chinese is apparently not far from Sheraton, interestingly). It was a hassle. The one advantage of the location is that it is closer to the airport than hotels that are more centrally located. And although the place is out of the way there was never a problem getting a taxi from the hotel. Jul 30 2007 	Loved it	I stayed in June 2007 over a weekend.Although the hotel is newly opened (and still has the &quot;new&quot; smell), the staff is just GREAT. Helpful, nothing is too much, they go out of their way to say &quot;Hello&quot; and assist guests with anything!Someone lost his mobile in a taxi and they didn't rest until the phone was returned!Great experience.Thomas Jul 16 2007 	great hotel not good location	Although this hotel is locating at Pudong area, it is a little far away from downtown pudong, around 15 mins by taxi. As a SPG plus member I was upgraded to the prefereed floor, but I didnt see any difference except the high floor. From my room I could see the beautiful skyline of pudong area, charming! The room was very clean, big and comfortable. Bathroom was big with two doors, one was opened to the corridor and another door was facing to the bed. Water pressure was ok though, the Forest Rain shower head was not as good as the one of Westin Shanghai. the only thing I didnt like was the internet was so expensive, about 7 dollar for one hour! Jul 7 2007 	Friendly New Hotel	Our group was booked at the Sheraton Hotel in Pudong last week since we had a regional meeting in Shanghai. Upon arrival at the hotel, I immediately noticed that this place is new and has elegant interiors. All the staff I met, from the bellhop to the front desk, were very courteous.The room I got was fairly large and with nice modern furnishings. I had a comfortable king size bed, a flat screen TV, and a big shower room and bath tub with a separate cubicle for the toilet. As mentioned in the previous post, I had no trouble sleeping because of the lovely bed and pillows plus I did not hear any noise coming from outside the room. Although there were different rates for internet access in the room, we were able to arrange with the hotel for our group to have free access to check our e-mail and browse the web.Breakfast buffet was not a problem since there were plenty of food to choose from. If you are not in a hurry, it is better to have your breakfast after 8am when there are less people in the restaurant. The place was a little packed when I had breakfast before 7am.There was one problem though that I encountered during my first night's stay. The door of my room had a defective lock since it can be opened from outside even without using a keycard. I called the front desk about this and they sent their engineering guys to fix it. After spending some time trying to do some repairs, they finally decided to replace the entire locking mechanism. The manager of the hotel sent me a fruit platter as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience this caused me. Apr 7 2007 	New hotel - still working out the kinks	Stayed here for one night in April 2007; were told at check-in that the hotel had only been open for one week. Rooms are large and comfortable, and I would recommend staying at a Sheraton hotel simply for their mattresses. They have much softer mattresses than any other hotel I've stayed at in China (most places feel like you are sleeping on a board). The sheets on our beds felt like they were brand new and never washed; they felt stiff and scratchy. There was a light in front of the door that we couldn't turn off, as it did not seem to be wired to any of the switches in the room. It was the last night of an almost 3-week long trip though, so we were too tired to be bothered by it. The pool and health club are not open yet, the minibar was not fully stocked, and they have only a limited room service menu (had to call to ask for a menu as there was not one in the room, and they made us turn it back in after we'd ordered). The location is near to attractions such as the Bund and the TV Tower (which was visible from my window), a 40 - 60 minute cab ride from the international airport, and about a 30 minute ride from the domestic airport. Staff here are all very new, and act like &quot;trainees&quot;; we were taken on a tour of our room, accompanied by two staff members when all we really wanted was a speedy check-in and some privacy. There is also still some construction work in progress on some of the guest floors. I would stay here again, but hopefully by that time they will have worked out the kinks (and washed the sheets!)

"Nov 24 2021 	The Stall of the Golf Course very rude but this is the main reason to stay there.	I am going to bullet my experience:- location is an hour plus from Shanghai downtown, one way by hotel shuttle, fees- Western restaurant on location, the western food not so good, wine selection limited.- Chinese restaurant on location, Dynasty is more like cafeteria style (food is so so), Zen Den Herbal Restaurant food is good and staffs are friendly, some authentic dishes I enjoyed. The other Chinese restaurants are consolidated to Zen Den. Korean restaurant have not tried.- Spa is clean, staffs are friendly. - Golf, I did not play because I was turned off by the staff while checking out the golf course.- The other facilities ( go kart, archery, ping pong, pool) are just average at most.- Craft studio is closed,- From location you can hire a car and driver to take you to Suzhou City, Hangzhou City, Zhouzhuang, Da Guan Yuan Garden, Zhujiajiao, Shesshan. Beware time of travel takes longer than estimate due to weather and traffic congestion. The further the destination, allow more time than estimated. The drivers are very friendly but with limited English skill. Make sure to wear the seat belt as the drive by ifself is an experience.- The staffs have limited speaking skill.B.Fu, California Oct 24 2018 	Loved Sun Island	My husband and I traded our Tahoe Time Share for a week at the Sun Island International Resort [-]. This is located about 45 minutes west of Shanghai on an island in the River Mao. The resort occupies most of the island and includes 2 extremely nice golf courses, a spa, several restaurants, a horse riding ring, an outdoor pool/slide area (closed fall/winter), a Go-cart track and many other “activity” venues. Bicycle rental is on the island within the resort and shuttles instantaneously appear at your door whenever you want to go from one part of the resort to another. Note though – activities are seasonal and if you want a FULL experience (wave pools, etc) go in the summer.The resort was very, very nice, well kept, clean, and a wonderful place to stay. The grounds and gardens are spectacular and they have an army of gardeners to keep it so. We were there in October 2018 during National Day holidays. When we arrived, the resort (which is generally frequented by Chinese families), was empty. On National Day and through the weekend, it was full. Trading a time-share is particularly good, because Interval International (the organization one trades timeshares through) provides you with a “Guide” who takes care of any arrangements you may need or want. Our guide was a wonderful young woman named Elaine and we relied on her a great deal to arrange trips into Shanghai, getting back to the airport, etc. We had difficulty arranging things at first because the website was in the process of being rebuilt and was not accessible in English so we weren’t sure how to get there from the airport. We finally called the resort and they arranged a driver to pick us up at the PuDong airport (and hour and a half drive from the resort). Mr. Su was at the airport when we arrived and took us to the resort for a flat fee of $335 RMB and all was well. There seem to be a number of “business” meetings and often the restaurants had business groups. However, it was never over-crowded and we were always able to get a table. There are several restaurants at the resort so there is a wide variety of choices for meals. There is even a “western” restaurant where an incredible breakfast buffet is served that includes made-to-order omelets and a number of Chinese and western dishes. Restaurant will also deliver to your lodging (we even did that one night). The accommodations were great – we had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath chalet type of lodging. Many lodgings are stand-alone. It sort of has a “Tudor England” style to it. Our unit had 2 stories with a living room, kitchen, bath and bedroom downstairs and a bath/bedroom upstairs. I can’t say enough for the service, cleaning, maintenance, and shuttle. It was all really well done and reliable. The pictures on their website are recent and shows how it really looks including the furnishings, etc.Getting to Shanghai from the resort involved buying a ticket on the shuttle which is scheduled to go at 9AM and return at 9PM and costs 50RMB per person. If you (or your group) are the only people going to Shanghai, you can and go/return any time you’d like (minimum charge is for 3 people). We did that 3 days and spent the days wandering through different sections of Shanghai. It was really convenient and the drive into Shanghai city center is only about 45 minutes (traffic included). Would we recommend Sun Island? Absolutely. Especially if you are a golfer or a Spa fan. Jun 16 2018 	Excellent	We have just returned from a week at the Shanghai Sunisland Golf Club Resort. The resort is excellent. When we reach there, we were picked up by the hotel mini van which we book earliers. The drive from Pudong Int'n Airport to Sunisland is 1hr 45 mins. We reach the resort around 9.pm and was greeted by Joyce, whom is allocated to us to attend to our needs. The check in took only 15 mins. She bring us to our chalet and the chalet is wonderful. The resort has a horse range, go-kart, spa, golf and swimming pool. All these you have to pay in order to enjoy the facilities. The weather in Shanghai at the time is ending of spring. So, is a bit cooling. As the resort is located outskirt which is near Zhang Jia Jiou, the air in the morning is so refreshing. Our resort is full of beautiful flowers and trees. All the chalet are name according to the trees and flowers that are grown around that areas. The resort come with 4 restaurants ie Korean restaurant, Chinese Restaurant, the one allocate in the main lobby and last one is the Szechuan Restaurant. The restaurant that we been to is mostly the Chinese Restaurant whereby the food is pretty good and reasonable.As for the pool, I have no comments because unable to use it because it is closed and only opened in 6/6/2018. As for the horse ride and the go-kart, both of my sons love it. Both of my sons is between the age of 13 and 6.The place that I stay is near Zhang Jia Jiou and surrounding this area there is a beautiful sight seeing place where the Mission Impossible Three has been filmed. The scenery there is beautiful. That is the place whereby we bought a lot of paintings and sourvenirs. A word of advise, must bargain.The service provided is excellent. There is one time where our burner has some short circute and we ask for room service and within 10 mins the technician came. Talking about fast service.In the resort, they also provide shuttle bas to drive you to any destination inside the resort. You only need to give room service a call.Overall I would say this is a good resort and the service is excellent.The only down part is very far from Shanghai town. Oct 13 2021 	Shanghai Sun Island int'l club est un excellent resort"
"Aug 13 2021 	Great hostel but kitchen needs improvement	big and nice rooms and overall good experience. staff is helpfulkitchen opening times need to be mentioned as we tried to order lunch at 11:15 am and they could not make fried rice yet.Overall nice place and easy to get taxis and a short walk to the subway. Jul 30 2021 	Pleasantly surprised.....	Getting to the hostel across Wuning road..... is an achievement in itself, but aside from that - it is a lovely hostel:)We are backpacking for 8 months and we had a twin room with ensuite, however the facilities were such that i could have easily used the dorms. The washroom facilities were excellent and cleaned everyday. Our ensuite was quite large and had a separate shower cubicle (a luxury!) and was extremely clean. The staff were helpful, if a little harrassed!! We stayed during the eclipse and it was very busy. Breakfast is ok, computers are good (but not free as advertised , ok only 1 Yuen per 15 mins but that isnt free!!). The food is good in the restaurant. Relatively close to the subway and easy to get around. Shanghai was disappointed but we werent by this hostel - would definietly recommend. Feb 16 2021	Phone Stolen from locked private room in this hostel....awful experience!	On the surface this hostel is clean and seems well run but having had my mobile phone stolen out of my locked private room here, I would suggest to anyone considering this place to avoid it all costs! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week as part of a 6 month round the world trip adn 4 weeks spent in China. This was the only place we experienced any robbery. After visiting nearly 40 hostels in 6 months that says something!When we told the hostel staff that my phone was missing and we wanted to report it to the police, they sent a member of the reception team to the police station with us and told us to lie.The guy from the hostel did all the talking to the police but refused to tell them my phone had been stolen in the hostel and made up a story that I had been mugged in the street. He then told me to sign a statement which he had made with the police officer and when I said I wanted him to sign it as well he became really aggressive and starting shouting at me. I was really frightened as was my boyfriend who has travelled the world with me twice and we have never experienced anything like that!I found the majority of staff to seem sweet and innocent before my phone was stolen but afterwards there was definitely an intimidating under current with them and they would hang around glaring at the foreigners in the reception area where there is the internet access and bar. It seemed like there might have been some sort of organised crime going on in there and everyone was in on it. Conveniently the security guard had a phone indentical to mine that he was fixated with and playing around with all day, the day after mine was stolen. V strange! Nov 13 2018 	Big bustling hostel	This hostel is not in the most picturesque part of Shanghai, and getting to it across the manic Wuning Rd is something of an achievement. The hostel itself is set back from the road in a sort of cul-de-sac, so is shielded from the worst of the noise from the road. It is a huge place. There are two residential blocks, a large reception/internet/seating area linking the two blocks and a large bar leading off that. As a single traveller in Shanghai for work, I thought it would be a good place to meet people. However, the socialising aspects were far outweighed by the inconvenience of the location and the general standard of the facilities. There are two showers and two toilets for each sex on each floor, and although I never had to queue, they did get pretty smelly and dirty. There are hot water rooms on every other floor, and one kitchen and two washing machines per block. This makes it really inconvenient if you want to make yourself a cup of coffee or heat up some noodles. The bar does food, and it is reasonably priced and tasty- but make sure they put your order into their computer or prepare for an unpleasant stand-off with the staff when your dinner doesn't come. There is also a buffet breakfast included in the room price, but it is not great- cereal, (cold) steamed buns and red bean porridge. The internet is intolerably slow and with only seven terminals between 500 travellers be prepared for a long wait. Finally, this is not a hostel for anyone who needs a good nights' rest. The long, institutional corridors magnify every sound- particularly people who have locked themselves out of their rooms in the early hours.Having said all that, if you're after a big, fun, cheap hostel where you can drink cheap beers with fellow travellers over a game of pool or FIFA on the PS2 during your week in Shanghai, then this might be just the place for you. Oct 20 2018 	Impressed!	We're three girls mid 20's sharing a triple private ensuite in this hostel and in the week and a half we have been here we have been very impressed. Contrary to the name, the hostel is definitely not city centre, however having read other reviews on this website we knew that before we came and realised being central would be way over our budget. It's really easy to pick up a taxi outside the hostel and takes about 15 minutes to get to People's Square, costing less than £3.00. Our room is pretty large and gets cleaned every day, we're getting towels replaced and some free items such as toothbrushes and shampoo have been provided. The staff seem really nice. There's air conditioning in the room which appears to be free of charge and the internet (via lan cable) is slow, especially at peak times, but it works. The shower is hot and a good pressure. We went to the restaurant one night. We were not expecting it to be great but we really enjoyed it. We were after a western fix and the pasta and pizza were very tasty and tasted really fresh. We had some noisy neighbours a couple of nights which was annoying but part and parcel of staying in a hostel so we didn't complain and they didn't stay long. Some of the reviews mentioned the beds being hard, and they are firm but we haven't had any problems sleeping in that respect. It's definitely worth taking the hostel card out which has the address in Chinese as well as a small map on the back, as hardly any taxi drivers speak or read English, and if you come from the airport in a taxi make sure you have the address printed as it's down a side street which would be pretty difficult to find first time.The hostel is very close to a subway station also.If I return to Shanghai I'd definitely stay here again. Sep 26 2018 	Just great	After having travelled for a month around the northeast of China and having visited 6 cities and 6 different hostels, I can say this is the best of all!! Clean, modern, new, the staff are nice and speak english, they offer a free breakfast (very good by the way!!), free internet that works and enough PC's!!! And a free shuttel bus to the city center (the subway station is not far either). The lounge and bar area are also great. This is the place to stay in Shanghai!! Sep 14 2018 	Great hostel in Shanghai	I stayed at this youth hostel for a week. The hostel itself is large and many of the facilities are more hotel-like, especially the single and double rooms, which I both tried (see below). The hostel facilities are good. There is free internet, free in-room (slow) wifi, TVs in all rooms, and air conditioning in the rooms. The bar/restaurant area is pleasant and a good place to meet people in the evenings. There are laundry facilities and the hostel staff can help with booking train tickets, airport rides and other transport.At first I was in a standard single room on the ground floor. The room was ok, with a single bed and free wifi, a toilet and shower, and a kettle with green tea sachets. However, the bed was super-hard, and space was kinda limited. There are only two small lights in the room, which made it dark – and the desk lamp kept spluttering so I tried not to touch it. Add to that the fact that the windows gave out onto the front entrance, which also made it noisy when people congregate outside for a smoke or a chat. Lastly, the air conditioning unit in all rooms has controls in Chinese – and the handset in the room stopped working after a short while, which only gave me the choice of having the unit off, or on full blast. My stay in a single room was short, however, as one dark morning a storm moved in over Shanghai, and a very big leak opened in the ceiling of the room, flooding the floor. The staff was very quick and efficient in moving me to a double room.Double rooms are similar to single rooms, but overall more pleasant – more space, the air con unit was newer, the beds were thankfully softer. You also get better quality shampoo, I noticed....although I’d recommend to buy shampoo in the supermarket. Getting to the hostel is easy as long as you have taxi directions in Chinese, and remember that the road is not Wuning Nan Road, but Wuning Road proper. You can also get there by metro (Caoyang St. stop), but I can see how that could be a bit confusing, as the metro station has 3 different exits. The rule of thumb is, exit the metro, turn right and follow the tracks a short distance towards an intersection of two big roads, one of which is Wunin. Cross the road (taking good care), and the hostel is a short ways through a gated entrance to your right.Around the hostel, you can find some cheap places to eat. If you walk out onto Wuning Rd and turn right, you can find a meal for 10 yuan. There is also a small shop just outside the hotel, but the owner’s livelihood seems to depend on fleecing non-Chinese tourists....a bottle of Nongfu Spring water there cost me 5 yuan (more than I would pay for a bottle of water in Europe!), but at any Family Mart in Shanghai the standard price is 1.7 yuan.The reception staff speaks English and is very pleasant and willing to help. The bar staff was a bit stand-offish when I was there, at one point shouting at me because I asked the same question twice (I did not understand the answer the first time....I was trying my best, but I’ve only taken a few months of Mandarin!).The only negatives about this hostel were the inconsistent room service - items were not necessarily replaced very often, such as shampoo or tea. Also, the wireless stopped working for a few days and none of the staff seemed to know why, or when it would be fixed - this left a lot of travellers having to line up for the free computers. Tip: the bar has ethernet points, and the front desk is more than happy to lend you ethernet cables if you need them. So if you have your own laptop, ethernet in the bar is a lot faster than wifi in your room. Mar 28 2018 	Great place not 5 star but incredible for the price	When in China, do as the Romans do....This fantastic hostel has accomodations for sharing and private rooms, all incredibly cheap. I stayed in a private room for a month while taking a course and can not begin to expound on the wonderful staff, management and facilities. My only gripe was the really bad tp. You can buy your own cheap at the Carrefour down the street. One plus is a really amazing street market, behind the hostel. I bought eggs (by the ones) and fruit daily. mandarin oranges and the best apples. Cooked the eggs (hard boiled) in the electric teapot provided in the room.There is a house dog named Chris that loves or hates you. It became my mission to have him love me...he did, finally."
"Aug 4 2021 	Convenient	1) Cleaniness: room was clean.2) Location: centralised location with Nanjing Road is a short walk away, not too bad for the price and in comparison with the prices of hotels in the surrounding area.3) Rooms: for a local hotel the room was a bit small, but adequately equipped. There is no satellite TV, so we only had chinese channels. The bed was really hard though.4) Service: I would have had little complaints about this hotel if not for the service. We'd asked for a late check-out (for 2 pm) the night before and the next morning the reception called to ask abt our check-out. We told the lady that we arranged with her colleague the night before tht we were checking out late, and then she told us to make sure we were out of the room before 2pm. We turned up at the reception counter 15 mins late. And the lady then rudely and unnecessarily informed us &quot;It's past 2pm&quot; before proceeding with check-out.5) Value: Overall not bad value for the location, but do not expect any good service. Jul 29 2021 	Great location good hotel	Excellent location close to the Bund and metro (and diagonally across from the Westin - but at a fraction of the price). Rooms a good size and with plenty of bathroom accessories. A little worn but good standard and comfortable. Staff speak some English, definitely enough to communicate fine, and are really friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. Jun 16 2021 	Reasonable price with a great location	Just fine for a city hotel where you spend just the night. Nov 25 2018 	Can't Beat the Location	Fantastic location only a 5 minute walk to the Bund, People's Park, and main shopping areas. The hotel was very clean and neat with a large room with a double bed- more than enough room for 2 people to be comfortable, with a desk and sitting area and spacious bathroom. The bed was solid as a rock and appeared to only be a box spring and no mattress which was strange.The breakfast was served next door in a restaurant which was overpriced and terrible with service to match. You are better off going elsewhere or picking up breakfast items at a bakery or convenience store. One of the added bonuses was the free internet and computer right in the hotel room. Staff weren't overly friendly but were still helpful. We had some problems checking out as the night staff speaks little to no English (day staff speak English so be sure to make arrangements for taxis or check-out during the day!). Make sure you bring proper documentation if you pay and book in advance through a website as the non-English speaking desk cleark tried to charge us for the room again as he failed to grasp the concept that we had paid in advance. Thanks to another guest who spoke Mandarin we were able to sort it all out. And there is a room deposit charge of about $30 Canadian that we never figured out what exactly it was for.Enough restaurants within walking distance. Other than the check-out problem which we were able to sort out, the hotel was a great place to stay for location and price. Nov 4 2017 	Very good deal 5 minutes from the Bund	Great little hotel for a reasonnable price. Located by foot at 5 minutes from the Bund and 10 from People Square. Clean cute rooms, well decorated, cumfortable beds. Ask for the discounted rates, which are about 30% off the 'offcial price'. I paid 70 euros for a large room, with 2 large windows offering a nice view, a desk with a computer connected to internet for free, a sofa, and all the usual : minibar, safe, tea and coffee machine, etc.Only drawback : no english channels on the TV, but the rest is perfect for the price compared to other hotels I've been to in Shanghai."
"Nov 25 2021 	Next door to railway station	Just next door to railway station, I checked out 30 minutes before train departed, nice room and service, food is average, good value in the center of Shanghai. Nov 16 2021 	Excellent location	I have stayed at Yafan longmen hotel Shanghai a couple of times on business trips and while it is a typical hotel the staffs are very helpful .The real benefit of this hotel is its close proximity to the railway. When I came back from one long train journey it was nice to just walk across the square to get to the hotel. Rooms are reasonably priced and they have Internet connection, The restaurant is ok but fairly standard. Jul 24 2021 	Pleasant rooms good location but sex massage?!	I traveled to Shanghai with a handful of students. Most of our trip was spent in housing, but our final night was spent at the Longmen. We had a pleasant experience. The location is good, as it is a 3-5 minute walk to the train, making downtown an easy 10 minute ride away.The rooms must have recently been redone, as I found the fixtures and furnishings in great condition. A great room for a mid-range hotel. The heating also worked well, an important thing to note in Shanghai, where the weather and the reliability of heating systems can be unpredictable.The one thing that bothered me most was my interaction with the host at the spa (located on the upper ground level). I was sick during the trip, and thought a massage would do the trick. The rates were somewhat expensive for Asia, but I was floored when he said, &quot;sex massage only $XX.&quot; (I don't remember how much). I had to ask him to repeat it a few times, as I could not believe that I was being offered sex at the Best Western! All I kept thinking was what if a student had gone down!!!Anyway, the only other criticism I have is that the restaurant where the breakfast is held is really in need of refurbishing. Perhaps that is next on the list. Otherwise, a pleasant and positive experience. May 13 2021 	Close to train	Nice Hotel, 4 stars are the right. There are masterpieces of carved wood.&quot;Bussines center&quot; with poor English and to expensive Internet connection. Wireless not working.The hotel is next to the train station, not far from the bus station, however 30-40min to the center with the taxi. Aug 11 2018 	No longer Best Western but still OK.	This hotel ceased to be affiliated with the Best Western brand as of May 2018, but it remains a very useful &amp; comfortable place stay in Shanghai, especially for anyone needing/wanting a hotel very close to the main railway station (which is just a few minutes walk away - see pictures). Aug 2 2018 	Good Hotel Location just ok	Surprisingly nice for a Best Western.Location is not ideal, it is next to the train station, which means taking taxi’s to get anywhere. Unlike Beijing or Xi’an, there is no taxi queue in front of the hotel. Flagging a taxi was mixed bag. The taxi’s at the adjacent train station were not interested in short runs. And there was no one at the hotel to help get a taxi either. Rooms were decent size, clean and well stocked. The king bedded rooms at the end of the halls were downright huge. No issues with service, everyone was pleasant and friendly. There was a small mix up when they reassigned one of our rooms to someone else, but that was solved almost immediately.Breakfast was actually quite good. Nice spread with lots of choices, the coffee was hot and refills were quick.Not a bad hotel at all, but the location is against it. Shanghai cabs can be a pain, and being dependent on cabs was not ideal. I prefer a hotel that has interesting stuff in walking range, and there are plenty of these in Shanghai Jun 21 2018 	Excellent hotel though a bit out of the way	Got a very reasonable rate on this 3-4 star (by US standards) hotel. The rooms were immaculate, the staff was very helpful with english speaking help readily available. The breakfast was a little over-priced by Chinese standards but very good with lots of options. It is located in the everbright neighborhood near a shopping area, some fast food joints, and plenty of little shops where you can buy water, snacks, and extra luggage (if you're about to fly back and need more room for souvenirs).The only real negative about the hotel is that during rush hour, getting to many of the popular tourist attractions (the bund, french concession, nanjing street, etc) is a good 30-40minute taxi drive (still a cheap ride ... $3-4USD). Outside of rush hour, it was only ~10-15minutes. So if you're the type that likes to stop back at your hotel intermittently, then this is probably not the place for you. If like us, you only stop back perhaps once during the day and then crash in your room at the end of the night, this was a very reasonably priced (&lt;$70) place thats not too far. If this place was on the bund, the rooms would easily be running for $150+.The 2 complimentary waters daily were nice as well. Nov 21 2017 	Average; location ok; not the greatest hotel	Hotel is newly built, so the rooms are clean, nice, and decent. However, the location is not ideal--while it is within walking distance to the train station and metro, etc, it is not convenient to find nice dining options or a general store nearby. The free breakfast is just ok. Stick with the plain porridge to be safe. The attempts at pastries should be complimented (they try), but better just to serve toast than concoctions. Staff is hit-and-miss, sometimes friendly and helpful, at other times they ignore you. Mar 18 2021 	?????????????????? Aug 23 2018 	?????????????"
"Oct 22 2021	Acceptable	We stayed here as part of a Travelsphere holiday, our bedroom was clean however it smelt musty, it needs an overhaul, the food was good plenty of choice, it was ok for the time we were there, the hotels for the rest of the tour just got better and better. Sep 21 2021	Shabby but good food. Fine if cheap	Eighties bathrooms, nicotine stained walls and dated furnishings, however the food is good. We stayed as part of a Travelsphere tour and this was way below all the other hotels they use. A surprising choice. The bar was rarely open, the pool derelict and it was difficult to persuade staff to open the internet centre (although they forgot to charge for it). Next to a metro but not very central. If you get a good deal its not dire but don't pay full prices, you will be disappointed. Jan 11 2021 	Great location	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights one week apart.This hotel is locate right next (literally) to a subway station in line 1 (Hanzhong Road), one stop from the train station and 2 stops from the People's Square, both reachable easily and quickly on foot.The hotel is located in a good neighborhood and taxis will find it with no trouble. Nanjing Road is 10 minutes away on foot.The standard rooms were quite clean and spacious with a bed, closet, desk and bathroom.Beds were wide enough for 2 people (though I stayed alone) with good mattresses and linen. I didn't find the mattress too hard but some people might. Hard mattresses are quite common in China.The room was non-smoking and there were no smoke smells.The bathroom was clean, with a western style (american) toilet and a bathtub. The water pressure was not very strong but enough for a good shower. Standard amenities were offered (soap, shampoo, cap, toothbrush and paste) as well as the standard discardable flip flops in China.A nice thing were the 2 daily bottles of mineral water placed in the room.The room had an electrical thermos that made preparing tea or quick meals very easy and convenient.The rooms faced the main road but were quite quiet and naturally lit with large windows.Some minor details showed that the hotel was a little worn out such as loose internet connection plug, minor marks in the furniture and dents in the bathtub.Internet access had enough bandwidth for my needs and allowed for making computer to phone calls with good quality.The staff did everything in their power to help me at 11 PM regarding a problem with train tickets even when it wasn't their fault at all. I was given access to the business center and helped with contacting the travel agency.The only problem I had was that they booked a taxi to the airport even though I never asked them to. This created some minor friction at the very end of the trip.Summing everything this stay was great value for money and a great way to explore Shanghai.Recommended. Jan 9 2021 	Good deal for the money!	This hotel was offered on Travelocity when we booked our (dirt cheap) flights. We got a great deal for 9 nights in a superior room at the Zhao An PLUS RT airfare from Charlotte, NC, USA for just over a grand! At that price I wasn't expected much but was pleasantly surprised. Since we were trying to save money, we decided to arrive at the hotel via the Maglev/metro straight to the Han Zhong metro station right under the hotel (note: there is not an escalator from the ticketing level to the exit 4 in this metro station-we did have to carry the bags up to the hotel entrance) . The flight touched down about 2.30 pm and by 4pm we were at the hotel and checked in with a smile! We had prepaid, however there was a key deposit, but that's normal in Chinese Hotels and was refunded when we left. The room we were given at first though was NOT a superior room and did not match the pictures shown on the hotel website. This first room was a tiny, tiny room with one full sized bed shoehorned in. After polite, but insistent negotiation with a junior manager (Neil) we were given the room next door for the same price, which had two full beds and was considerably larger. Both rooms were clean and well maintained, with a fridge, hot water kettle, tv etc. The beds were &quot;chinese-firm&quot;, and the bathroom spotless with plenty of hot water. The staff at the hotel were most accommodating and had some English skills, so that, with my broken Chinese we were able to communicate pretty well. The bellboys were especially helpful, as were the front desk staff. We had to have clothes cleaned and it was picked up and delivered very quickly.The best part of staying at the Zhao An was its location. Either by metro or by bus it's easy and cheap to get just about any where in Shanghai. Catycorner to the Hotel is a bank with an international ATM. There is a main South bound bus stop on the opposite side of the street just North of the hotel on Heng Tong lu with upwards of 10 lines. For example, the number 801 will take you to the Yuyuan Gardens (7 stops to Xin BeiMen, walk a block over). Coming back to the hotel by bus is easy too. Additionally, the main railway station is a couple of blocks away, and has restaurants and stores in the area.... including a Pizza Hut!They do have a breakfast buffet at the hotel. I thought it was a little expensive (8$ bucks), but they do have adequate food on it; some Western and some Chinese.All in all, I think this hotel is a great place to stay and I would stay again in a heart beat. Jan 7 2021	Bare Necessities	For less than $50 a night, we got a big room and big bed good enough for sleeping. The room is on the 14th floor (topmost) and looked a bit shabby; its carpet and wall paper have seen better days but for the price we paid, we were willing to overlook these aesthetics. We stayed at this hotel because it was accessible, the subway station exit was just next door, less than 1 minute walk. There is also a convenient store right across the street. For those travelling across China, I recommend the website www.ctrip.com (no worries, there is an english version), this is where we book our hotel room and the prices are unbeatable. It's a relatively safe website; Ctrip being listed in a major stock exchange. I used my credit card to book the hotels and everything went smoothly. Oct 10 2018 	AVOID AT ALL COSTS	Stayed one night there on 2 Oct 2018.Room was clean but condition was very run down, water damaged ceiling and bare wood wardrobes. Room service tried to force open the door while it was chained off - happened twice.Did not bother to knock and wait for response.Did not get breakfast as per review here.Tried to extend another night, but refused same rate. They asked for more than double the rate i paid for first night. So i hired the internet to book another night through the same online agent in singapore.Internet was extremely slow and timeout all the time and it was charged by the minute. The business centre was not staffed and there was no paper to use for printing.Came back a few nights later because it was already paid for. Arrived at 4am. Was asked to wait until 10AM before allowed to check in. Another kind hearted reception allowed us to check in at 7AM.But her duty manager (Richard Cheong) refused entry for my fiancee because this time she accidentally left her purse in another bag which we left in another city. She was not asked for ID when we stayed for the first two nights. The manager took indifference stance to our problems. In his own words. &quot;One person can stay and the other have to go. If you dont want to stay we cannot refund the money, because It is not my problem.&quot; Mar 6 2018 	Good location	The hotel is alongside a subway station but while the subway is clean considering the numbers using it, it is crowded so do not use it if carrying luggage. You have to carry your own luggage up from the taxi. Rooms were clean and adequate, we were in the cheaper rooms. We only used their booking service for a mini bus to the airport, it arrived on time and got us to our destination on time without using the aggressive driving techniques that is common in China.Various eating places nearby including a western one - McD. Nothing outstanding but nothing wrong. Mar 6 2018	nice hotel	The hotel is located ZaBei Area,only 2 Metro stations away from nan jing road, rooms is clean, the hotel offer free internet access &amp; breakfast, and chinese massage(health club) is very nice!shanghai is lovely! Mar 3 2018 	Perfect Hotel at a perfect price; Metro is just next door	The Hotel is located north of the Suzhou Creek, only 2 Metro stations away from People's Square at the Metro Station Hanzhong Road (the entry to the Metro is just next door,... really amazing!)rooms are big, bathroom very clean (and you get one free Nestlé Mineral water every day), free internet access, delicate breakfast,... I don't find any point to criticize.Enjoy your trip to Shanghai! Dec 1 2007	Good Hotel	I stayed here for 4 nights as part of a Travelsphere Tour. The rooms are fine and there is nothing to worry about. There is a nice bar areaand the hotel is opposite a food store that sells english snacks if you arent keen on the chinese food. The hotel is next to a subway which is great to get from place to place. Also, I highly reccomend Travelsphere as all tours I have been on with them have been fantastic. Apr 23 2007	Zhao An- a good 3 star hotel	Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights on a college trip.i was surprised at how nice the rooms were. we had 2 people sharing to one room and we had a double bed each, which was lovely! it was extremly roomy with lots of space to move around in. there was lots of wardrobe space and the cleaners came every day. there was even a telephone next to the toilet in the bathroom- incase you cant make it back in time!the staff were not overly friendly at this hotel but this may have been because they couldnt speak english.the hotel had a lot of facilities but we were so busy that we didnt have time to use most of them. there was a swimming pool on the roof but this wasnt filled up. i doubt anyone would have wanted to use it anyway as it was only about 5 degrees during our stay. i think there was also a gym as well.the restaurant served ok-ish food. it depends on whether you mind trying new things. we only had breakfast there and they did have fry-ups. though this was 'chinese style.' i just had toast with jam every morning.on free evenings, i made the most of the room service. it wasnt overly expensive and was just like ordering a chinese take away! the sweet and sour pork was to die for- the best food i had all week! they bring your food right up to your room on a trolley and give you cutlery as well as chopsticks.the location of the hotel was excellent. it was next to a metro stattion, so you didnt have far to walk to get to places. there was also a shopping district up the road and we could see the pearl tv tower from our window! If traffic noise affects your sleep i wouldn't recommend this hotel, as it is on the corner of a 6-lane road, which was noisy, as the chinese seem to beep all the time! though this may depend on which side of the building your room is on.overall, i did enjoy my stay at this hotel. i think it was more of a 3.5- 4* hotel, rather than a 3*. Aug 22 2006 	3 star hotel	It was what we expected from a 3-star hotel. The staf was friendly, the rooms were clean, the breakfast was good (lots of different food). The location was not good. May 27 2006 	Good value - great location over the metro	We stayed here over a week. We thought it was good value. Very clean. More like 3 and half stars. The hotel sits right on top of the subway entrance which means everything is only a few minutes away by train - avoid peak hour! Some reception staff had good english, others were lacking, but all tried to be helpful. A lot of tour groups stayed here. The &quot;Steak King&quot; accross the road was good value for meals - but don't expect western style food. Nothing much else is nearby. The western breakfast was OK but the bacon was usually cold. The prices for taxis on their website were quite accurate- taxis are cheap in Shanghai, but get reception to write down your destnation in chinese, and carry a map of where the hotel is located - most taxi drivers hadn't heard of it! May 26 2006	Not the best - needs work on staff and management	This was the worst of five hotels we stayed at in China and Hong Kong on a pre-booked tour, so we didn't have any choice where we stayed. Had read the other reviews before we went and confirm that staff on the front desk were very surly and unco-operative ( anumber of our party had problems with being charged for water they had not had from the mini-bar,or were the hotel trying to charge for water bought outsideand brought in?), the bar service was either poor or non-existent (one night the bar was closed because they had set it up for a meeting the next day!), the pool was empty of water as they didn't fill it up until June, although it was already 80^ F at the end of April. In the dining room, they were unprepared for diners wanting a bottle of wine with their dinner - no choice, and confusion in the opening, and having to pay cash as it was delivered! The buffet dinner we has was the poorest quality we experienced in China, and the&quot;Western&quot; dinner which the tour operator had organised had to be seen to be believed (I blame the tour co).On the other hand, the rooms were very spacious and we found them quite clean. When we returned at the end of the tour for one night we were surpised to find ourselves in one of their duplexes, with a lovely spiral staircase leading from the downstairs lounge with TV to the upstairs bedroom with another TV and ensuite etc. The long curtains covering the double height windows by the staircase needed cleaning as did the windows, but overall we enjoyed that room. The only other problem with the rooms was that (and we were not alone in our party with this) the keycard locking system was difficult to operate and didn't work much of the time.There is a Metro station next door to the hotel, and its just off one of the very busy (and chaotic) main roads.As this hotel was included in the tour price, it is not possible for me to say whether or not it is value for money, but you would not want to pay too much to stay here. Aug 17 2005	A little on the seedy side	The Zhao An was the least expensive Shanghai hotel choice on my recent gotoday Beijing/Xian/Shanghai trip. The exterior looked promising, all mirrored glass and angles, but having to drag my bag up the steps into a very small lobby was the first bad sign. The lobby was packed with a group of schoolchildren and an Australian tour group. Checking in took a while and a key deposit was required but they did take Amex. There was a sign saying some guest rooms had high speed internet access at no charge and I requested one.Opening the door to my room was a let down. Seedy is the best word to describe it. The wall behind the luggage platform was very scuffed and the wardrobe was a dated pastel color. My room was one in from the corner and was somewhat oddly shaped, giving me a very large and modern bathroom, the cleanest I had found in China. I also had an alcove with a desk and the promised internet access with a cable. From peeking into other rooms mine was definitely not the norm. The low and firm two full size beds had comforters with covers that were changed daily (if the card was left on the bed) instead of blankets and top sheets. Two free mineral waters were replenished daily.The restaurant offered a buffet breakfast that was included in my package and the best thing about it was the chef who made fresh omelettes. However there were just eggs, no choice of fillings whatsoever. The rest of the buffet was just to satisfy hunger. We chose to eat in the hotel one night and they were out of practically everything. One by one we made our selections and each time the waitress came back and said they were out. She was very pleasant and recommended an excellent dish when I was out of things to order but it was an annoying experience. And the chef did send over a free vegetable dish to apologize.Location wise it seemed a distance away from what I wanted to see but cabs were very cheap. The gift area in the lobby did have the best looking 2018 Beijing Olympics T-shirt I had found anywhere and I'm only sorry I didn't get one for everybody as they all want mine.My friend used the pool but I wouldn't. The tiles had blackened grout and there was no chlorine smell.My friends had to stay an extra day because of booked flights and they were only charged the extra $35 USD group rate so I guess this is a fairly cheap hotel, especially for Shanghai. For the price I would have to say it's a good value but personally I would rather spend the extra money for a better room and location. My friends had already booked when I decided to join them but next time I'll stay away from cheap travel packages and go back to booking my own. Jul 20 2005	A slightly-above-average 3* hotel with definite room for improvement in service	We found the Zhao An to be a slightly-above-average 3* hotel that offers good value for money in Shanghai, which tends to have more expensive hotel rooms than many other Chinese cities. We had booked two Superior rooms, however upon arrival we were upgraded to suites since all of the Superior rooms were occupied. Extremely pleased with this upgrade - the suites were very clean, on two floors and one of them even had a kitchenette. The free ADSL broadband connection in the room generally worked well throughout our stay. Unfortunately can't comment on the other rooms at the hotel since we did not see them.Breakfast was rather disappointing though, and with hindsight we ought not to have bothered, and spent the RMB 40 per breakfast elsewhere. The quality of the buffet and presentation was poor, and the staff generally unhelpful and unfriendly. As breakfast items ran out, staff were often reluctant to provide more when requested. In addition, catering for vegetarians was not at all good.Service at front desk was also rather variable - some staff were efficient and friendly, whereas others did not seem to keen to provide good service - this is a shame. With a little extra training in customer service and improvements to the breakfast facilities, this could be an excellent 3* hotel. May 2 2005	Disappointed	I stay at this hotel because I read good reviews from a website. I am disappointed. First of all, I'm Asian (Thai) and do not speak of word of Chinese.  When I checked in my room, I found out that the air-condition was not working at all. The room has only one window. And being on the 9th floor, it was very windy, plus the construction going on outside was noisy. So, I went down to the front desk and ask if they could get me a different room. This lady looked at me with an attitude, and said &quot;No more room&quot;, and walked away. She didn't even look at her computer or anything. As I stood there dumb founded, she came back with look of &quot;Why am I still there?&quot;. I asked her to get someone to fix the air-con, she said &quot;Okay&quot; and walked away again. I retreated back to my room and felt like being scolded by a school master. So, besides very little English, the front desk people have an attitude. Never once when I leave the hotel did anyone ever ask me if I need a taxi or help in anyway. While I have seen them asked to help any caucasian, and always with a great smile.  One morning, I decided to try their breakfast at 40 Yuan. Arrived at the restaurant at 10:25am. Paid the money and got a seat. Coffee came with no spoon, no sugar and no cream. I usually have a cup or two before eating something. Anyway, as I was going to grab a few things to eat from the buffet table, I was told by a woman to please hurry as they are about to take the food away. They advertised that breakfast was from 7am to 11am, and it was only 10:32am. They should have told me this before I paid my money. I demanded for my money back, and left. The day I checked out, I paid 3135 Yuan for the room and phone calls. I stay 8 days. Then, the guy presented me with another bill (12 Yuan) for a missing hand towel. I tried to tell him that I did not take it. How can I prove that something was not missing? Well, I paid the 12 Yuan so I could just get out of that hotel. Again, with 2 luggages, no one helped me.  Not all were bad of course, the room, bed, blanket, and towels were clean. The room got done twice daily. The bathroom was good. The maid were nice and friendly, unlike the front desk people. Two free bottles of water daily. However, the coffee in the room is 2 Yuan per package. Beware. May 2 2005	????????? May 2 2005	?????? Aug 31 2021 	????? Aug 29 2021 	??? Aug 22 2021 	??????????
