"ETC: These are the overloaded cars of South Korean workers fleeing North Korea Filed under: Government/Legal , South Korea Around 175 South Korean workers have been forced to pack up their belongings and leave a group of jointly operated factories in North Korea after tensions continued to escalate between the two countries. The workers piled tools and finished products high onto the roofs of regular passenger cars as they evacuated as quickly as possible. North Korea says the ongoing talks with its southern neighbor geared toward keeping the factory complex operational were ""deceptive"" given that the US and South Korean armed forces continue to practice joint drills nearby. South Korea , meanwhile, was concerned that workers could be deprived of food or medicine if the situation continued to sour. The evacuation has placed the future of factories operated jointly by the two countries into question and marks the most significant casualty of the continued degradation of relations between the neighbors. It is unclear when or if the facilities will reopen. These are the overloaded cars of South Korean workers fleeing North Korea originally appeared on Autoblog on Sun, 28 Apr 2013 19:07:00 EST.

"Official: Chrysler investing $20M in Toledo plant to support 9-speed auto production Filed under: Plants/Manufacturing , Chrysler , Dodge , Jeep In 2011, Chrysler announced a $72-million investment in its Toledo Machining Plant to modernize production of the eight- and nine-speed torque-converters for automatic transmissions made there. That upgrade work won't be finished until Q3 of this year, but Chrysler has already announced a further $19.6-million investment to increase production capacity for the nine-speeders. The extra units will be necessary because the nine-speed transmission they'll be mated to is going into three popular models: it will debut on the 2014 Jeep Cherokee , then go into the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart . The company predicted that this year alone it would sell 200,000 units equipped with the nine-speed tranny, and it is spending some $374 million in addition to the investment in Toledo to upgrade production capacity for it. The work attached to this new investment won't begin until Q3 of 2014, and it will be finished by the end of that year. There's a press release below with all the details.

With this announcement, the Company's total investments in its U.S. operations since June 2009 increase to over $5.2 billion. The new torque converters will be paired with the next generation, fuel efficient nine-speed front-wheel drive transmission being assembled at Chrysler Group's Indiana (Kokomo, Ind.) Transmission Plant I. The new transmission will debut in the 2014 Jeep® Cherokee. ""The new nine-speed transmission is a critical part of our strategy to meet fuel economy requirements over the next several years and Toledo Machining will play an integral role in bringing this transmission to market,"" said Scott Garberding, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, Chrysler Group LLC. ""Securing this additional investment is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the plant's workforce and helps secure its future long-term."" The investment will fund the installation of new equipment and tooling for additional machining and assembly capacity. Installation is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2014 and will be completed by the end of 2014. In August 2011, a $72 million investment in Toledo Machining was announced to modernize the plant to produce the eight- and nine-speed torque converters on two new production lines and a new steering column for the Dodge Dart and Jeep Cherokee. These installations will be complete in the third quarter this year. ""We're very pleased that Chrysler is once again investing in the Toledo Machining Plant and the skilled workforce there,"" said General Holiefield, Vice President and Director, UAW Chrysler Department. ""This will help preserve and enhance jobs in the area and give a greater measure of security to our members and their families well into the future."" In February, the Company announced that it was investing $374 million in several of its Kokomo, Ind., facilities, including establishing a new manufacturing site in Tipton, Ind., to increase production capacity of the nine-speed transmission. Toledo Machining currently produces torque converters for Kokomo Transmission (Ind.), Indiana Transmission I and II (Kokomo, Ind.), Sterling Heights Assembly (Mich.), and Toluca (Mex.). The plant also produces steering columns for the following assembly plants: Warren Truck (Mich.), Belvidere (Ill.), Sterling Heights (Mich.), Toledo Assembly Complex (Ohio); Windsor (Ont.), Toluca (Mex.), Saltillo (Mex.), Arab American Vehicles (Egypt) and Carabobo (Venezuela).

Last year, Akerson saw his pay jump by 44 percent to $11.1 million, including $1.99 million in restricted stock as salary units, which vest immediately.

"Report: Boston bombers were tracked using Mercedes mbrace [w/video] Filed under: Performance , Government/Legal , Technology , Mercedes-Benz , Luxury We now know Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers said to be behind the Boston Marathon bombings, planned to head for New York City to detonate more improvised explosive devices. As it turns out, that plan was foiled by the quick thinking of one Mercedes-Benz owner, diligent police work and the Mercedes-Benz mbrace system. When the brothers carjacked a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as ""Danny,"" they didn't realize his Mercedes-Benz M-Class was equipped with the mbrace system, which can call for help in the event of an accident or track the vehicle in the event of a theft. According to reports, the Tsarnaev brothers held Danny hostage for nearly 90 minutes while they drove around Boston forming a plan until they had to stop for fuel. When one of the brothers went inside to pay, the other put his gun down for a moment. Danny took the opportunity to unlatch his seat belt, open the door and run to another nearby gas station, where he told the owner to call the police. When police arrived, they used the mbrace system to track the SUV after receiving Danny's permission, and it wasn't long before a shootout between police and the brothers ensued. When it was over, the eldest brother lay dead in the street. For more on the story, view the video report available below .

Until we stop all immigration from Muslim countries, events like this will continue to happen daily. Of course, the communists (liberals) like Obama fully support these scumbags. These people, combined with the 47% urban leeches, are the Democratic voting base. The growing threat of Islam is coming from within, and if we don't put a stop to it, soon we will find ourselves under a communist Marxist Islamic Jihadist rule (which is Obama's plan) soon. The Democrats have always been the party which supports extremist Islam. The fact that they ended the Iraq war (hich we began against an extremist Muslim dictator who supported the 9/11 terrorists who planned to use WMDs on America) proves that they support this communist Islamic agenda. They also HATE Israel, and want to wipe it and it's people off the map, andreplace it with ""Palestine"". They have the audacity to support a MOSQUE at ground 0, and now they are whining about the ""Miranda rights"" of this terrorist. Until we vote for a REAL conservative like Bachmann, Santorum, Rubio, or West, America will continue to die and be replaced by a communist Muslim stye.

Teaching them the finer points of the drive-by shooting probably shouldn't be one of them. That didn't stop 43-year-old Susan Becker piling her two teenage children into a car along with another teenage friend, arming the lot with pellet and BB guns and encouraging her posse to fire on parked cars. Becker bought the toys for her 13-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter, and a 15-year-old friend tagged along for the ride. All told, the team damaged at least 60 cars in and around Long Island as they fired from Becker's minivan. Police received reports from Islandia, Hauppauge and Commack communities, and some residents reported their windows smashed. Law enforcement used surveillance video to identify Becker's minivan and arrested the woman for multiple crimes, including endangering the welfare of a child and criminal mischief.

The new car's revelation at the 2013 Monaco F1 Grand Prix will be followed by a series of other dynamic demonstrations at events such as July's Festival of Speed at Goodwood, England.

Those are just a tiny number of the changes in the new monsters from Mercedes-Benz . You can find out enough about them in the two videos and three press releases below to become a certified dealer. New set-up for Unimog and Econic Strong new image for globally unique concepts - Unimog and Econic: Cleaner, more efficient, more powerful - BlueEfficiency Power engine generation with four-cylinder and six cylinder engines from 115 kW (156 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp) - Powerful and environmentally acceptable: Thoroughly renewed with state-of-the-art drive technology, control concept and cab - Unimog: New unique synergetic traction drive sets new standards in competition - Econic: Up to 4 percent lower fuel consumption - Econic: same payload despite Euro VI World premieres from Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks: A Unimog product range with ten new models at one go  from the Unimog U 216 to the Unimog U 5024  and 2 and 3-axle versions for the Econic low-entry specialists vehicle introduce the era of Euro VI engines also for special vehicles. All this is combined with an appreciable increase in performance, efficiency and easy operation. Despite the challenges arising from the Euro VI emission standards involving additional components and an increased volume of 120 litres, it has been possible to retain and improve the concept advantages of the two vehicle product ranges. As the new Europe-wide Euro VI emission standards will be valid from 1 January 2014, Mercedes-Benz is rounding off its range of commercial vehicles including the Atego, Antos, Arocs and Actros by launching the two special vehicle product ranges Unimog and Econic to comply with the new regulations. The new engines have up to 90 percent fewer exhaust gas and particulate matter emissions than those used up to now. New structures for the Unimog product range In the new set-up for the Unimog implement carriers, the Unimog U 216 and U 218 replace the previous Unimog U 20 as compact entry-level models and are getting closer to the versions with stronger engines now known as U 318, U 423, U 430, U 527 and U 530. Here the first number denotes the size (for instance 4 corresponds to the current Unimog U 400), the following two numbers stand for the first two numbers of horse-power performance, for example 23 for 230 hp. They are all being launched with, amongst other things, a completely redesigned panoramic cab, new work and power hydraulics systems as well as synergetic traction drive which allows changing over from manual transmission to hydrostatic transmission while driving and all of these innovations make an appreciable difference to the efficiency of the Unimog. The extremely mobile off-road Unimog U 4000 und U 5000 have also been given a more advanced design in important details and are now known under the reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023. For the Econic  the 2 and 3-axle chassis versions now as 4x2, 6x4 and 6x2/4 with electronically steered forward and trailing axles  the concept of the low-entry cab has now been given more potential with a great number of important ergonomic innovations. In addition, it is clearly more cost-effective as it has reduced its fuel consumption and repair and maintenance costs. However the payload remains the same despite the Euro VI. Facing the future efficiently with BlueEfficiency Power Two BlueEfficiency Power model series engines with radically new designs ensure that the Unimog complies with Euro VI emission standards and is also much more efficient especially when using implements as here greater output is available. The Econic has also been given two engines from this generation: engine types OM 934 and OM 936 with three 4-cylinder and two 6-cylinder versions and performances ranging from 115 kW (156 hp) to 260 kW (354 hp) with cubic capacities of 5.1 litres and 7.7 litres. The state-of-the-art drive units combine low fuel consumption with extremely clean exhaust gas and ensure that the Unimog is on the road altogether more efficiently despite the great amount of effort invested in its construction to ensure that it complies with Euro VI. For the Econic it has been possible to achieve up to four percent lower fuel consumption. The engines - already successfully used in the Antos and Atego - are very convincing with their improved output and torque and clearly increased acceleration over the whole transmission range. Despite the Euro VI the fuel consumption of the Unimog has also been reduced. High-tech drive units from a state-of-the-art engine generation The new solenoid injectors with ten-hole jets provide the best possible injection for every working situation. These new, long-stroke engines with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and a specific engine output of up to 33.8 kW/l (46 hp/l) are among the most effective diesel units. The new 5.1 litre 4-cylinder version also produces a convincing top torque of 650 Nm for the entry-level model Unimog U 216 with 115 kW (156 hp) which remains constant over the whole of the main transmission range from 1200 to 1600 rpm. The six-cylinder gives a powerful performance The performance spectrum of the big 7.7 litre in-line 6-cylinder OM 936 follows directly on the heels of the extremely compact four-cylinder version. It is used in both the U 427 and U 430 as well as the U 527 and U 530 and here for both versions with 200 kW (272 hp) or 220 kW (299 hp). This means that the Unimog has been given top-level motorisation. The best torque result lies at 1200 Nm for the 1200 to 1600 speed range. The Econic has been fitted with 6â??cylinder engines providing an output of 220 kW (299 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp). Economy of space on compact chassis Great importance was also attached to economy of space when complying with the exhaust gas cleaning standards required by Euro VI which comes into force on 1 January 2014. This was a task which faced the designers with demanding challenges considering the compact chassis of the Unimog vehicles and also the low-entry concept of the Econic. In addition to the recirculation of the exhaust gas inside the engine, cleaning the exhaust gas also involves a system comprising the oxidation catalytic converter, a closed particulate matter filter, AdBlue injection and an SCR catalytic converter connected in a series. - END - New set-up for Unimog and Econic Unimog U 4023 and U 5023: Setting standards for off-road mobility - Perfection off-road, better handling with centrally-positioned engine - New BlueEfficiency Power Euro VI engines with higher output and higher torque - Chassis concept with torsionally flexible frame, torque tubes and coil springs retained - Strong and reliable, many details improved - New engine power take-off with increased applications The outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog with its new reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023 as the follow-up models for the U 4000 and U 5000 is now more environmentally acceptable and efficient, but still just as mobile off the road as its predecessors and even stronger  that means better all round. It is fitted with the new four-cylinder BlueEfficiency Power BlueTec 6 engine with an output of 170 kW (230 hp) and a strong torque of 900 Nm. The Unimog transmission has been improved and uprated so that the gear changing times are shorter with an increased life span. In future the gears will be changed using the pitman arm on the steering column and this also includes the electronic quick reverse function (EQR). As up to now, there are eight forward and six reverse gears available as well as the optional crawler gears for off-road use with a speed range between 2.5-35 km/h. The main difference between the two big Unimog vehicles lies in their axles and frames i.e. their axle loads and the gross vehicle weights which is a maximum of 10.3 tonnes for the U 4023 and 14.5 tonnes for the U 5023. Time-tried cab with a short bonnet radically reworked This cab is first class  it has left its mark on the appearance of the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog since 1974. The designing engineers were confronted with the challenging task of installing technology complying with Euro VI and they succeeded by repositioning the engine one metre further back under the cab and this is now the core of the new concept. In comparison with its predecessor, the new cab has been lengthened by 120 mm and is slightly higher  and by moving the transmission controls from the central console to the pitman arm on the steering column there is much more space in the interior of the cab. This cab has also been upgraded with its new fittings: The multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column, pitman arm control, multifunction touch-keys and instrument cluster with a large display as well as a new stronger heating and ventilation system provide the very best conditions for the driver. The central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" has been redesigned so that the correct tire pressure for the prevailing conditions can be chosen simply and easily in the display with the pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". From the outside the dynamic design of the radiator and the new bumpers with modern headlamps show at the first glance that here there is a new generation of the Unimog on the job. Also the access to the cab is completely new with easy to master and safe steps, two or three depending on what the customer requires. The altered position of the engine also allows power to be taken directly from the engine with an engine-driven PTO so that implements can be run independently of the driving situation unlike the transmission-driven PTOs which are still available. The big advantages of the extremely mobile off-road Unimog such as its outstanding handling over tough terrain remain untouched and in individual points its strengths have been improved. In the new model, the curving of the frame is now further back due to the central position of the engine and altogether the Unimog has a lower centre of gravity while retaining its high ground clearance which is extremely important for off-road operations. As both frame and tubular cross members are welded, this guarantees the extremely good torsional flexibility of up to 600 mm when driving cross-country. The axle articulation of up to 30° is made possible by the torque tube technology combined with the coil springs by connecting the torque tube and the torque ball to the transmission. Portal axles, the low centre of gravity and extremely good angles of approach and departure (at the front 44°, at the rear 51°), and ramp angles (34°) as well as its slope climbing ability (45°) all go to make the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog just what it is  and in addition there is its fording ability of a maximum of 1200 mm as well as its side tilting angle of 38°. Driving in extreme situations is supported by the engageable all-wheel drive, engageable differential locks and the central tire inflation system. Unimog vehicles have a long life and they are robust and reliable. The completely welded frame and the enclosed parts of the chassis stand for the claim that the vehicle is able to stand up to great stress and strain. The axles are reinforced, all important power units and equipment are metal clad or installed in safe positions  and this is also true for fording ability within the guaranteed depth of 1200 mm. Extreme operations the world over All this shows quite clearly just why the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog has such an excellent reputation all over the world. Working in extreme off-road conditions is the order of the day, whether it is fighting forest fires, for disaster control, crane operations, pipeline construction, expeditions, rescuing man and machine and last but not least for transporting crews and other people  in remote areas where the roads turn into bad tracks and rough terrain, that is where the Unimog U 4023 and U 5023 are on home ground. The Unimog is also looked after perfectly as far as maintenance, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned as competent Unimog Dealers are there to take care of the vehicles in over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries where special service packages and financial services round off the customer care. - END - Unimog U 216 to Unimog U 530: New powerful implement carriers - New entry models Unimog U 216 and U 218 - Work and power hydraulics - World premiere: Smooth changeover from driving with hydrostatic traction drive to manual transmission precisely designed for the job - Unimog versatility: Over 1000 implements and applications The product range of the Unimog implement carrier launched in 2000 is now being presented in the second generation with a new arrangement and new designations. U 216 and U 218 as entry-level models and the U 318 and U 423 are fitted with four-cylinder engines, U 427, U 430 and U 527 as well as U 530 have six-cylinder units. As the end of very work-intensive design engineering, the Unimog implement carriers are now once again at the starting block  more efficient, environmentally acceptable and cost-effective than their predecessors and in addition with their typical features greatly strengthened. New exterior: Panoramic cab with a modern design The panoramic cab presents itself in a new and modern design. Here the optical and functional effect of the short bonnet is emphasised even more by LED lamps including daytime running lamps integrated in the bumpers. To improve visibility, the windscreen wipers have now been fitted on the roof over the windscreen giving a superb view of both road and implements, and improved even more through the new front camera monitor system. Typical for the Unimog: The front power take-off reveals its powerful technology and power-hungry implements. New interior: Operating concept provides the best working conditions Multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column and stronger heating and cooling system with improved air flow make both drivers and co-drivers feel happy. The operating controls have been improved so that there is now a steering column pitman arm to operate driving functions such as gear changing or engine brake. The instrument cluster for driver information is new and has a large, light display; the joystick for operating implements can be removed and held in the hand; the uninterrupted view of the front implements  which is also important when attaching or removing them  is made safer with the monitor and front camera; and all this adds up to an appreciable lightening of the driver's load. Using the central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" (optional) is now much easier via the display as it gives the user the choice between pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". New work hydraulics  more sensitive than ever The new work hydraulics set to precisely and without making any jerking movements  with at the same time about 30 percent increased hydraulic performance. This makes is possible to control the implements more sensitively than ever before. The work hydraulics is completely proportional when working and allows two movements to be performed at the same time via the joystick. The multifunction keys on the steering wheel and the display allow the output to be limited. The hydraulics works with two circuits, whereby Circuit I provides 200 bar system pressure with hydraulic oil flow of 32 l/min, together with Circuit II it adds up to an additional 55 l/min with up to 240 bar. And here the implement drive has been improved even further as the front power take-off now gives a performance of a maximum of 160 kW (up to now 150 kW). New compact entry models: Unimog U 216 and Unimog U 218 The two entry-level models U 216 und U 218 are completely new. They replace the previous Unimog U 20 and are now very little different from the bigger implement carriers above them starting with the U 318. Models U 216 and U 218 also have the same panoramic cab including the adjustable steering column and the other innovations, as well as the well-known unique VarioPilot where steering wheel and pedals can be moved to the other side of the cab when the operator needs to work from the co-driver's seat. The great advantage of the new models is their size with extremely compact dimensions. The wheelbase is only 2800 mm and is thus 200 mm shorter than the U 318, the turning circle is only 12.6 metres in comparison with 13.7 metres  by the way both of these turning circles are what are to be expected of passenger cars. Power is provided by the four-cylinder engines with 115 kW (156 hp) and 130 kW (177 hp). With three different load ratings from 7.5 to 10 tonnes, the payload of the U 216 and U 218 can cope with a great variety of tasks and applications. Unimog U 318 to U 530 Even greater performance, more manoeuvrable, more agile and able to do many more different kinds of job: such an all-round increase in efficiency is the trade mark of the Unimog U 318 to U 530. The engines produce a new peak performance as the 220 kW (299 hp) in the U 430 and U 530 provide the strongest hp output ever realised for a Unimog. The advanced work and power hydraulic systems profit a great deal from the engines. Greater efficiency is also provided by the greater payload. Here it was possible to reduce the weight by making savings on the frame and using aluminium wheels. It was also a brilliant feat to be able to shorten the wheelbase by 80 mm in comparison with the former U 300 despite the complicated components needed for Euro VI (U 318 and U 423). Because of this and with the help of a greater turning angle when steering, the turning circle is clearly smaller than that of its predecessor. New power hydraulics replaces power take-off pumps and special purpose body engines Power hydraulics VarioPower  for a long time this name has been behind the extremely powerful implement drive in the Unimog. Now it is even more efficient. Two circuits, each with 125 litres of hydraulic flow and 280 bar pressure can perform, if required, several different kinds of job at the same time or one especially sensitive operation  up to a top performance of 58 kW per circuit. This advanced design replaces pumps attached to the power take-off or diesel body engines, for example for mounted sweeping machines and this saves fuel, space and weight. And if the power hydraulics is not needed, then the Unimog can save weight in the vehicle frame  it can simply be removed from its installation location to increase the payload. This new system is operated using steering wheel touch-keys and its data can be read in the display in the new instrument cluster. The power hydraulics is available in Unimog models from U 318 on. The new synergetic traction drive The innovative new hydrostatic traction drive for the Unimog implement carrier is also a world premiere and it opens up a whole new range of possibilities for using implements. The combination of hydrostatic and manual transmission allows the driver to change smoothly from one mode to the other while driving. Up to now it was necessary to halt briefly before changing systems. The new comfortable Drive-Work-Mode can be used to advantage, for instance, when mowing grass verges and the work is interrupted by a long noise barrier. The new hydrostatic drive now allows speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph) and the hydrostatic performance has been increased by 20 percent. Whereas infinitely variable driving and working reduces wear on the clutch and increases work performance, driving with the manual transmission saves fuel because of its increased efficiency. When using the electronic pneumatic power shift (EPS), the driver starts the changeover by pressing the clutch and so starts the optional automatic electronic drive control (EAS) to complete the changeover automatically. This new synergetic system is easily operated by using the steering column control switch, hydraulic joystick or alternatively the accelerator. Unimog implement-carrying design: More than a 1000 different possibilities The versatility of the Unimog implement carrier is legendary. In the meantime, more than a 1000 different possibilities are registered. Implement manufacturers worldwide work together intensively with Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks at the Wörth plant - where the Unimog now has its base  to expand the range of operations. The great advantage of the Unimog product range from U 216 to U 530 is its ability to use implements four-fold. There are three attachment points  front, rear and between the axles  as well as the space for mounting bodies and equipment on the chassis. The implements and equipment can be supplied with energy hydraulically, mechanically and electrically. The range of users includes Local Authorities, the energy sector, forestry workers, agricultural logistics, the construction industry or road-rail operators, but the list is long and includes many others. Whether it is working at the airport, cleaning solar parks or clearing snow across the mountains, virtually nothing is foreign to the Unimog and that it is exactly what makes it unique in the world of commercial vehicles - as a versatile implement carrier with the driving qualities of a truck. It also proves its value as a tractor unit with a 40 tonne combination and its technical top speed of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) is absolutely suitable for motorways. Directional stability, precise steering and the use of ABS are responsible for the high level of safety provided by the Unimog. In addition, the extremely good axle load distribution and four same-size wheels have a positive effect on the vehicle's handling qualities. And the Unimog sets its very own standards with the panoramic cab. The panoramic front windscreen, deep drawn down side windows and short bonnet give a very wide view of driving and working areas. What is quite new is the front camera system with a monitor which makes things easier for the driver as it shows him the area directly in front of the vehicle which makes it easier to attach implements. And last but not least, it is the good off-road mobility of the Unimog which speaks for itself: portal axles, high ground clearance, differential locks, single tires and the ability to rock out of dips (Electronic Quick Reverse). As far as servicing, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned, the Unimog is well provided for with over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries worldwide where competent Unimog Dealers are ready and waiting with special service offers as well as financial services to round off the entire package.

WEC Spa: Audi presents long-tail R18 -First fielding of three Audi R18 e-tron quattro cars -Premiere of a new aerodynamic variant -Last race preparation for the Le Mans 24 Hours Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Comparison in racing conditions: Two versions of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that, also visually, can be clearly distinguished from each other will be running at Spa. The winners of the opening round, Loïc Duval/Tom Kristensen/Allan McNish (F/DK/GB), and the current World Endurance Champions Marcel Fässler/André Lotterer/Benoît Tréluyer (CH/D/F), will be starting with the aerodynamic variant that was victorious at Silverstone. It generates optimal downforce for track types such as the 7.004-kilometer circuit at Spa. The third Audi R18 e-tron quattro, driven by Marc Gené/Lucas di Grassi/Oliver Jarvis (E/BR/GB), on the other hand uses an aero package that has been optimized for the high-speed Le Mans track and can be recognized by its lengthened rear section. The comparison, however, is not focused on absolute lap times. Instead, the team will analyze the time differences to be expected between both models on individual track sectors. In addition, practical aspects of using the second body version will be reviewed and data generated for the fielding in the race at Le Mans. The focal point of the spectators' interest will yet again be the thrilling battle between World Champion Audi and challenger Toyota. In the seven meetings that have taken place since last June, the score is at 4-3 for the sports cars from Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm in the competition with Japan. The Spa 6 Hours will be held on Saturday of the first weekend in May. The TV channel Eurosport will cover selected stages of the race whereas the full racing distance can be watched on audi-liveracing.com on the internet. - Will Duval/Kristensen/McNish be able to extend their lead of the standings? - How well will the World Champions Fässler/Lotterer/Tréluyer fare? - How will the battle with Toyota develop? - Which manufacturer will travel to Le Mans with a points advantage? Dr. Wolfgang Ullrich, Head of Audi Motorsport: ""As always, Audi will be using the race at Spa as a 'dress rehearsal' for the Le Mans 24 Hours in June. Spa is a race track with a character that's completely different from Silverstone. We thoroughly reviewed the first race of the season and accomplished our tasks in order to be well prepared for the second round of the WEC. Fielding the Le Mans aero variant on the third vehicle that hasn't been optimized for the lap times at Spa is an important element of the preparation for the 24-hour race."" Ralf Jüttner, Technical Director Audi Sport Team Joest: ""The comparison with our competitor will start from scratch again at Spa. We can expect our opponent Toyota to compete with the latest technological update. For the first time this year, we'll be running with three cars. That means more work for our team. Spa's a great track and a race that definitely belongs on the WEC calendar. The new Audi R18 e-tron quattro was immediately reliable and fast."" Facts and quotes by the Audi drivers Marcel Fässler (36/CH), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Drove the fastest race lap at Spa a year ago - Had to admit defeat at Silverstone by only 3.4 seconds ""Spa's one of my favorite tracks. In the LMP sports car, the circuit is a fantastic challenge. Eau Rouge, Blanchimont and the fast downhill double left-hand turn are particularly nice. Plus I like the ambience in Belgium extremely well."" André Lotterer (31/D), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Regards Spa as his 'home' track - Is the runner-up in the standings after the 2013 season opener ""I grew up in Belgium and went to the track as a child. That's why Spa is always special for me. It's a fast track that should be suiting our car well. My two team-mates really enjoy driving there too. I'm hoping for us to be able to reverse the order of the top two results of the Silverstone weekend."" Benoît Tréluyer (36/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Winner of the 2013 Sebring 12 Hours - The World Champion was the runner-up in Belgium last year ""For my team-mate André Lotterer, Spa is a 'home' track in a way. We'll be running for the first time now in this year's R18 e-tron quattro and the new tires on this track. Of course we'd like to be on the podium again right after Silverstone  ideally on the top though."" Loïc Duval (30/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the Spa 6 Hours in the Audi R18 ultra last year - Leads the standings with his team-mate after the success at Silverstone ""I achieved my first victory with Audi at Spa last year. In May, the weather in the Ardennes is often unstable. Together with Allan and Tom I'd like to repeat the success at Silverstone and extend our World Championship lead."" Tom Kristensen (45/DK), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - The Dane achieved his first victory of the season at Silverstone - Ten years ago, he won at Spa in the Audi R8 ""Spa for us drivers, the cars and the teams is a huge challenge. It's a typical track from a different era with many vertical differences and corresponding compressions, with blind turns and frequently changing weather. The mechanics and all the other team members did an outstanding job at Silverstone. The pit stops and strategy were good. Spa's our last preparation in racing conditions before the biggest competition of the year at Le Mans."" Allan McNish (43/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Achieved the fastest time in qualifying at Spa last year - At the WEC opener in England, celebrated his first victory in an R18 e-tron quattro ""I always enjoy driving again at Spa. The track follows the topography in an ideal way. That's a hallmark of many good circuits. Some of the world's nicest corners are found at Spa, such as Eau Rouge or Pouhon. The races there are always thrilling, partially due to the weather but also because there are always surprises. The track is rough on the drivers, the car and the tires. In addition, we're expecting the competition at Spa to be tough due to Toyota. We drivers and our engineers have found a very good rhythm of working together."" Marc Gené (39/E), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the race at Spa on making his Audi debut a year ago - Has celebrated three sports car victories at Spa since 2008 ""I'm looking forward to one of my favorite tracks that I've won at three times before. For us, it's the big preparation for Le Mans. The weather's often unpredictable. For Oliver Jarvis, Lucas di Grassi and me, it's the only opportunity to adjust to each other in racing conditions. Until now, I've only driven the Audi R18 e-tron quattro in tests. I'd like to repeat last year's victory."" Lucas di Grassi (28/BR), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Is starting his third sports car race with Audi - Was the runner-up in the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""I'm experiencing my first WEC race in 2013 at Spa. I've got fond memories of this legendary circuit from GP2 and Formula 1. There's no nicer track if you're running in a fast car. I'll be starting with two different team-mates than I did at Sebring. We'll be able to gear up now for the biggest task of the year in racing conditions."" Oliver Jarvis (29/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Celebrated a class victory with Audi at Daytona in January - Won the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""My sports car career in Audi's factory team began a year ago at Spa. We immediately took a podium. It's a great feeling to return now. After a good race at Sebring I'm traveling to Spa even better prepared than I was twelve months ago. For the first time, I'm running with my two new team-mates. And we're developing the car with special aerodynamics for Le Mans. That'll be our personal warm-up for the 24-hour race.""

There's no other place where you can feel the centrifugal forces within your body as much as you can in Eau Rouge. Spa is the second-longest track after Le Mans and the weather is always changeable in the Ardennes. Eau Rouge remains the greatest single challenge. In Formula 1, due to the smaller engines and lower weight, you run flat-out there but in the heavier sports car Eau Rouge is even more extreme. Good overtaking opportunities exist in La Source, in front of Les Combes, in the double left-hand turn, on the Fagnes passage and in the chicane before the start and finish. The tarmac provides outstanding grip which is why slicks even work well when the track is slightly damp. In 2012, I celebrated my third sports car victory on this track with my team-mates.""

I've seen them race in person and truly amazing. But when they said long tail, I had images of the 917 long tail that truly stuck out a good 18 inches on those rear extensions. Not quite there, but still cool. Also, from the speculation last year, I got the feeling the top speed at Le Mans was due to the hybrid motors on the front axle bogging them down a bit at absolute top speed with extra mechanical drag? As I admit, that was speculation though. Maybe aero really was the limiting factor. Yesterday at 9:48 PM Report abuse Permalink Vorsprung durch Tecknik.

The plan is to complete all three of the Special Stages on the first day and then run in portions of the distance on the ensuing three days depending on how the pack fares (there are no Blink stations in southern Baja, as far as we know). Check out NORRA's press release and a short video about the SRI EV1 below . NORRA ""FORGES THE FUTURE"" THIS WEEK VIA FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC OFF-ROAD RACE CAR TO CHALLENGE THE LEGENDARY BAJA PENNINSULA Since 1967, the National Off Road Racing Association's (NORRA) Mexican 1000 has been a significant environment for creativity and innovation in off-road motorsports. Thanks to the technical and industry credibility of hot rod pioneer and NORRA executive Don Francisco, the unique Baja competition quickly rose to prominence via the participation of stars like of Parnelli Jones, James Garner and Steve McQueen. Why? From its inception desert racing's wide-open environment gave the automotive industry a new forum for brilliant innovators like Vic Hickey to create the original ""Baja Boot"" and the legendary Olds 442 ""Banshee"". That unique hot rodding legacy will return in a wholly unique way as NORRA today announced the entry of the first ever all-electric off-road race car, the SRI EV1 into this week's four-day General Tire Mexican 1000 rally. The fourth annual vintage-flavored on and off-road rally is scheduled to begin on Saturday, April 27 with a pre-event technical inspection, vehicle display and driver's meeting all taking place at the historic bullring in Mexicali, Baja, Mexico. A record field of 150-plus entries (up from 95 last year) will be made up of motorcycle, truck, buggy and sedan classes from an international list of entries, with a unique emphasis on vintage machinery and a distinctive spotlight on hospitality, adventure and fun. The EV1 is a full scale, 100% electric-powered race car built to resemble a modern Class 1 unlimited open-wheel machine. Designed by SRI, SRD and EV West, the car produces 535 HP and 750 ft-lbs of torque. Power is delivered through two 9"" Netgain WarP motors controlled via Evnetics Soliton 1 high performance controllers before being delivered to the dirt via a Mendeola S4D sequential gearbox. Team SRI's goal for the 1,200-plus mile Mexican 1000 is to successfully complete all three of the Special Stages on Day 1 from the start in Mexicali to the first overnight stop at Bahia De Los Angeles before running on portions of the remaining Special Stages throughout the event that fall within the EV1's range. This includes the final ""Secret Stage"" on Day 4 that precedes the official finish line at land's end in San Jose Del Cabo. Structured in a rally format instead of the more tradition, non-stop Baja endurance competition, the NORRA Mexican 1000 offers Team SRI a unique opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the EV1 thanks its multi-day schedule and a series of off-road Special Stages linked via on-road transit sections. Not surprisingly, the new EV1 is a one-of-a-kind hybrid that combines proven off-road racing technology with a cutting edge drivetrain. The Brenthel Industries chassis features a ride controlled by Bilstein Black Hawk 9300 series shocks on BFG Baja TA KR 35x12.50x15 tires balanced and protected with Ride-On TPS on Method Racing Wheels. Driver and co-driver ride in MasterCraft seats and harnesses. Power for the motors is stored in 138, 3.3v 180ah China Aviation Lithium Batteries (CALB) in two ""hot swap"" battery packs each containing 69 cells. Additional power for the car's Racepak, Baja Designs lighting, communications and GPS is provided by a 4-cell battery pack located in the driver's compartment. Total energy stored in the battery packs is 82kWh, enough to power an average home for about a week. ""This is a monumental undertaking that has been 18 solid months in the making,"" explained Strategic Recovery Institute founder Jeffrey Smith. ""Our entire team is excited about what we are stepping forward to do. We are confident that our upcoming Mexican 1000 capabilities demonstration will generate future battery sponsorship to allow the ability to 'hot swap' multiple battery packs andcomplete entire races in the near future."" The unique legacy of the General Tire NORRA Mexican 1000 to motivate and inspire is still alive and well. Like the unique mid-engine four-wheel drive Baja Boot that Vic Hickey built in the 30 days prior to the inaugural NORRA Mexican 1000 in 1967, the SRI EV1 will become living proof that innovation with an eye toward the future is a powerful concept that may never become obsolete. # # # ABOUT THE GENERAL TIRE NORRA MEXICAN 1000 Dubbed the ""Happiest Race on Earth,"" the unique off-road rally was co-created by promoter Mike Pearlman in 2010. Running this year from April 26 - May 1, each day of the rally consists of special stages (unlimited speed timed stages in the dirt) linked together by controlled speed liaison / transit sections (highway). The one-of-a-kind, once-a-year, four-day rally includes vintage off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rally cars, a limited group of modern desert racecars and classes for prerunner trucks and buggies. Pearlman's late father Ed and others established the first running of the NORRA Mexican 1000 off-road rally in November of 1967, which eventually became internationally recognized and evolved into the Baja 1000 in the mid-1970s. The NORRA Mexican 1000 is supported by General Tire, American Racing Wheel, South Point Hotel Casino, Walker Evans Racing, Azunia Tequila, KC HiLites, Bistein Shock Absorbers and Mastercraft/I mpact Safety. baja , baja 1000 , electric car , electric vehicle , ev , general tire mexican 1000 , national off road racing association , norra , off-road , rally , sr1 ChooseControl: Find Your Dream Car *0 / 3000 Character Maximum 0:43 - ""...You step on the gas...""...err....juice? 21 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Yesterday at 7:16 PM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to HVH20's comment It was fabricated by SRD (Strategic Racing Designs), with from EV West, for SRI (Strategic Recovery Institute).

RIP I don't know if enough of others agree and I guess I'll see by the downvotes but it's concerning me that autoblog is posting anything news relevant with cars. I don't know if I'm one of the few but I come here to get away from tragic news, to enjoy my hobby and get away from politics and the real world which is cruel and ruthless at times. Now anything related to cars, whether it's a death, rape, accident, what next, drive by? and it gets a space here. Why? Is that really automotive news? At first I could somewhat understand the youtube finds even though I don't click them I figure they are light hearted but to come on here and read serious news just because there is a car involved or car in the background just doesn't seem right and doesn't seem fitting. And it's getting more and more space too. There are so many other places for news and tragedies around the world, do we really need to see it plastered here as well in the guise of car news?

I will say I'm disappointed at Autoblog's article, though. It seems disingenuous to plaster a huge Nissan logo on the story, and call it ""the second death at the plant in recent years"" (with the undertone of suggesting that the plant is unsafe) when neither death seems to have actually been related to Nissan's procedures or the plant itself. The first one was a truck accident, and the more recent one was a contractor working for another company that 'makes paint systems for Nissan' and was probably in the process of installing the large electric panel that fell. The third article also mentions another accident where a supplier was seriously injured while repairing a machine. All of these things SUCK, but they don't seem to show the plant is unsafe.

The worker had worked there for over 20 years,and was near retirement age. He is also a huge man. I think the company no doubt saw him as a liability. He was outspoken about stuff too which didn\'t help matters. I just thought this was sorry as all get out esp. considering the man has also lost his Dad and a young grandson in the last year or so.

Yesterday at 12:55 PM Report abuse Permalink Good to see the Japanese government coming out on the side of the consumer, well done. Mitusbishi just seem so corrupt and rotten it runs rife right though the company, the products design are totally yuk (Pig ugly L200 Triton just so very unpractical, no rear double cab headroom is totally the most useless gormless pick-up truck ever designed). I know folk that have had crankshaft pulley's sheared right off, Mitsubishi just don't want to know, fix the problem whilst still under guarantee, its like trying to ""squeeze blood out of a stone"" process trying to get them to fix anything that is a design flaw and their fault. To now hear they are not being proactive at coming foreword with vital recall information, it just does not surprise me one bit. Used to love their old products like the big boxy spacious practical 7 seater tough bomp proof Pajaro, that used to do so well winning Dakar rally year after year with some really great robust products in the past. Its a shame to see the absolutely abysmal products they put out today, they have very little to offer no wonder they are sinking fast. Yesterday at 10:13 AM Report abuse Permalink The Tri-Star? Why do writers try so hard to come up with cute pet names for Mitsubishi? The name means three diamonds, not stars. It isn\'t the Diamond-Star company either. The vehicle has problems because of the batteries. The batteries come from the same company that makes the batteries that is keeping the Boeing Dreamliners grounded. Yesterday at 10:09 AM Report abuse Permalink Of the smaller Japanese automakers, I respect Mitsubishi and Subaru, because they have kept their factories open in America and still employ people here. I do not respect Mazda, because they shut down their U.S. operations, laid off the workers and are now building a factory in Mexico. Mazda lost me when they did that - it's like spit in the face to the U.S. worker. Some people go out of their way to buy cars that are not built by Americans, so Mazda must be tailoring to that crowd now. Mitsubishi cars are actually very highly rated by Consumer Reports for their reliability and the Outlander Sport (built in the U.S.) recently won the Automotive Science Group Award for best overall small SUV on the market today. The Outlander Sport SE AWD is also the only SUV listed in the 2013 Consumer Reports car buying guide for the best picks in the ""under $25,000"" category. I think Mitsubishi has a marketing problem here in the United States that they need to overcome. Overall, MItsubishi is posting good profits worldwide these days, but they need to build more to tastes in the U.S. to survive here. For starters, they need to change the front grill of the new 2014 Outlander back to the Lancer jet fighter grill, instead of the new look. Maybe I'm out in left field with that opinion, but the new front grill just looks odd and will take away from all of the good changes that they made throughout the rest of the vehicle. Yesterday at 10:08 AM Report abuse Permalink Mitsubishi, as a car company, has been in a slow decline after the breakup with Chrysler. Although the two companies came up with a few very good products, neither had the depth of resources to make the alliance really work. Chrysler has found Fiat, and the merger seems to be working well for both as Fiat has a lot to offer and Chrysler has always been just short of being more than competitive across the market range with one or two ""best in class"" vehicles among a few also ran offerings. Right now the ""Three Diamond"" company has nothing to offer in a merger and I believe they will sell off their commercial vehicle operations and slowly go off into the sun set. I also believe that the Japanese automotive ranks will be thinned out some more as American and other Asian companies eat into their market.

"Tesla announces 'World's Best Service and Warranty Program,' hints at future 500-mile battery Filed under: EV/Plug-in , Tesla Motors , USA Tesla Motors has just revealed the latest edition of it 5-part announcement trilogy . Whereas the previous first installment had to do with the company's new leasing program , this episode is all about service and warranty, comes gift-wrapped in the glittery descriptor of ""World's Best,"" and is accompanied by hints of a future battery upgrade. The new plan improves on the California automaker's service program by adding a valet service that brings you a top-spec Model S Performance - or a Tesla Roadster , if you prefer - to temporarily replace your personal vehicle while it's being serviced. CEO Elon Musk states that this fleet of Model S service vehicles, which will initially number about 100, will ideally be less than three months old and also be available for immediate sale. Like your loaner more than your own car? You can keep it, paying ""a price that is lower by 1% per month of age and $1 per mile"" for your new ride and taking, likely, a similar hit on your trade-in. Musk hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. Not only should the purchase scheme keep the loaner fleet nice and fresh, it may also create a cache of certified pre-owned inventory for buyers who are looking for a deal on a Tesla that starts at $69,900 from the factory, or who would rather not wait a couple months for a new, made-to-order car. As well as no-travel hassle, Tesla has also made its $600 annual service optional without effecting the standard 5-year/50,000-mile warranty. The company has also made the battery portion of the warranty unconditional, meaning that, if you manage to somehow turn it into a useless brick (something that should be quite difficult to accomplish with the Model S ), you will get a replacement unit of equal capacity free of charge. Speaking of battery capacity, during the media call, Mr. Musk also offered some hope for those anxious for packs that hold more energy than the current EPA-estimated 265-mile/85 kilowatt-hour packs now available. In response to a question about upcoming technology improvements, he hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. He then added that, eventually, Tesla would likely offer owners the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles with longer-range capabilities. It all sounds pretty good to us, and we can't help but think if this upstart company keeps it up, surpassing sales of the Chevy Volt might seem a minor accomplishment. For more details on this newest warranty arrangement, you can get more details in a blog post on the Tesla website .

It is a lot for regular middle-class folks like us. BUT, the car wasn't made for us. It was made for people who would buy a top-of-the-line Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, etc. Being that Tesla is a brand new company, they've been forced to make their first several models to appeal to only those people who can afford ultra high-end sports cars and luxury sedans (ie. The Roadster and Model S, respectively). This was done because they didn't have enough capitol to roll out the 50,000 vehicles it would've needed to do in order to satisfy that kind of demand. So they started out appealing to the ultra rich on the Roadster and used the capitol on those sales to create the S class. That capitol also allowed them to purchase a state-of-the-art factory and the ability to ramp up production. Now their using the capitol from the S sales to ramp up supercharging stations throughout the US to answer the range issues. They're also coming out with a sport utility version of the S next year and will parley those sales in order to make a much cheaper sedan (comparable to perhaps a BMW i series). The hope is to finally make a sedan perhaps closer to a Toyota Camry. But they will first need to scale up to the type of factory infrastructure that GM, Ford & Chrysler has in order to be able to compete and match the supply with the demand (which is VERY challenging for a small start-up). That being said; if they keep making a quality product, they will be very successful. And deservedly so. As for range being an issue. I think 265-300 miles of range for an electric car that can be charged at night while your sleeping for 75% less than gasoline is AWESOME! DOT statistics show that most people don't drive more than 20 miles per day. On the occasion that you have to take a long trip, there is (and will be many more) supercharging stations with which to charge up. So if you can afford it. My opinion is... Nothing beats this car. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jonathan's comment Tesla and their battery source have run out of money.

You have already been corrected many times so that means that you are actively creating FUD. Every one of your statements about Tesla can be proven wrong with a minimal amount of research. You are a troll. You are trying to create misinformation. Tesla received all of their loan and are actively paying it back. They have not and will not be asking for any more Federal money. You think you'd be trolling a Ford website since they received 12 times more Federal money than Tesla did. Ford got $5.9 billion for their loan that they will be repaying over the next 25 years! Tesla has vowed to pay back their loan in 5 years. They are currently paying back $15 million every three months with $30 million paid so far. Continued success means that they will continue to pay down the loan. But you are so afraid of them that you would prefer they fail to fit your sick and twisted agenda of fear.

"Official: 2014 Toyota 4Runner revealed at Stagecoach Music Festival [UPDATE: w/video] Filed under: SUV , Videos , Toyota , Design/Style Toyota has just pulled the sheet off its updated 2014 4Runner at the 2013 Stagecoach Music Festival near Palm Springs, California. Toyota is the title sponsor at the festival, and claims that this is the first-ever global reveal of a new automobile at a major music festival. We're also guessing this is the first time that the 4Runner has seen duty inside what looks like a vintage circus act's cage . We can see from the photos that the body-on-frame SUV has received a freshened look with new smoked light fixtures front and rear, along with a boldly reworked front fascia and grille. The profile view seems largely unchanged, though there are new wheel patterns on offer. The 4Runner will continue to be offered in three trims, including SR5, more luxurious Limited, and off-road-ready Trail specification. Both 4x2 and both part- and full-time 4x4 models will continue to be available, all will be powered by the same 4.0-liter 270-horsepower V6 and five-speed automatic as last year. Other changes for the 2014 model year include a retouched interior featuring new Optitron gauges, a multi-information display, and changes in trim. On the entertainment front, there are new head units with Toyota's Entune infotainment technology and an in-glass antenna replacing the previous mast unit. The optional navigation unit features a seven-inch screen.

We're also guessing this is the first time that the 4Runner has seen duty inside what looks like a vintage circus act's cage . We can see from the photos that the body-on-frame SUV has received a freshened look with new smoked light fixtures front and rear, along with a boldly reworked front fascia and grille. The profile view seems largely unchanged, though there are new wheel patterns on offer. The 4Runner will continue to be offered in three trims, including SR5, more luxurious Limited, and off-road-ready Trail specification. Both 4x2 and both part- and full-time 4x4 models will continue to be available, all will be powered by the same 4.0-liter 270-horsepower V6 and five-speed automatic as last year. Other changes for the 2014 model year include a retouched interior featuring new Optitron gauges, a multi-information display, and changes in trim. On the entertainment front, there are new head units with Toyota's Entune infotainment technology and an in-glass antenna replacing the previous mast unit. The optional navigation unit features a seven-inch screen. Check out our gallery above and the official press release below for the full scoop. : A video has been added below to go with the press release. Enjoy! Related Gallery 2014 Toyota 4Runner New 2014 4Runner Features Rugged Exterior Design To Match Its Authentic Off-Road Heritage -Added Interior Refinement; Two- or three-row versatility -Body-On-Frame Off-Road Performance -Advanced audio and connectivity features TORRANCE, Calif., April 27, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- For nearly three decades, the Toyota 4Runner mid-size SUV has been a stalwart for off-roading enthusiasts seeking a SUV with rugged, go-anywhere capability. Currently in its fifth-generation, 4Runner continues as one of the few fully capable mid-size SUVs, and the redesigned 2014 4Runner receives a rugged new exterior design, and interior refinements that add comfort and convenience without sacrificing its hallmark performance capability and excellent value. The 4Runner combines rugged body-on-frame construction with comprehensive suspension technology that yields optimal off-road capability with a smooth ride and comfort more often associated with crossovers. The 2014 4Runner is available in three grades: a well-equipped, value-driven SR5; top-of-the-line Limited, and a Trail grade for those who want maximum off-road capability. Optional third-row seats on SR5 and Limited allow for up to seven-person capacity. 4Runner owners will have the choice of a rear wheel 4x2, part-time 4x4 or a full-time multi-mode 4x4 with a locking center differential. All models are equipped with a powerful 4.0-liter, 270-horsepower V6 teamed to a five-speed ECT-i automatic transmission and one of the few vehicles that continues to offer a transfer case. 4Runner's Rugged Exterior Design Projects Its Off-Road Heritage With a Premium Refinement The refreshed 4Runner features a redesigned front fascia that conveys a more rugged and aggressive appearance. This includes a muscular front grille, and edgier smoked headlamps for a more forceful look. The SR5 and Trail grades feature a color-keyed grille insert and front bumper that is surrounded by fog lamps set in sharply cut inlays that extend from the headlamps down to the bumper. The Trail grade features new color-keyed bumpers and overfenders, and it continues to be distinguished by an aggressive hood scoop and silver painted front and rear bumper accents. All grades are now standard with a roof rack. In addition to the distinctive new grille, the premium Limited's front design stands apart with a chrome-plated grille insert and chrome front bumper that extends to the fog-lamp bezels. The side molding, roof rack and rear bumper are also chrome trimmed. The headlamps have also changed from halogen to projector beam, with both the headlamps and redesigned rear combination lamps on all 4Runner grades now featuring LED lamps. Both the SR5 and Trail grades will ride on 17-inch alloy wheels with a new wheel-design for both, while the Limited continues to ride on 20-inch alloy wheels, which are now painted black prior to machining to add contrast. All grades continue to come standard with a full-size spare. The 2014 4Runner will be available in eight exterior colors that include new additions: Super White; Attitude Black Metallic; Barcelona Red Metallic; and Nautical Blue Metallic. They will join carryover colors that include: Blizzard Pearl; Classic Silver Metallic; Magnetic Gray Metallic; and Black. New Interior Styling Has a refined style with the Comfort expected of a Mid-size SUV The 4Runner exterior updates are complemented by touches of refinement on the inside. Both the SR5 and Trail grade add standard Soft Touch door trim, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather shift knob provide a premium feel and atmosphere. The SR5 receives a new bright and highly visible Optitron instrument panel that houses speedometer, tachometer, voltage, fuel and coolant temperature gauges, plus a multi-information display that offers multiple functions. An Eco-Driving feedback system allows the driver to monitor fuel consumption in real time. On 4Runner Trail, an overhead console within easy reach organizes the off-road control switches into one location. A compass indicator and outside temperature display add functionality. A manually controlled air conditioning system is standard on SR5 and Trail grades; the Limited features an automatic dual-zone climate-control system. For second-row passengers, a sculpted front seat-back shape provides additional knee space. The second-row seats, which include a center armrest, individually recline up to 16 degrees in four steps for relaxing passenger comfort. The 40/20/40 second-row seat configuration also has a one-touch walk-in function, making access to the third row easier. Third-row seating is available on SR5 and Limited grades and features a roomy, supportive seating area. The SR5 and Trail grade come standard with comfortable fabric-trimmed seating available in Sand Beige, Graphite or Black. Available SofTex seats offer a soft, rich feel. New for 2014, the SR5 adds a standard eight-way power driver seat. The Limited comes standard with a leather-trimmed interior with new ventilated driver and front passenger seats in Sand Beige, Black and a new Redwood color. Front seats are also heated with eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat with power lumbar support and four-way power-adjustable passenger seat. Both front seats are now standard with memory settings. Powerful 4.0-liter V6 Helps Take 4Runner Anyplace, Anytime The 4Runner 4.0-liter V6 generates 270 horsepower and 278 lb.-ft. of torque. Dual independent Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) optimizes torque across the engine's operating range. Fuel economy ratings rival some crossover SUVs with an EPA-estimated 17 mpg city and 23 mpg highway for 4x2 models, and 17 mpg city and 22 mpg highway for 4x4. Maximum towing capacity is 5,000 pounds and all vehicles feature an integrated tow-hitch receiver and wiring harness as standard equipment. 4Runner Balances Full Off-Road Capability with Smooth Around-town Handling A double-wishbone independent front suspension, combined with a variable-flow rack-and-pinion steering, help give the 4Runner precise control on demanding roads. Coil springs over gas shocks are used at all four wheels for a comfortable ride and controlled handling. The four-link rear suspension maximizes off-road axle articulation, whileproviding a smooth ride for rear-seat passengers on and off pavement. The Limited grade comes standard with an X-REAS suspension system that further improves performance, comfort and control. With X-REAS, 4Runner corners flatter, smoother, and handles choppy pavement more easily. X-REAS automatically adjusts the damping force of shocks when driving over bumpy surfaces or when cornering. The system uses a center control absorber to cross-link shocks on opposite corners of the vehicle, substantially reducing pitch and yaw by offsetting opposing inputs. The 4Runner SR5 and Trail 4x4 models have a two-speed, part-time four-wheel-drive system with neutral position, maximizing fuel efficiency when a 4x4 configuration isn't needed. The 4Runner Limited is equipped with a full-time, four-wheel-drive system with a locking center differential and a three-mode, center console-mounted switch. The A-TRAC traction control system is standard equipment on all 4x4 models. The system can distribute driving force to any one wheel in contact with the ground, making terrain irregularities and slippery patches virtually transparent to the driver. An electronic-locking rear differential is standard on the Trail grade. The Trail grade is designed to maximize off-road performance with superior approach and departure angles, high ground clearance, and an array of functional upgrades for the most demanding active outdoor enthusiast. The Trail grade offers an optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS). KDSS significantly improves terrain-following ability by dynamically disconnecting stabilizer bars to allow for more axle travel, and better suspension articulation in slow, difficult terrain. Toyota's Crawl Control (CRAWL) feature is standard on the Trail grade. The system helps maintain an appropriate speed to keep the vehicle under control and minimizes the load on drivetrain and suspension components. With the transfer case shifted into low range, CRAWL regulates engine speed and output (along with braking force), to propel the vehicle forward or in reverse at one of the five driver-selectable low-speed settings. This allows the driver to maintain focus on steering over rough level ground or steep grades without having to also modulate the throttle or brake pedal. The Trail grade also features a Multi-Terrain Select system that dials in wheel-slip control to match the terrain. In loose terrain such as mud and sand, more-than-normal wheel slip is permitted, allowing wheel-spin to work in the vehicle's favor. On bumpy moguls, or solid rock, wheel slip is minimized and the system acts more like a limited slip differential. The Mogul setting is for any extremely uneven terrain, such as V-ditches, slopes, and ridges, uphill or down. All models come standard with Hill-start Assist Control (HAC), which provides additional control for off-road driving by helping to hold the vehicle stationary before starting on a steep incline or slippery surface. All 4Runner 4x4 models feature standard Downhill Assist Control (DAC). This feature augments the low-speed ascending ability of low-range by helping to hold the vehicle, allowing time for the driver to a target speed with no driver intervention. Versatility and Convenience Provide Comfort and Utility An array of convenience features and versatile seating configurations provide the 2014 4Runner with ample passenger comfort and utility. Fold-flat second-row seats provide a level load floor in the 4Runner, and it is not necessary to remove the headrests to fold the seats flat. The available third-row seat is split 50/50 and folds flat. The seats can be folded from the side or at the rear, using separate one-touch levers. With this arrangement, more cargo space is available without removing seats, and longer items can be conveniently carried. A Smart Key system featuring keyless entry with push-button start is standard on the Limited grade. The system allows the driver to unlock or start the vehicle by carrying the keyless remote. The cargo door window has jam control, like the moonroof and power side windows. An available pull-out cargo deck is capable of carrying up to 440 pounds to make loading and unloading heavy items easier and to provide seating for tailgating and campsite relaxation. All 4Runner models come standard with a 120V outlet and two additional 12V outlets. A front and rear clearance sonar system is standard on Limited models, and a rear-view backup camera is now standard on all 4Runner models. The system displays in the audio screen, increasing visibility at the rear of the vehicle. New Audio Systems Include Standard Entune Multimedia System New for 2014 on SR5 and Trail grade 4Runner models is Entune Audio Plus, which includes Toyota's Entune multimedia system, an AM/FM/MP3 CD player with eight speakers, integrated SiriusXM Satellite Radio (includes 90-day trial subscription), USB port with iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth® hands-free phone capability and music streaming. Standard on the Limited grade is the new Entune Premium JBL Audio system, which incorporates today's most in-demand connectivity features. It includes the Entune multimedia system, a JBL® premium sound system with navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio (with a 90-day trial subscription), HD Radio with iTunes® tagging and 15 speakers. The navigation system includes a large seven-inch monitor. Entune is a collection of popular mobile applications and data services, with three years of complimentary access. Once a smart phone is connected to the vehicle using Bluetooth wireless technology or a USB cable, Entune's features are operated using the vehicle's controls or, for some services, by voice recognition. Entune offers mobile apps for Bing, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable®, and Pandora®. Entune data services include a fuel price guide, sports scores, stocks, traffic and weather. Standard on all audio systems is a unique ""party mode"" audio setting that is ideal for tailgating, raises bass response and shifts sound balance to the rear of the vehicle. Party mode is in addition bolstered by rear liftgate-mounted speakers, which function with or without party mode selected. The pole antenna has been dropped in favor of a new in-glass antenna. Toyota's Exclusive Star Safety System, Eight Standard Airbags, Safety Connect The 4Runner features Toyota's standard Star Safety System that includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC), an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), and Smart Stop Technology (SST) brake-override system. VSC helps the driver to ensure control by compensating for front and rear wheel slip. The system uses selective braking and modulated engine output to help keep the vehicle in line with the driver's steering inputs. On 4x2 vehicles, the Auto LSD (Limited Slip Differential) system allows for better traction on slippery sections of roadway. The four-wheel ABS with EBD provides the 4Runner with optimal brake proportioning, regardless of vehicle load. Eight standard airbags includes front, side-mounted and knee airbags for the driver and front passenger, and side-curtain airbags for the second and third rows. All 2014 4Runners have active headrests for driver and passenger, and three-point seat belts for all seats. The 2014 4Runner Limited offers the Safety Connect telematics system. Available by subscription, with or without the optional navigation system, Safety Connect offers four safety and security features: Automatic Collision Notification, Stolen Vehicle Location, Emergency Assistance Button (SOS), and Roadside Assistance. When Safety Connect is ordered, it includes a one-year trial subscription. In case of either airbag deployment or severe rear-end collision, an Automatic Collision Notification system is designed to automatically call a dedicated response center. If a response agent cannot communicate with the occupants, the agent can contact the nearest emergency-services provider to dispatch assistance. Pushing the in-vehicle ""SOS"" button allows drivers to reach the response center to request help in an emergency as well as for a wide range of roadside assistance needs. If a 4Runner equipped with Safety Connect is stolen, agents can work with local authorities to help locate and recover the vehicle. 4Runner Includes Toyota Care Complimentary Maintenance Toyota's 36-month/36,000 mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover powertrain for 60,000 miles and corrosion with no mileage limitation. The 4Runner will also come standard with Toyota Careä, a complimentary plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance and 24-hour roadside assistance for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first.

I hate those clear taillights, looks very cheap. 34 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink Okay folks, now I know that this 4runner is freeking out there with its looks, but ya gotta give it to Toyota for one thing...their CEO put out that mandate last year to stop putting out sedate and boring vehicles, and that dude is definately keeping his word...look at the new Avalon and the FR-S...he is definitely putting out product, like it or not, that everyone is talking about in some form or fashion... 43 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink The 4Runner has simply been an unattractive car for sometime now. I appreciate that they are sticking with a true BOF SUV when others (Ford, Nissan) have abandoned the concept. Industry trends are stacked against this car. Toyota probably doesn't mind because it has the Highlander and RAV4 on the CUV side. But I can't help but think that the 4Runner would sell in better numbers if it wasn't so ugly. And a 4Runner from 20 years ago still looks so good. 1 hour ago Report abuse Permalink Spartan is what this vehicle is, but does it also have to be ugly? wtf were they thinking. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink With a little bit of work, this could look 100% better. It's clear it's just a quick refresh of the old model, so they went cheap. Probably a good strategy considering it's not a high volume vehicle. The mixture of curving sheet metal A pillar/windscreen, along with the B pillar front into the roof and the sharp pillars at the C pillar don't mesh. They should all be sharp. Secondly, go with conservative tail-lights. Off-roaders break tail-lights and don't want to be paying a metric ton to replace them. Obviously, the entire front end needs a re-design, and lose the hood scoop. The approach angle in glorious on this beast. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Toyota is at it Again with their Conservative and very Non Competiive design staff. THis is an EPIC fail on 4Runner redesign. To not do anything with the powertrain is a total Joke. Still going with a 5 Speed ... No Way!!! I guess they think so many uninformed auto buyers will just line up to buy a 4Runner. Really ... I think they are going to pay the price at Sales Loses into the 2014 model year against just about everyone else. THis is sort fo the same story with their Tundra and Tacoma ... No real improvements for powertrains and they think their sales will not be effected? THey are smoking some kind of weed over in the TOYOTA Headquarters. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to Paul's comment uh what? Conservative? I think not homie.

I think it was the RSC. It was a two door and more curvaceous but a lot of styling cues seemed to be transplanted here.

"Motorsports: Schumacher to drive Mercedes F1 car on Nürburgring Nordschleife Filed under: Motorsports , Mercedes-Benz In advance of this year's 24 Hours of Nürburgring race, and as a ""thank you"" to German motorsports fans, Mercedes-Benz has arranged quite the driving demonstration at the legendary German track. Seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher will pilot a the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 W02 - the team's 2011 F1 car that carried the Silver Arrow name - around the Nordschleife. As far as we know, this will be the first time that an F1 car will have lapped the North Loop since Nick Heidfeld drove a BMW Sauber car around it in 2007. This will be far from Schumacher's first go with the Nürburgring : In 2011 he drove a classic Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196 (pictured above) for a demo lap around the Grand Prix track, and in 2007 he infamously punted a Ferrari prototype on the Nordschleife . There's no word from Mercedes as to how exactly Schumacher will drive for his 'Ring run this time. Heidfeld's lap was slowed massively by his car wearing hard, demonstration tires and for slow-downs to film the event. We have every expectation that Schumi will be subject to the same demands of safety and public relations. Of course, having the all-time fastest lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife in your CV is something that we'd guess might tempt the über-competitive driver, and he'll certainly have the car to make that happen. Stefan Bellof holds the record for the fastest-ever lap of the 'Ring in its current configuration and length, with a time of 6:25.91 in 1983, at the wheel of a Porsche 956. (Niki Luada has the record at the original length, with a lap of 6:58.6 in 1975, in a Ferrari 312T.) Pundits analyzed the fast bits of Heidfeld's 2007 run, and figured his full-pace time, on admittedly unsticky tires, would have clocked in at around 6:12. Again, we're not suggesting that Schumacher will have the green light to drive at full speed, but it does sound as though the now one-year retired driver is amped for the opportunity. Said Schumacher, ""Posting a lap in a modern Silver Arrow on the most beautiful and most testing circuit in the world, what a brilliant mix - it's every motor racing driver's dream!"" We'll keep our fingers crossed on May 19, and hope that the lap is a hot one.

Schumacher will post a demonstration lap on the Nürburgring's legendary Nordschleife in a MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS F1 W02 to say 'thank you' to his fans for their years of loyal support during his F1 career. This will be the first time since Juan Manuel Fangio's victory on 1st August 1954 that a modern Formula 1 Silver Arrow has driven on the Nordschleife at the Nürburgring. Schumacher covered part of the Nordschleife in the last Formula 1 grand prix at the Nürburgring in July 2011, however, that was in a Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196. The W196 was the first Formula 1 Silver Arrow that took Mercedes-Benz to two world titles with Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1954 and 1955 seasons. During this period, including his success at the Nürburgring, Fangio achieved eight wins in all. Long before the start of the Formula 1 world championship in 1950, however, there has been a close connection between Mercedes-Benz and the Nürburgring; an icon was born on 3rd June 1934 when the Silver Arrow had its first outing on the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife in the International Eifel Race. The car was silver because mechanics had worked through the night to strip away the white paint of the brand new Mercedes-Benz W25 racing car, so as not to exceed the maximum permissible weight. The next day, Manfred von Brauchitsch won the W25's debut race, beginning the legend of the Silver Arrow. Michael Schumacher brought his F1 career to a close last year at MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS. In April this year, Schumacher and Mercedes-Benz announced a long-term partnership that goes far beyond motor racing and Formula 1. The record-breaking champion will represent the brand as an ambassador and provide back-up for issues relating to future developments. Intelligence Drive  the safety and convenience system introduced by Mercedes-Benz  is part of his brief. Michael Schumacher: ""I have a lot of fond memories of the Nürburgring and am really looking forward to giving fans and friends from my home town of Kerpen, which is quite close to the Nürburgring, something to remember as they see me drive by. But it will be a fantastic experience for me too, driving along the Nordschleife in a state-ofthe-art Formula 1 Silver Arrow, particularly in view of the fact that the Silver Arrow's legend began here.

Scroll down for a press release highlighting the automaker's future fuel-saving initiatives. VOLKSWAGEN PRESENTS FUTURE DRIVE SYSTEMS AT VIENNA SYMPOSIUM -Group Chairman announces 10-speed DSG and high-performance diesel engine -Plug-in hybrid most promising alternative drive system -Natural gas vehicles offer great potential for sustained mobility Vienna/Wolfsburg, 26 April 2013: Today at the 34th International Vienna Motor Symposium Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, gave a forecast of future drive system technologies. Areas of work being focussed on by Volkswagen include the development of a high-performance diesel engine delivering 100kW per litre of displacement and a new 10-speed dual clutch gearbox that reduces fuel consumption. Among the alternative drive systems plug-in hybrids in particular offer great potential. Winterkorn stressed that over the medium and long-term different drive system technologies would exist side by side. These would range from highly efficient internal combustion engines and natural gas systems all the way to hybrids and electric vehicles. On this basis the Volkswagen Group was working towards its declared objective of lowering the European new car fleet's CO2 emission level to 95g of CO2/km by 2020. Winterkorn emphasised that existing internal combustion engines still offer a lot of potential: 'Since the year 2000, we've reduced the fuel consumption of our TDI and TSI engines by more than 30 per cent. I'm convinced that by 2020 we can achieve further increases in efficiency of around 15 per cent.' Factors making this possible, he said, would include enhancement of the combustion process, intelligent lightweight design, innovative operating strategies and optimisation of friction levels and thermal management. Volkswagen also sees great potential for natural gas drive systems: 'The gas engine is environmentally friendly, economical and suitable for everyday use. The technology is fully developed and the vehicles are already on the market.' The best example is the new eco-up! - at 79g of CO2/km the world's most economical natural gas car. The Volkswagen Group will be systematically rolling out natural gas technology with the Golf TGI BlueMotion and the Audi A3 g-tron. Winterkorn: 'We need to make the public even more aware of the benefits of natural gas engines. Everyone needs to play their part in this: carmakers, politicians and the fuel industry.' The variety of drive system technologies is growing: the group-wide Volkswagen modular component system and its flexible architecture enable every kind of drive system to be integrated quickly into the new models. 'Over the coming years we will electrify all vehicle classes in this way and help electrically powered motoring to make the breakthrough,' added Winterkorn. In the medium term the first choice in terms of alternative drive systems is plug-in hybrid technology. This enables a purely electric range of up to 50 kilometres, a high level of suitability for everyday use by virtue of recharging from a socket at home and also complete flexibility for long journeys thanks to an efficient internal combustion engine. The Volkswagen Group's first plug-in hybrids, the Porsche Panamera and Audi A3 e-tron, will shortly be going into full production. They will be followed by the Golf and many other models, such as the Passat, Audi A6 and Porsche Cayenne. Volkswagen also presented at the symposium new technologies that are finding their way into the modular diesel component system's future engine generation. These high-performance diesel engines achieve peak power output of 100kW per litre of displacement and have a variable valve-train assembly, a high-pressure injection system at up to 3,000 bar and combined charging with the innovative e-booster.

Yesterday at 9:19 PM Report abuse Permalink It will be revolutionary if they actually get 134 hp/liter out of a production diesel. My interest is piqued. Yesterday at 7:44 PM Report abuse Permalink This is very interesting. The company that is striving to become #1 (and it already IS number one in some parameters) decided to put R&D money into more than 7-speed dual clutch transmission AND in 140 hp/liter diesel ... what does that tell you? To me, it tells me that proper car will not be built before they get a nice huge return from that investment - which is probably 15-20 years away from today. The proper car having NO transmission and using NO fuel to power 4 electric motors - one on each wheel. Wall St , you better take note. Elon, sorry for your luck.

I have a co-worker who brags about his Ford Freestyle (with ZF CVT) that now has almost 275,000 miles without any engine and transmission problems. Yesterday at 4:03 PM Report abuse Permalink Yes, and they announced a 3,500 NM car some time ago, which turned out to be a lie. They lied about their emissions, their sales, and covered a massive crash-test failure of the A4 in 2012. So allow me to be skeptical about what this main says. Yesterday at 3:26 PM Report abuse Permalink The 10 speed could be good for their ""offroad"" vehicles. Set the 3rd or 4th gear as ""1st"" for road driving and the lower ones could be used for as a sort of pseudo transfer case. High torque, low speed. Doubt it'll happen, i'm just thinking strange **** up. Yesterday at 11:22 AM Report abuse Permalink Yeah...that's work as well as my first Schwinn (geezer alert!) 10-speed. It had maybe three-four useful gears...the others were duplicates or so close that it didn't matter. Same with 27 speed bikes today....squirrely duplicative gears. A little work with a calculator and custom clusters can drop back to a thicker, more durable chain and 4-5 gears on the back and two at most up front...oops, back to 8-10 speeds. But make them wide-ratio. 10 speeds in a car just seems like a CVT with discernible shift points. And don't get me started on ZF transmission reliability and power handling capability or lack thereof. Yesterday at 9:47 AM Report abuse Permalink I think the car companies are engaged in transmission wars. Watch for a company like ZF to go ahead and introduce an 11 or 12 speed transmission, just because people will want to have it in their car to boast about. You have room to grow more gears in a RWD car, but you'd think they would run out of room for the FWD and AWD versions. Yesterday at 9:35 AM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to strykerzzzz's comment Exactly. We had megapixel wars in cameras to the point when adding pixels (without increasing sensor physical size) lowered the photo quality. Phone screen sizes are making it impossible to operate them with one hand...

"Official: Chrysler investing $20M in Toledo plant to support 9-speed auto production Filed under: Plants/Manufacturing , Chrysler , Dodge , Jeep In 2011, Chrysler announced a $72-million investment in its Toledo Machining Plant to modernize production of the eight- and nine-speed torque-converters for automatic transmissions made there. That upgrade work won't be finished until Q3 of this year, but Chrysler has already announced a further $19.6-million investment to increase production capacity for the nine-speeders. The extra units will be necessary because the nine-speed transmission they'll be mated to is going into three popular models: it will debut on the 2014 Jeep Cherokee , then go into the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart . The company predicted that this year alone it would sell 200,000 units equipped with the nine-speed tranny, and it is spending some $374 million in addition to the investment in Toledo to upgrade production capacity for it. The work attached to this new investment won't begin until Q3 of 2014, and it will be finished by the end of that year. There's a press release below with all the details.

Related Gallery 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk: New York 2013 Chrysler Group Plans to Invest Nearly $20 Million in Toledo Machining Plant - Investment to increase capacity for production of torque converters for new generation, fuel-efficient nine-speed transmission - Company's total investment in U.S. facilities over $5.2 billion since June 2009 April 26, 2013 , Auburn Hills, Mich. - Chrysler Group LLC announced today that it will invest $19.6 million in its Toledo Machining Plant in Perrysburg, Ohio, to increase capacity of the torque converter it's machining for the nine-speed transmission. With this announcement, the Company's total investments in its U.S. operations since June 2009 increase to over $5.2 billion. The new torque converters will be paired with the next generation, fuel efficient nine-speed front-wheel drive transmission being assembled at Chrysler Group's Indiana (Kokomo, Ind.) Transmission Plant I. The new transmission will debut in the 2014 Jeep® Cherokee. ""The new nine-speed transmission is a critical part of our strategy to meet fuel economy requirements over the next several years and Toledo Machining will play an integral role in bringing this transmission to market,"" said Scott Garberding, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing, Chrysler Group LLC. ""Securing this additional investment is a testament to the dedication and commitment of the plant's workforce and helps secure its future long-term."" The investment will fund the installation of new equipment and tooling for additional machining and assembly capacity. Installation is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2014 and will be completed by the end of 2014. In August 2011, a $72 million investment in Toledo Machining was announced to modernize the plant to produce the eight- and nine-speed torque converters on two new production lines and a new steering column for the Dodge Dart and Jeep Cherokee. These installations will be complete in the third quarter this year. ""We're very pleased that Chrysler is once again investing in the Toledo Machining Plant and the skilled workforce there,"" said General Holiefield, Vice President and Director, UAW Chrysler Department. ""This will help preserve and enhance jobs in the area and give a greater measure of security to our members and their families well into the future."" In February, the Company announced that it was investing $374 million in several of its Kokomo, Ind., facilities, including establishing a new manufacturing site in Tipton, Ind., to increase production capacity of the nine-speed transmission. Toledo Machining currently produces torque converters for Kokomo Transmission (Ind.), Indiana Transmission I and II (Kokomo, Ind.), Sterling Heights Assembly (Mich.), and Toluca (Mex.). The plant also produces steering columns for the following assembly plants: Warren Truck (Mich.), Belvidere (Ill.), Sterling Heights (Mich.), Toledo Assembly Complex (Ohio); Windsor (Ont.), Toluca (Mex.), Saltillo (Mex.), Arab American Vehicles (Egypt) and Carabobo (Venezuela).

"Report: Boston bombers were tracked using Mercedes mbrace [w/video] Filed under: Performance , Government/Legal , Technology , Mercedes-Benz , Luxury We now know Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the two brothers said to be behind the Boston Marathon bombings, planned to head for New York City to detonate more improvised explosive devices. As it turns out, that plan was foiled by the quick thinking of one Mercedes-Benz owner, diligent police work and the Mercedes-Benz mbrace system. When the brothers carjacked a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as ""Danny,"" they didn't realize his Mercedes-Benz M-Class was equipped with the mbrace system, which can call for help in the event of an accident or track the vehicle in the event of a theft. According to reports, the Tsarnaev brothers held Danny hostage for nearly 90 minutes while they drove around Boston forming a plan until they had to stop for fuel. When one of the brothers went inside to pay, the other put his gun down for a moment. Danny took the opportunity to unlatch his seat belt, open the door and run to another nearby gas station, where he told the owner to call the police. When police arrived, they used the mbrace system to track the SUV after receiving Danny's permission, and it wasn't long before a shootout between police and the brothers ensued. When it was over, the eldest brother lay dead in the street. For more on the story, view the video report available below .

As it turns out, that plan was foiled by the quick thinking of one Mercedes-Benz owner, diligent police work and the Mercedes-Benz mbrace system. When the brothers carjacked a 26-year-old Chinese entrepreneur identified only as ""Danny,"" they didn't realize his Mercedes-Benz M-Class was equipped with the mbrace system, which can call for help in the event of an accident or track the vehicle in the event of a theft. According to reports, the Tsarnaev brothers held Danny hostage for nearly 90 minutes while they drove around Boston forming a plan until they had to stop for fuel. When one of the brothers went inside to pay, the other put his gun down for a moment. Danny took the opportunity to unlatch his seat belt, open the door and run to another nearby gas station, where he told the owner to call the police. When police arrived, they used the mbrace system to track the SUV after receiving Danny's permission, and it wasn't long before a shootout between police and the brothers ensued. When it was over, the eldest brother lay dead in the street. For more on the story, view the video report available below .

Until we stop all immigration from Muslim countries, events like this will continue to happen daily. Of course, the communists (liberals) like Obama fully support these scumbags. These people, combined with the 47% urban leeches, are the Democratic voting base. The growing threat of Islam is coming from within, and if we don't put a stop to it, soon we will find ourselves under a communist Marxist Islamic Jihadist rule (which is Obama's plan) soon. The Democrats have always been the party which supports extremist Islam. The fact that they ended the Iraq war (hich we began against an extremist Muslim dictator who supported the 9/11 terrorists who planned to use WMDs on America) proves that they support this communist Islamic agenda. They also HATE Israel, and want to wipe it and it's people off the map, andreplace it with ""Palestine"". They have the audacity to support a MOSQUE at ground 0, and now they are whining about the ""Miranda rights"" of this terrorist. Until we vote for a REAL conservative like Bachmann, Santorum, Rubio, or West, America will continue to die and be replaced by a communist Muslim stye. I know that this comment will be deleted by liberal HuffPost/ AB, but tell me liberals, since you hate America, why don't you go live in country which supports your values better?

The new car's revelation at the 2013 Monaco F1 Grand Prix will be followed by a series of other dynamic demonstrations at events such as July's Festival of Speed at Goodwood, England.

"Official: 2014 Toyota 4Runner revealed at Stagecoach Music Festival [UPDATE: w/video] Filed under: SUV , Videos , Toyota , Design/Style Toyota has just pulled the sheet off its updated 2014 4Runner at the 2013 Stagecoach Music Festival near Palm Springs, California. Toyota is the title sponsor at the festival, and claims that this is the first-ever global reveal of a new automobile at a major music festival. We're also guessing this is the first time that the 4Runner has seen duty inside what looks like a vintage circus act's cage . We can see from the photos that the body-on-frame SUV has received a freshened look with new smoked light fixtures front and rear, along with a boldly reworked front fascia and grille. The profile view seems largely unchanged, though there are new wheel patterns on offer. The 4Runner will continue to be offered in three trims, including SR5, more luxurious Limited, and off-road-ready Trail specification. Both 4x2 and both part- and full-time 4x4 models will continue to be available, all will be powered by the same 4.0-liter 270-horsepower V6 and five-speed automatic as last year. Other changes for the 2014 model year include a retouched interior featuring new Optitron gauges, a multi-information display, and changes in trim. On the entertainment front, there are new head units with Toyota's Entune infotainment technology and an in-glass antenna replacing the previous mast unit. The optional navigation unit features a seven-inch screen. Check out our gallery above and the official press release below for the full scoop. : A video has been added below to go with the press release.

Toyota is the title sponsor at the festival, and claims that this is the first-ever global reveal of a new automobile at a major music festival. We're also guessing this is the first time that the 4Runner has seen duty inside what looks like a vintage circus act's cage . We can see from the photos that the body-on-frame SUV has received a freshened look with new smoked light fixtures front and rear, along with a boldly reworked front fascia and grille. The profile view seems largely unchanged, though there are new wheel patterns on offer. The 4Runner will continue to be offered in three trims, including SR5, more luxurious Limited, and off-road-ready Trail specification. Both 4x2 and both part- and full-time 4x4 models will continue to be available, all will be powered by the same 4.0-liter 270-horsepower V6 and five-speed automatic as last year. Other changes for the 2014 model year include a retouched interior featuring new Optitron gauges, a multi-information display, and changes in trim. On the entertainment front, there are new head units with Toyota's Entune infotainment technology and an in-glass antenna replacing the previous mast unit. The optional navigation unit features a seven-inch screen. Check out our gallery above and the official press release below for the full scoop. : A video has been added below to go with the press release. Enjoy!

Currently in its fifth-generation, 4Runner continues as one of the few fully capable mid-size SUVs, and the redesigned 2014 4Runner receives a rugged new exterior design, and interior refinements that add comfort and convenience without sacrificing its hallmark performance capability and excellent value. The 4Runner combines rugged body-on-frame construction with comprehensive suspension technology that yields optimal off-road capability with a smooth ride and comfort more often associated with crossovers. The 2014 4Runner is available in three grades: a well-equipped, value-driven SR5; top-of-the-line Limited, and a Trail grade for those who want maximum off-road capability. Optional third-row seats on SR5 and Limited allow for up to seven-person capacity. 4Runner owners will have the choice of a rear wheel 4x2, part-time 4x4 or a full-time multi-mode 4x4 with a locking center differential. All models are equipped with a powerful 4.0-liter, 270-horsepower V6 teamed to a five-speed ECT-i automatic transmission and one of the few vehicles that continues to offer a transfer case. 4Runner's Rugged Exterior Design Projects Its Off-Road Heritage With a Premium Refinement The refreshed 4Runner features a redesigned front fascia that conveys a more rugged and aggressive appearance. This includes a muscular front grille, and edgier smoked headlamps for a more forceful look. The SR5 and Trail grades feature a color-keyed grille insert and front bumper that is surrounded by fog lamps set in sharply cut inlays that extend from the headlamps down to the bumper. The Trail grade features new color-keyed bumpers and overfenders, and it continues to be distinguished by an aggressive hood scoop and silver painted front and rear bumper accents. All grades are now standard with a roof rack. In addition to the distinctive new grille, the premium Limited's front design stands apart with a chrome-plated grille insert and chrome front bumper that extends to the fog-lamp bezels. The side molding, roof rack and rear bumper are also chrome trimmed. The headlamps have also changed from halogen to projector beam, with both the headlamps and redesigned rear combination lamps on all 4Runner grades now featuring LED lamps. Both the SR5 and Trail grades will ride on 17-inch alloy wheels with a new wheel-design for both, while the Limited continues to ride on 20-inch alloy wheels, which are now painted black prior to machining to add contrast. All grades continue to come standard with a full-size spare. The 2014 4Runner will be available in eight exterior colors that include new additions: Super White; Attitude Black Metallic; Barcelona Red Metallic; and Nautical Blue Metallic. They will join carryover colors that include: Blizzard Pearl; Classic Silver Metallic; Magnetic Gray Metallic; and Black. New Interior Styling Has a refined style with the Comfort expected of a Mid-size SUV The 4Runner exterior updates are complemented by touches of refinement on the inside. Both the SR5 and Trail grade add standard Soft Touch door trim, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and leather shift knob provide a premium feel and atmosphere. The SR5 receives a new bright and highly visible Optitron instrument panel that houses speedometer, tachometer, voltage, fuel and coolant temperature gauges, plus a multi-information display that offers multiple functions. An Eco-Driving feedback system allows the driver to monitor fuel consumption in real time. On 4Runner Trail, an overhead console within easy reach organizes the off-road control switches into one location. A compass indicator and outside temperature display add functionality. A manually controlled air conditioning system is standard on SR5 and Trail grades; the Limited features an automatic dual-zone climate-control system. For second-row passengers, a sculpted front seat-back shape provides additional knee space. The second-row seats, which include a center armrest, individually recline up to 16 degrees in four steps for relaxing passenger comfort. The 40/20/40 second-row seat configuration also has a one-touch walk-in function, making access to the third row easier. Third-row seating is available on SR5 and Limited grades and features a roomy, supportive seating area. The SR5 and Trail grade come standard with comfortable fabric-trimmed seating available in Sand Beige, Graphite or Black. Available SofTex seats offer a soft, rich feel. New for 2014, the SR5 adds a standard eight-way power driver seat. The Limited comes standard with a leather-trimmed interior with new ventilated driver and front passenger seats in Sand Beige, Black and a new Redwood color. Front seats are also heated with eight-way power-adjustable driver's seat with power lumbar support and four-way power-adjustable passenger seat. Both front seats are now standard with memory settings. Powerful 4.0-liter V6 Helps Take 4Runner Anyplace, Anytime The 4Runner 4.0-liter V6 generates 270 horsepower and 278 lb.-ft. of torque. Dual independent Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i) optimizes torque across the engine's operating range. Fuel economy ratings rival some crossover SUVs with an EPA-estimated 17 mpg city and 23 mpg highway for 4x2 models, and 17 mpg city and 22 mpg highway for 4x4. Maximum towing capacity is 5,000 pounds and all vehicles feature an integrated tow-hitch receiver and wiring harness as standard equipment. 4Runner Balances Full Off-Road Capability with Smooth Around-town Handling A double-wishbone independent front suspension, combined with a variable-flow rack-and-pinion steering, help give the 4Runner precise control on demanding roads. Coil springs over gas shocks are used at all four wheels for a comfortable ride and controlled handling. The four-link rear suspension maximizes off-road axle articulation, whileproviding a smooth ride for rear-seat passengers on and off pavement. The Limited grade comes standard with an X-REAS suspension system that further improves performance, comfort and control. With X-REAS, 4Runner corners flatter, smoother, and handles choppy pavement more easily. X-REAS automatically adjusts the damping force of shocks when driving over bumpy surfaces or when cornering. The system uses a center control absorber to cross-link shocks on opposite corners of the vehicle, substantially reducing pitch and yaw by offsetting opposing inputs. The 4Runner SR5 and Trail 4x4 models have a two-speed, part-time four-wheel-drive system with neutral position, maximizing fuel efficiency when a 4x4 configuration isn't needed. The 4Runner Limited is equipped with a full-time, four-wheel-drive system with a locking center differential and a three-mode, center console-mounted switch. The A-TRAC traction control system is standard equipment on all 4x4 models. The system can distribute driving force to any one wheel in contact with the ground, making terrain irregularities and slippery patches virtually transparent to the driver. An electronic-locking rear differential is standard on the Trail grade. The Trail grade is designed to maximize off-road performance with superior approach and departure angles, high ground clearance, and an array of functional upgrades for the most demanding active outdoor enthusiast. The Trail grade offers an optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS). KDSS significantly improves terrain-following ability by dynamically disconnecting stabilizer bars to allow for more axle travel, and better suspension articulation in slow, difficult terrain. Toyota's Crawl Control (CRAWL) feature is standard on the Trail grade. The system helps maintain an appropriate speed to keep the vehicle under control and minimizes the load on drivetrain and suspension components. With the transfer case shifted into low range, CRAWL regulates engine speed and output (along with braking force), to propel the vehicle forward or in reverse at one of the five driver-selectable low-speed settings. This allows the driver to maintain focus on steering over rough level ground or steep grades without having to also modulate the throttle or brake pedal. The Trail grade also features a Multi-Terrain Select system that dials in wheel-slip control to match the terrain. In loose terrain such as mud and sand, more-than-normal wheel slip is permitted, allowing wheel-spin to work in the vehicle's favor. On bumpy moguls, or solid rock, wheel slip is minimized and the system acts more like a limited slip differential. The Mogul setting is for any extremely uneven terrain, such as V-ditches, slopes, and ridges, uphill or down. All models come standard with Hill-start Assist Control (HAC), which provides additional control for off-road driving by helping to hold the vehicle stationary before starting on a steep incline or slippery surface. All 4Runner 4x4 models feature standard Downhill Assist Control (DAC). This feature augments the low-speed ascending ability of low-range by helping to hold the vehicle, allowing time for the driver to a target speed with no driver intervention. Versatility and Convenience Provide Comfort and Utility An array of convenience features and versatile seating configurations provide the 2014 4Runner with ample passenger comfort and utility. Fold-flat second-row seats provide a level load floor in the 4Runner, and it is not necessary to remove the headrests to fold the seats flat. The available third-row seat is split 50/50 and folds flat. The seats can be folded from the side or at the rear, using separate one-touch levers. With this arrangement, more cargo space is available without removing seats, and longer items can be conveniently carried. A Smart Key system featuring keyless entry with push-button start is standard on the Limited grade. The system allows the driver to unlock or start the vehicle by carrying the keyless remote. The cargo door window has jam control, like the moonroof and power side windows. An available pull-out cargo deck is capable of carrying up to 440 pounds to make loading and unloading heavy items easier and to provide seating for tailgating and campsite relaxation. All 4Runner models come standard with a 120V outlet and two additional 12V outlets. A front and rear clearance sonar system is standard on Limited models, and a rear-view backup camera is now standard on all 4Runner models. The system displays in the audio screen, increasing visibility at the rear of the vehicle. New Audio Systems Include Standard Entune Multimedia System New for 2014 on SR5 and Trail grade 4Runner models is Entune Audio Plus, which includes Toyota's Entune multimedia system, an AM/FM/MP3 CD player with eight speakers, integrated SiriusXM Satellite Radio (includes 90-day trial subscription), USB port with iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth® hands-free phone capability and music streaming. Standard on the Limited grade is the new Entune Premium JBL Audio system, which incorporates today's most in-demand connectivity features. It includes the Entune multimedia system, a JBL® premium sound system with navigation, SiriusXM Satellite Radio (with a 90-day trial subscription), HD Radio with iTunes® tagging and 15 speakers. The navigation system includes a large seven-inch monitor. Entune is a collection of popular mobile applications and data services, with three years of complimentary access. Once a smart phone is connected to the vehicle using Bluetooth wireless technology or a USB cable, Entune's features are operated using the vehicle's controls or, for some services, by voice recognition. Entune offers mobile apps for Bing, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable®, and Pandora®. Entune data services include a fuel price guide, sports scores, stocks, traffic and weather. Standard on all audio systems is a unique ""party mode"" audio setting that is ideal for tailgating, raises bass response and shifts sound balance to the rear of the vehicle. Party mode is in addition bolstered by rear liftgate-mounted speakers, which function with or without party mode selected. The pole antenna has been dropped in favor of a new in-glass antenna. Toyota's Exclusive Star Safety System, Eight Standard Airbags, Safety Connect The 4Runner features Toyota's standard Star Safety System that includes Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with traction control (TRAC), an Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), and Smart Stop Technology (SST) brake-override system. VSC helps the driver to ensure control by compensating for front and rear wheel slip. The system uses selective braking and modulated engine output to help keep the vehicle in line with the driver's steering inputs. On 4x2 vehicles, the Auto LSD (Limited Slip Differential) system allows for better traction on slippery sections of roadway. The four-wheel ABS with EBD provides the 4Runner with optimal brake proportioning, regardless of vehicle load. Eight standard airbags includes front, side-mounted and knee airbags for the driver and front passenger, and side-curtain airbags for the second and third rows. All 2014 4Runners have active headrests for driver and passenger, and three-point seat belts for all seats. The 2014 4Runner Limited offers the Safety Connect telematics system. Available by subscription, with or without the optional navigation system, Safety Connect offers four safety and security features: Automatic Collision Notification, Stolen Vehicle Location, Emergency Assistance Button (SOS), and Roadside Assistance. When Safety Connect is ordered, it includes a one-year trial subscription. In case of either airbag deployment or severe rear-end collision, an Automatic Collision Notification system is designed to automatically call a dedicated response center. If a response agent cannot communicate with the occupants, the agent can contact the nearest emergency-services provider to dispatch assistance. Pushing the in-vehicle ""SOS"" button allows drivers to reach the response center to request help in an emergency as well as for a wide range of roadside assistance needs. If a 4Runner equipped with Safety Connect is stolen, agents can work with local authorities to help locate and recover the vehicle. 4Runner Includes Toyota Care Complimentary Maintenance Toyota's 36-month/36,000 mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover powertrain for 60,000 miles and corrosion with no mileage limitation. The 4Runner will also come standard with Toyota Careä, a complimentary plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance and 24-hour roadside assistance for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first.

I hate those clear taillights, looks very cheap. 34 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink Okay folks, now I know that this 4runner is freeking out there with its looks, but ya gotta give it to Toyota for one thing...their CEO put out that mandate last year to stop putting out sedate and boring vehicles, and that dude is definately keeping his word...look at the new Avalon and the FR-S...he is definitely putting out product, like it or not, that everyone is talking about in some form or fashion... 43 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink The 4Runner has simply been an unattractive car for sometime now. I appreciate that they are sticking with a true BOF SUV when others (Ford, Nissan) have abandoned the concept. Industry trends are stacked against this car. Toyota probably doesn't mind because it has the Highlander and RAV4 on the CUV side. But I can't help but think that the 4Runner would sell in better numbers if it wasn't so ugly. And a 4Runner from 20 years ago still looks so good. 1 hour ago Report abuse Permalink Spartan is what this vehicle is, but does it also have to be ugly? wtf were they thinking. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink With a little bit of work, this could look 100% better. It's clear it's just a quick refresh of the old model, so they went cheap. Probably a good strategy considering it's not a high volume vehicle. The mixture of curving sheet metal A pillar/windscreen, along with the B pillar front into the roof and the sharp pillars at the C pillar don't mesh. They should all be sharp. Secondly, go with conservative tail-lights. Off-roaders break tail-lights and don't want to be paying a metric ton to replace them. Obviously, the entire front end needs a re-design, and lose the hood scoop. The approach angle in glorious on this beast. 2 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Toyota is at it Again with their Conservative and very Non Competiive design staff. THis is an EPIC fail on 4Runner redesign. To not do anything with the powertrain is a total Joke. Still going with a 5 Speed ... No Way!!! I guess they think so many uninformed auto buyers will just line up to buy a 4Runner. Really ... I think they are going to pay the price at Sales Loses into the 2014 model year against just about everyone else. THis is sort fo the same story with their Tundra and Tacoma ... No real improvements for powertrains and they think their sales will not be effected? THey are smoking some kind of weed over in the TOYOTA Headquarters. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to Paul's comment uh what? Conservative? I think not homie. Now, if you wanna say its ugly, I could understand that...but this is not what the usual conservative and boring Toyota usually does... 53 minutes ago Report abuse Permalink Typical Toyota styling I care about reliability,safety,performance,capability,versatility and not the looks. This Toyota has everything that I'm looking for.i got a 2008 fj cruiser, 2004 corolla s and 2004 Toyota sienna and I have no problem with these cars. How about u guys how often do u guys have problem with ur car? Don't be hatin' 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to gioaler's comment The only hatin' I am doing regarding Toyota is the the hate for the boredom I feel behind the wheel when I end up with one for a rental. Yaaaawn. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Looks good. Has good lineage. Now give us a Diesel so that hood scoop is good cor something. And please don't give the Lexus version those hideous tall but skinny wheels that is has now. 4 hours ago Report abuse Permalink This reminds me of the concept they had a few years back... I think it was the RSC. It was a two door and more curvaceous but a lot of styling cues seemed to be transplanted here. I have to say that price is still steep for a 4Runner but they are nice trucks and if you want a real body on frame SUV they're a good bet. 5 hours ago Report abuse Permalink Absolutely hideous.

"Official: New Mercedes Unimog debuts to the cheers of little boys everywhere [w/video] Filed under: Truck , Work , Mercedes-Benz , Specialty , Diesel , Off-Road The Mercedes-Benz Unimog , the superhero villain of the off-road world that's just waiting to make the jump to Transformer, has been completely upgraded for its new generation. There are ten models, expanding the range and getting new designations across the traditional all-terrain series and the implement-carrier series. Panoramic cabins get more visibility, multifunction steering wheels and better dash clusters, improved HVAC and a three-mode central tire inflation system. Outside, there are new items like LED headlights and daytime running lamps in the bumper, roof-mounted windshield wipers and a front-camera monitor for the implement carrier. The new engine lineup is compliant with Euro VI, featuring four- and six-cylinder BlueEfficiency engines putting out anywhere from 156 horsepower to 354 hp. Powerplant placement has also been tweaked, the chassis members getting a revised curve to place the engine a bit further back and lower, maintaining off-road clearance and lowering the Unimog's center of gravity. The new location of the engine means the cabin has more room, and the wheelbase is shorter. Combined with a higher turning angle, the Unimog has a smaller turning radius than before. The implement carrier gets what's called a ""synergistic traveling drive,"" the bonus being that drivers don't need to stop in order to use an attachment - a hydrostatic transmission works with the regular manual transmission at up to 31 kilometers per hour for seamless switching. Those are just a tiny number of the changes in the new monsters from Mercedes-Benz . You can find out enough about them in the two videos and three press releases below to become a certified dealer.

Those are just a tiny number of the changes in the new monsters from Mercedes-Benz . You can find out enough about them in the two videos and three press releases below to become a certified dealer. New set-up for Unimog and Econic Strong new image for globally unique concepts - Unimog and Econic: Cleaner, more efficient, more powerful - BlueEfficiency Power engine generation with four-cylinder and six cylinder engines from 115 kW (156 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp) - Powerful and environmentally acceptable: Thoroughly renewed with state-of-the-art drive technology, control concept and cab - Unimog: New unique synergetic traction drive sets new standards in competition - Econic: Up to 4 percent lower fuel consumption - Econic: same payload despite Euro VI World premieres from Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks: A Unimog product range with ten new models at one go  from the Unimog U 216 to the Unimog U 5024  and 2 and 3-axle versions for the Econic low-entry specialists vehicle introduce the era of Euro VI engines also for special vehicles. All this is combined with an appreciable increase in performance, efficiency and easy operation. Despite the challenges arising from the Euro VI emission standards involving additional components and an increased volume of 120 litres, it has been possible to retain and improve the concept advantages of the two vehicle product ranges. As the new Europe-wide Euro VI emission standards will be valid from 1 January 2014, Mercedes-Benz is rounding off its range of commercial vehicles including the Atego, Antos, Arocs and Actros by launching the two special vehicle product ranges Unimog and Econic to comply with the new regulations. The new engines have up to 90 percent fewer exhaust gas and particulate matter emissions than those used up to now. New structures for the Unimog product range In the new set-up for the Unimog implement carriers, the Unimog U 216 and U 218 replace the previous Unimog U 20 as compact entry-level models and are getting closer to the versions with stronger engines now known as U 318, U 423, U 430, U 527 and U 530. Here the first number denotes the size (for instance 4 corresponds to the current Unimog U 400), the following two numbers stand for the first two numbers of horse-power performance, for example 23 for 230 hp. They are all being launched with, amongst other things, a completely redesigned panoramic cab, new work and power hydraulics systems as well as synergetic traction drive which allows changing over from manual transmission to hydrostatic transmission while driving and all of these innovations make an appreciable difference to the efficiency of the Unimog. The extremely mobile off-road Unimog U 4000 und U 5000 have also been given a more advanced design in important details and are now known under the reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023. For the Econic  the 2 and 3-axle chassis versions now as 4x2, 6x4 and 6x2/4 with electronically steered forward and trailing axles  the concept of the low-entry cab has now been given more potential with a great number of important ergonomic innovations. In addition, it is clearly more cost-effective as it has reduced its fuel consumption and repair and maintenance costs. However the payload remains the same despite the Euro VI. Facing the future efficiently with BlueEfficiency Power Two BlueEfficiency Power model series engines with radically new designs ensure that the Unimog complies with Euro VI emission standards and is also much more efficient especially when using implements as here greater output is available. The Econic has also been given two engines from this generation: engine types OM 934 and OM 936 with three 4-cylinder and two 6-cylinder versions and performances ranging from 115 kW (156 hp) to 260 kW (354 hp) with cubic capacities of 5.1 litres and 7.7 litres. The state-of-the-art drive units combine low fuel consumption with extremely clean exhaust gas and ensure that the Unimog is on the road altogether more efficiently despite the great amount of effort invested in its construction to ensure that it complies with Euro VI. For the Econic it has been possible to achieve up to four percent lower fuel consumption. The engines - already successfully used in the Antos and Atego - are very convincing with their improved output and torque and clearly increased acceleration over the whole transmission range. Despite the Euro VI the fuel consumption of the Unimog has also been reduced. High-tech drive units from a state-of-the-art engine generation The new solenoid injectors with ten-hole jets provide the best possible injection for every working situation. These new, long-stroke engines with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and a specific engine output of up to 33.8 kW/l (46 hp/l) are among the most effective diesel units. The new 5.1 litre 4-cylinder version also produces a convincing top torque of 650 Nm for the entry-level model Unimog U 216 with 115 kW (156 hp) which remains constant over the whole of the main transmission range from 1200 to 1600 rpm. The six-cylinder gives a powerful performance The performance spectrum of the big 7.7 litre in-line 6-cylinder OM 936 follows directly on the heels of the extremely compact four-cylinder version. It is used in both the U 427 and U 430 as well as the U 527 and U 530 and here for both versions with 200 kW (272 hp) or 220 kW (299 hp). This means that the Unimog has been given top-level motorisation. The best torque result lies at 1200 Nm for the 1200 to 1600 speed range. The Econic has been fitted with 6â??cylinder engines providing an output of 220 kW (299 hp) and 260 kW (354 hp). Economy of space on compact chassis Great importance was also attached to economy of space when complying with the exhaust gas cleaning standards required by Euro VI which comes into force on 1 January 2014. This was a task which faced the designers with demanding challenges considering the compact chassis of the Unimog vehicles and also the low-entry concept of the Econic. In addition to the recirculation of the exhaust gas inside the engine, cleaning the exhaust gas also involves a system comprising the oxidation catalytic converter, a closed particulate matter filter, AdBlue injection and an SCR catalytic converter connected in a series. - END - New set-up for Unimog and Econic Unimog U 4023 and U 5023: Setting standards for off-road mobility - Perfection off-road, better handling with centrally-positioned engine - New BlueEfficiency Power Euro VI engines with higher output and higher torque - Chassis concept with torsionally flexible frame, torque tubes and coil springs retained - Strong and reliable, many details improved - New engine power take-off with increased applications The outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog with its new reference numbers U 4023 and U 5023 as the follow-up models for the U 4000 and U 5000 is now more environmentally acceptable and efficient, but still just as mobile off the road as its predecessors and even stronger  that means better all round. It is fitted with the new four-cylinder BlueEfficiency Power BlueTec 6 engine with an output of 170 kW (230 hp) and a strong torque of 900 Nm. The Unimog transmission has been improved and uprated so that the gear changing times are shorter with an increased life span. In future the gears will be changed using the pitman arm on the steering column and this also includes the electronic quick reverse function (EQR). As up to now, there are eight forward and six reverse gears available as well as the optional crawler gears for off-road use with a speed range between 2.5-35 km/h. The main difference between the two big Unimog vehicles lies in their axles and frames i.e. their axle loads and the gross vehicle weights which is a maximum of 10.3 tonnes for the U 4023 and 14.5 tonnes for the U 5023. Time-tried cab with a short bonnet radically reworked This cab is first class  it has left its mark on the appearance of the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog since 1974. The designing engineers were confronted with the challenging task of installing technology complying with Euro VI and they succeeded by repositioning the engine one metre further back under the cab and this is now the core of the new concept. In comparison with its predecessor, the new cab has been lengthened by 120 mm and is slightly higher  and by moving the transmission controls from the central console to the pitman arm on the steering column there is much more space in the interior of the cab. This cab has also been upgraded with its new fittings: The multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column, pitman arm control, multifunction touch-keys and instrument cluster with a large display as well as a new stronger heating and ventilation system provide the very best conditions for the driver. The central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" has been redesigned so that the correct tire pressure for the prevailing conditions can be chosen simply and easily in the display with the pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". From the outside the dynamic design of the radiator and the new bumpers with modern headlamps show at the first glance that here there is a new generation of the Unimog on the job. Also the access to the cab is completely new with easy to master and safe steps, two or three depending on what the customer requires. The altered position of the engine also allows power to be taken directly from the engine with an engine-driven PTO so that implements can be run independently of the driving situation unlike the transmission-driven PTOs which are still available. The big advantages of the extremely mobile off-road Unimog such as its outstanding handling over tough terrain remain untouched and in individual points its strengths have been improved. In the new model, the curving of the frame is now further back due to the central position of the engine and altogether the Unimog has a lower centre of gravity while retaining its high ground clearance which is extremely important for off-road operations. As both frame and tubular cross members are welded, this guarantees the extremely good torsional flexibility of up to 600 mm when driving cross-country. The axle articulation of up to 30° is made possible by the torque tube technology combined with the coil springs by connecting the torque tube and the torque ball to the transmission. Portal axles, the low centre of gravity and extremely good angles of approach and departure (at the front 44°, at the rear 51°), and ramp angles (34°) as well as its slope climbing ability (45°) all go to make the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog just what it is  and in addition there is its fording ability of a maximum of 1200 mm as well as its side tilting angle of 38°. Driving in extreme situations is supported by the engageable all-wheel drive, engageable differential locks and the central tire inflation system. Unimog vehicles have a long life and they are robust and reliable. The completely welded frame and the enclosed parts of the chassis stand for the claim that the vehicle is able to stand up to great stress and strain. The axles are reinforced, all important power units and equipment are metal clad or installed in safe positions  and this is also true for fording ability within the guaranteed depth of 1200 mm. Extreme operations the world over All this shows quite clearly just why the outstandingly mobile off-road Unimog has such an excellent reputation all over the world. Working in extreme off-road conditions is the order of the day, whether it is fighting forest fires, for disaster control, crane operations, pipeline construction, expeditions, rescuing man and machine and last but not least for transporting crews and other people  in remote areas where the roads turn into bad tracks and rough terrain, that is where the Unimog U 4023 and U 5023 are on home ground. The Unimog is also looked after perfectly as far as maintenance, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned as competent Unimog Dealers are there to take care of the vehicles in over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries where special service packages and financial services round off the customer care. - END - Unimog U 216 to Unimog U 530: New powerful implement carriers - New entry models Unimog U 216 and U 218 - Work and power hydraulics - World premiere: Smooth changeover from driving with hydrostatic traction drive to manual transmission precisely designed for the job - Unimog versatility: Over 1000 implements and applications The product range of the Unimog implement carrier launched in 2000 is now being presented in the second generation with a new arrangement and new designations. U 216 and U 218 as entry-level models and the U 318 and U 423 are fitted with four-cylinder engines, U 427, U 430 and U 527 as well as U 530 have six-cylinder units. As the end of very work-intensive design engineering, the Unimog implement carriers are now once again at the starting block  more efficient, environmentally acceptable and cost-effective than their predecessors and in addition with their typical features greatly strengthened. New exterior: Panoramic cab with a modern design The panoramic cab presents itself in a new and modern design. Here the optical and functional effect of the short bonnet is emphasised even more by LED lamps including daytime running lamps integrated in the bumpers. To improve visibility, the windscreen wipers have now been fitted on the roof over the windscreen giving a superb view of both road and implements, and improved even more through the new front camera monitor system. Typical for the Unimog: The front power take-off reveals its powerful technology and power-hungry implements. New interior: Operating concept provides the best working conditions Multifunction steering wheel, adjustable steering column and stronger heating and cooling system with improved air flow make both drivers and co-drivers feel happy. The operating controls have been improved so that there is now a steering column pitman arm to operate driving functions such as gear changing or engine brake. The instrument cluster for driver information is new and has a large, light display; the joystick for operating implements can be removed and held in the hand; the uninterrupted view of the front implements  which is also important when attaching or removing them  is made safer with the monitor and front camera; and all this adds up to an appreciable lightening of the driver's load. Using the central tire inflation system ""Tirecontrol Plus"" (optional) is now much easier via the display as it gives the user the choice between pre-programmed modes ""road"", ""sand"" and ""bad surface"". New work hydraulics  more sensitive than ever The new work hydraulics set to precisely and without making any jerking movements  with at the same time about 30 percent increased hydraulic performance. This makes is possible to control the implements more sensitively than ever before. The work hydraulics is completely proportional when working and allows two movements to be performed at the same time via the joystick. The multifunction keys on the steering wheel and the display allow the output to be limited. The hydraulics works with two circuits, whereby Circuit I provides 200 bar system pressure with hydraulic oil flow of 32 l/min, together with Circuit II it adds up to an additional 55 l/min with up to 240 bar. And here the implement drive has been improved even further as the front power take-off now gives a performance of a maximum of 160 kW (up to now 150 kW). New compact entry models: Unimog U 216 and Unimog U 218 The two entry-level models U 216 und U 218 are completely new. They replace the previous Unimog U 20 and are now very little different from the bigger implement carriers above them starting with the U 318. Models U 216 and U 218 also have the same panoramic cab including the adjustable steering column and the other innovations, as well as the well-known unique VarioPilot where steering wheel and pedals can be moved to the other side of the cab when the operator needs to work from the co-driver's seat. The great advantage of the new models is their size with extremely compact dimensions. The wheelbase is only 2800 mm and is thus 200 mm shorter than the U 318, the turning circle is only 12.6 metres in comparison with 13.7 metres  by the way both of these turning circles are what are to be expected of passenger cars. Power is provided by the four-cylinder engines with 115 kW (156 hp) and 130 kW (177 hp). With three different load ratings from 7.5 to 10 tonnes, the payload of the U 216 and U 218 can cope with a great variety of tasks and applications. Unimog U 318 to U 530 Even greater performance, more manoeuvrable, more agile and able to do many more different kinds of job: such an all-round increase in efficiency is the trade mark of the Unimog U 318 to U 530. The engines produce a new peak performance as the 220 kW (299 hp) in the U 430 and U 530 provide the strongest hp output ever realised for a Unimog. The advanced work and power hydraulic systems profit a great deal from the engines. Greater efficiency is also provided by the greater payload. Here it was possible to reduce the weight by making savings on the frame and using aluminium wheels. It was also a brilliant feat to be able to shorten the wheelbase by 80 mm in comparison with the former U 300 despite the complicated components needed for Euro VI (U 318 and U 423). Because of this and with the help of a greater turning angle when steering, the turning circle is clearly smaller than that of its predecessor. New power hydraulics replaces power take-off pumps and special purpose body engines Power hydraulics VarioPower  for a long time this name has been behind the extremely powerful implement drive in the Unimog. Now it is even more efficient. Two circuits, each with 125 litres of hydraulic flow and 280 bar pressure can perform, if required, several different kinds of job at the same time or one especially sensitive operation  up to a top performance of 58 kW per circuit. This advanced design replaces pumps attached to the power take-off or diesel body engines, for example for mounted sweeping machines and this saves fuel, space and weight. And if the power hydraulics is not needed, then the Unimog can save weight in the vehicle frame  it can simply be removed from its installation location to increase the payload. This new system is operated using steering wheel touch-keys and its data can be read in the display in the new instrument cluster. The power hydraulics is available in Unimog models from U 318 on. The new synergetic traction drive The innovative new hydrostatic traction drive for the Unimog implement carrier is also a world premiere and it opens up a whole new range of possibilities for using implements. The combination of hydrostatic and manual transmission allows the driver to change smoothly from one mode to the other while driving. Up to now it was necessary to halt briefly before changing systems. The new comfortable Drive-Work-Mode can be used to advantage, for instance, when mowing grass verges and the work is interrupted by a long noise barrier. The new hydrostatic drive now allows speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph) and the hydrostatic performance has been increased by 20 percent. Whereas infinitely variable driving and working reduces wear on the clutch and increases work performance, driving with the manual transmission saves fuel because of its increased efficiency. When using the electronic pneumatic power shift (EPS), the driver starts the changeover by pressing the clutch and so starts the optional automatic electronic drive control (EAS) to complete the changeover automatically. This new synergetic system is easily operated by using the steering column control switch, hydraulic joystick or alternatively the accelerator. Unimog implement-carrying design: More than a 1000 different possibilities The versatility of the Unimog implement carrier is legendary. In the meantime, more than a 1000 different possibilities are registered. Implement manufacturers worldwide work together intensively with Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks at the Wörth plant - where the Unimog now has its base  to expand the range of operations. The great advantage of the Unimog product range from U 216 to U 530 is its ability to use implements four-fold. There are three attachment points  front, rear and between the axles  as well as the space for mounting bodies and equipment on the chassis. The implements and equipment can be supplied with energy hydraulically, mechanically and electrically. The range of users includes Local Authorities, the energy sector, forestry workers, agricultural logistics, the construction industry or road-rail operators, but the list is long and includes many others. Whether it is working at the airport, cleaning solar parks or clearing snow across the mountains, virtually nothing is foreign to the Unimog and that it is exactly what makes it unique in the world of commercial vehicles - as a versatile implement carrier with the driving qualities of a truck. It also proves its value as a tractor unit with a 40 tonne combination and its technical top speed of up to 90 km/h (56 mph) is absolutely suitable for motorways. Directional stability, precise steering and the use of ABS are responsible for the high level of safety provided by the Unimog. In addition, the extremely good axle load distribution and four same-size wheels have a positive effect on the vehicle's handling qualities. And the Unimog sets its very own standards with the panoramic cab. The panoramic front windscreen, deep drawn down side windows and short bonnet give a very wide view of driving and working areas. What is quite new is the front camera system with a monitor which makes things easier for the driver as it shows him the area directly in front of the vehicle which makes it easier to attach implements. And last but not least, it is the good off-road mobility of the Unimog which speaks for itself: portal axles, high ground clearance, differential locks, single tires and the ability to rock out of dips (Electronic Quick Reverse). As far as servicing, trouble diagnosis or repairs are concerned, the Unimog is well provided for with over 650 service stations in more than 130 countries worldwide where competent Unimog Dealers are ready and waiting with special service offers as well as financial services to round off the entire package.

"Official: Audi testing long-tail version of R18 e-tron quattro for Le Mans Filed under: Motorsports , Hybrid , Audi , Racing Race teams are always looking for ways to shave hundredths of seconds of their lap times. Case in point: Audi is making some slight changes to its prototype racecar to make it ever so much more slippery as it cuts through the air. Debuting at the second round of the FIA World Endurance Championship at Spa on May 4, Audi will be testing a long-tail version of its R18 E-tron Quattro racecar. As its name suggests, the long-tail car gets a lengthened rear section with the goal of improving aerodynamics. The long-tail will be run alongside the standard version of the racecar as a testbed for possible changes that might be in store, heading into the 24 Hours of Le Mans . Audi did not say how many inches were added to the racecar, but as you can see in the image above, ""long-tail"" definitely doesn't take on the same meaning of classic long-tail cars of the past such as the Porsche 917 .

WEC Spa: Audi presents long-tail R18 -First fielding of three Audi R18 e-tron quattro cars -Premiere of a new aerodynamic variant -Last race preparation for the Le Mans 24 Hours Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Audi is pursuing ambitious aims at round 2 of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) on May 4 at Spa. The version of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that was victorious at the season opener is to extend Championship leader Audi's points advantage. At the same time, a new ""long-tail"" variant of the hybrid sports car will be tested in Belgium. Comparison in racing conditions: Two versions of the Audi R18 e-tron quattro that, also visually, can be clearly distinguished from each other will be running at Spa. The winners of the opening round, Loïc Duval/Tom Kristensen/Allan McNish (F/DK/GB), and the current World Endurance Champions Marcel Fässler/André Lotterer/Benoît Tréluyer (CH/D/F), will be starting with the aerodynamic variant that was victorious at Silverstone. It generates optimal downforce for track types such as the 7.004-kilometer circuit at Spa. The third Audi R18 e-tron quattro, driven by Marc Gené/Lucas di Grassi/Oliver Jarvis (E/BR/GB), on the other hand uses an aero package that has been optimized for the high-speed Le Mans track and can be recognized by its lengthened rear section. The comparison, however, is not focused on absolute lap times. Instead, the team will analyze the time differences to be expected between both models on individual track sectors. In addition, practical aspects of using the second body version will be reviewed and data generated for the fielding in the race at Le Mans. The focal point of the spectators' interest will yet again be the thrilling battle between World Champion Audi and challenger Toyota. In the seven meetings that have taken place since last June, the score is at 4-3 for the sports cars from Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm in the competition with Japan. The Spa 6 Hours will be held on Saturday of the first weekend in May. The TV channel Eurosport will cover selected stages of the race whereas the full racing distance can be watched on audi-liveracing.com on the internet. - Will Duval/Kristensen/McNish be able to extend their lead of the standings? - How well will the World Champions Fässler/Lotterer/Tréluyer fare? - How will the battle with Toyota develop? - Which manufacturer will travel to Le Mans with a points advantage? Dr. Wolfgang Ullrich, Head of Audi Motorsport: ""As always, Audi will be using the race at Spa as a 'dress rehearsal' for the Le Mans 24 Hours in June. Spa is a race track with a character that's completely different from Silverstone. We thoroughly reviewed the first race of the season and accomplished our tasks in order to be well prepared for the second round of the WEC. Fielding the Le Mans aero variant on the third vehicle that hasn't been optimized for the lap times at Spa is an important element of the preparation for the 24-hour race."" Ralf Jüttner, Technical Director Audi Sport Team Joest: ""The comparison with our competitor will start from scratch again at Spa. We can expect our opponent Toyota to compete with the latest technological update. For the first time this year, we'll be running with three cars. That means more work for our team. Spa's a great track and a race that definitely belongs on the WEC calendar. The new Audi R18 e-tron quattro was immediately reliable and fast."" Facts and quotes by the Audi drivers Marcel Fässler (36/CH), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Drove the fastest race lap at Spa a year ago - Had to admit defeat at Silverstone by only 3.4 seconds ""Spa's one of my favorite tracks. In the LMP sports car, the circuit is a fantastic challenge. Eau Rouge, Blanchimont and the fast downhill double left-hand turn are particularly nice. Plus I like the ambience in Belgium extremely well."" André Lotterer (31/D), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Regards Spa as his 'home' track - Is the runner-up in the standings after the 2013 season opener ""I grew up in Belgium and went to the track as a child. That's why Spa is always special for me. It's a fast track that should be suiting our car well. My two team-mates really enjoy driving there too. I'm hoping for us to be able to reverse the order of the top two results of the Silverstone weekend."" Benoît Tréluyer (36/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #1 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Winner of the 2013 Sebring 12 Hours - The World Champion was the runner-up in Belgium last year ""For my team-mate André Lotterer, Spa is a 'home' track in a way. We'll be running for the first time now in this year's R18 e-tron quattro and the new tires on this track. Of course we'd like to be on the podium again right after Silverstone  ideally on the top though."" Loïc Duval (30/F), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the Spa 6 Hours in the Audi R18 ultra last year - Leads the standings with his team-mate after the success at Silverstone ""I achieved my first victory with Audi at Spa last year. In May, the weather in the Ardennes is often unstable. Together with Allan and Tom I'd like to repeat the success at Silverstone and extend our World Championship lead."" Tom Kristensen (45/DK), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - The Dane achieved his first victory of the season at Silverstone - Ten years ago, he won at Spa in the Audi R8 ""Spa for us drivers, the cars and the teams is a huge challenge. It's a typical track from a different era with many vertical differences and corresponding compressions, with blind turns and frequently changing weather. The mechanics and all the other team members did an outstanding job at Silverstone. The pit stops and strategy were good. Spa's our last preparation in racing conditions before the biggest competition of the year at Le Mans."" Allan McNish (43/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #2 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Achieved the fastest time in qualifying at Spa last year - At the WEC opener in England, celebrated his first victory in an R18 e-tron quattro ""I always enjoy driving again at Spa. The track follows the topography in an ideal way. That's a hallmark of many good circuits. Some of the world's nicest corners are found at Spa, such as Eau Rouge or Pouhon. The races there are always thrilling, partially due to the weather but also because there are always surprises. The track is rough on the drivers, the car and the tires. In addition, we're expecting the competition at Spa to be tough due to Toyota. We drivers and our engineers have found a very good rhythm of working together."" Marc Gené (39/E), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Won the race at Spa on making his Audi debut a year ago - Has celebrated three sports car victories at Spa since 2008 ""I'm looking forward to one of my favorite tracks that I've won at three times before. For us, it's the big preparation for Le Mans. The weather's often unpredictable. For Oliver Jarvis, Lucas di Grassi and me, it's the only opportunity to adjust to each other in racing conditions. Until now, I've only driven the Audi R18 e-tron quattro in tests. I'd like to repeat last year's victory."" Lucas di Grassi (28/BR), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Is starting his third sports car race with Audi - Was the runner-up in the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""I'm experiencing my first WEC race in 2013 at Spa. I've got fond memories of this legendary circuit from GP2 and Formula 1. There's no nicer track if you're running in a fast car. I'll be starting with two different team-mates than I did at Sebring. We'll be able to gear up now for the biggest task of the year in racing conditions."" Oliver Jarvis (29/GB), Audi R18 e-tron quattro #3 (Audi Sport Team Joest) - Celebrated a class victory with Audi at Daytona in January - Won the Sebring 12 Hours in March ""My sports car career in Audi's factory team began a year ago at Spa. We immediately took a podium. It's a great feeling to return now. After a good race at Sebring I'm traveling to Spa even better prepared than I was twelve months ago. For the first time, I'm running with my two new team-mates. And we're developing the car with special aerodynamics for Le Mans. That'll be our personal warm-up for the 24-hour race.""

There's no other place where you can feel the centrifugal forces within your body as much as you can in Eau Rouge. Spa is the second-longest track after Le Mans and the weather is always changeable in the Ardennes. Eau Rouge remains the greatest single challenge. In Formula 1, due to the smaller engines and lower weight, you run flat-out there but in the heavier sports car Eau Rouge is even more extreme. Good overtaking opportunities exist in La Source, in front of Les Combes, in the double left-hand turn, on the Fagnes passage and in the chicane before the start and finish. The tarmac provides outstanding grip which is why slicks even work well when the track is slightly damp. In 2012, I celebrated my third sports car victory on this track with my team-mates.""

I've seen them race in person and truly amazing. But when they said long tail, I had images of the 917 long tail that truly stuck out a good 18 inches on those rear extensions. Not quite there, but still cool. Also, from the speculation last year, I got the feeling the top speed at Le Mans was due to the hybrid motors on the front axle bogging them down a bit at absolute top speed with extra mechanical drag? As I admit, that was speculation though. Maybe aero really was the limiting factor. Yesterday at 9:48 PM Report abuse Permalink Vorsprung durch Tecknik.

Check out NORRA's press release and a short video about the SRI EV1 below . NORRA ""FORGES THE FUTURE"" THIS WEEK VIA FIRST ALL-ELECTRIC OFF-ROAD RACE CAR TO CHALLENGE THE LEGENDARY BAJA PENNINSULA Since 1967, the National Off Road Racing Association's (NORRA) Mexican 1000 has been a significant environment for creativity and innovation in off-road motorsports. Thanks to the technical and industry credibility of hot rod pioneer and NORRA executive Don Francisco, the unique Baja competition quickly rose to prominence via the participation of stars like of Parnelli Jones, James Garner and Steve McQueen. Why? From its inception desert racing's wide-open environment gave the automotive industry a new forum for brilliant innovators like Vic Hickey to create the original ""Baja Boot"" and the legendary Olds 442 ""Banshee"". That unique hot rodding legacy will return in a wholly unique way as NORRA today announced the entry of the first ever all-electric off-road race car, the SRI EV1 into this week's four-day General Tire Mexican 1000 rally. The fourth annual vintage-flavored on and off-road rally is scheduled to begin on Saturday, April 27 with a pre-event technical inspection, vehicle display and driver's meeting all taking place at the historic bullring in Mexicali, Baja, Mexico. A record field of 150-plus entries (up from 95 last year) will be made up of motorcycle, truck, buggy and sedan classes from an international list of entries, with a unique emphasis on vintage machinery and a distinctive spotlight on hospitality, adventure and fun. The EV1 is a full scale, 100% electric-powered race car built to resemble a modern Class 1 unlimited open-wheel machine. Designed by SRI, SRD and EV West, the car produces 535 HP and 750 ft-lbs of torque. Power is delivered through two 9"" Netgain WarP motors controlled via Evnetics Soliton 1 high performance controllers before being delivered to the dirt via a Mendeola S4D sequential gearbox. Team SRI's goal for the 1,200-plus mile Mexican 1000 is to successfully complete all three of the Special Stages on Day 1 from the start in Mexicali to the first overnight stop at Bahia De Los Angeles before running on portions of the remaining Special Stages throughout the event that fall within the EV1's range. This includes the final ""Secret Stage"" on Day 4 that precedes the official finish line at land's end in San Jose Del Cabo. Structured in a rally format instead of the more tradition, non-stop Baja endurance competition, the NORRA Mexican 1000 offers Team SRI a unique opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the EV1 thanks its multi-day schedule and a series of off-road Special Stages linked via on-road transit sections. Not surprisingly, the new EV1 is a one-of-a-kind hybrid that combines proven off-road racing technology with a cutting edge drivetrain. The Brenthel Industries chassis features a ride controlled by Bilstein Black Hawk 9300 series shocks on BFG Baja TA KR 35x12.50x15 tires balanced and protected with Ride-On TPS on Method Racing Wheels. Driver and co-driver ride in MasterCraft seats and harnesses. Power for the motors is stored in 138, 3.3v 180ah China Aviation Lithium Batteries (CALB) in two ""hot swap"" battery packs each containing 69 cells. Additional power for the car's Racepak, Baja Designs lighting, communications and GPS is provided by a 4-cell battery pack located in the driver's compartment. Total energy stored in the battery packs is 82kWh, enough to power an average home for about a week. ""This is a monumental undertaking that has been 18 solid months in the making,"" explained Strategic Recovery Institute founder Jeffrey Smith. ""Our entire team is excited about what we are stepping forward to do. We are confident that our upcoming Mexican 1000 capabilities demonstration will generate future battery sponsorship to allow the ability to 'hot swap' multiple battery packs andcomplete entire races in the near future."" The unique legacy of the General Tire NORRA Mexican 1000 to motivate and inspire is still alive and well. Like the unique mid-engine four-wheel drive Baja Boot that Vic Hickey built in the 30 days prior to the inaugural NORRA Mexican 1000 in 1967, the SRI EV1 will become living proof that innovation with an eye toward the future is a powerful concept that may never become obsolete. # # # ABOUT THE GENERAL TIRE NORRA MEXICAN 1000 Dubbed the ""Happiest Race on Earth,"" the unique off-road rally was co-created by promoter Mike Pearlman in 2010. Running this year from April 26 - May 1, each day of the rally consists of special stages (unlimited speed timed stages in the dirt) linked together by controlled speed liaison / transit sections (highway).

RIP I don't know if enough of others agree and I guess I'll see by the downvotes but it's concerning me that autoblog is posting anything news relevant with cars. I don't know if I'm one of the few but I come here to get away from tragic news, to enjoy my hobby and get away from politics and the real world which is cruel and ruthless at times. Now anything related to cars, whether it's a death, rape, accident, what next, drive by? and it gets a space here. Why? Is that really automotive news? At first I could somewhat understand the youtube finds even though I don't click them I figure they are light hearted but to come on here and read serious news just because there is a car involved or car in the background just doesn't seem right and doesn't seem fitting. And it's getting more and more space too. There are so many other places for news and tragedies around the world, do we really need to see it plastered here as well in the guise of car news? Yesterday at 4:41 PM Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jimmy's comment Since their motto is ""We obsessively cover the auto industry"" this is very much relevant. What isn't relevant is so many of the other things they post which are loosely related to cars but have nothing to do with the auto industry. 10 hours ago Report abuse Permalink They post everything the can about cars. If you don't want to read the news, don't click on the damn link. 8 hours ago Report abuse Permalink This is horrible, my heart goes out to the family. I will say I'm disappointed at Autoblog's article, though. It seems disingenuous to plaster a huge Nissan logo on the story, and call it ""the second death at the plant in recent years"" (with the undertone of suggesting that the plant is unsafe) when neither death seems to have actually been related to Nissan's procedures or the plant itself. The first one was a truck accident, and the more recent one was a contractor working for another company that 'makes paint systems for Nissan' and was probably in the process of installing the large electric panel that fell. The third article also mentions another accident where a supplier was seriously injured while repairing a machine. All of these things SUCK, but they don't seem to show the plant is unsafe.

Yesterday at 12:56 PM Report abuse Permalink the industry rather have the person die than get maimed, since paying off a life insurance policy is much cheaper than lifetime in medical care. So their policy is to make sure when they are moving the equipment, it is as big as possible and the person has to stand right under it Yesterday at 12:51 PM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to LW's comment If someone gets hurt,and racks up a huge medical bill it can be bad news for the employee. We just had a guy at work get hurt doing a job he was told to do. He fell off a ladder,and hurt his knee. They gave him a certain amount of time to get well,and he didn\'t. The worker had worked there for over 20 years,and was near retirement age. He is also a huge man. I think the company no doubt saw him as a liability. He was outspoken about stuff too which didn\'t help matters. I just thought this was sorry as all get out esp. considering the man has also lost his Dad and a young grandson in the last year or so. Yesterday at 2:20 PM Report abuse Permalink Stuff does happen, but in the corporate industrial safety mindset there is no such thing as an ""accident"", someone is always negligent.

Yesterday at 11:38 AM Report abuse Permalink its rather odd that the Japanese government chooses to go public with this issue now, as Mitsubishi's issue with ignoring problems and refusing to issue recalls goes all the way back to the 70s. less than 20 years ago, they had major issues with their Fuso medium duty trucks and buses having brake failures, killing hundreds of people. the Japanese government ignored the problem for over ten years, until public outcry forced it out into the open. none of these issues could have ever been hidden without coverups and payoffs by Mitsubishi that went to the highest levels in the Japanese Government. facts like this shock many Americans, but graft and corruption are ""business as usual"" in Japan, and many other countries. Japan is not a consumer-protected country, and Japan has no consumer protection agency of any kind. corporations are king, and are ALWAYS right.

Yesterday at 12:55 PM Report abuse Permalink Good to see the Japanese government coming out on the side of the consumer, well done. Mitusbishi just seem so corrupt and rotten it runs rife right though the company, the products design are totally yuk (Pig ugly L200 Triton just so very unpractical, no rear double cab headroom is totally the most useless gormless pick-up truck ever designed). I know folk that have had crankshaft pulley's sheared right off, Mitsubishi just don't want to know, fix the problem whilst still under guarantee, its like trying to ""squeeze blood out of a stone"" process trying to get them to fix anything that is a design flaw and their fault. To now hear they are not being proactive at coming foreword with vital recall information, it just does not surprise me one bit. Used to love their old products like the big boxy spacious practical 7 seater tough bomp proof Pajaro, that used to do so well winning Dakar rally year after year with some really great robust products in the past. Its a shame to see the absolutely abysmal products they put out today, they have very little to offer no wonder they are sinking fast. Yesterday at 10:13 AM Report abuse Permalink The Tri-Star? Why do writers try so hard to come up with cute pet names for Mitsubishi? The name means three diamonds, not stars. It isn\'t the Diamond-Star company either. The vehicle has problems because of the batteries. The batteries come from the same company that makes the batteries that is keeping the Boeing Dreamliners grounded. Yesterday at 10:09 AM Report abuse Permalink Of the smaller Japanese automakers, I respect Mitsubishi and Subaru, because they have kept their factories open in America and still employ people here. I do not respect Mazda, because they shut down their U.S. operations, laid off the workers and are now building a factory in Mexico. Mazda lost me when they did that - it's like spit in the face to the U.S. worker. Some people go out of their way to buy cars that are not built by Americans, so Mazda must be tailoring to that crowd now. Mitsubishi cars are actually very highly rated by Consumer Reports for their reliability and the Outlander Sport (built in the U.S.) recently won the Automotive Science Group Award for best overall small SUV on the market today. The Outlander Sport SE AWD is also the only SUV listed in the 2013 Consumer Reports car buying guide for the best picks in the ""under $25,000"" category. I think Mitsubishi has a marketing problem here in the United States that they need to overcome. Overall, MItsubishi is posting good profits worldwide these days, but they need to build more to tastes in the U.S. to survive here. For starters, they need to change the front grill of the new 2014 Outlander back to the Lancer jet fighter grill, instead of the new look. Maybe I'm out in left field with that opinion, but the new front grill just looks odd and will take away from all of the good changes that they made throughout the rest of the vehicle. Yesterday at 10:08 AM Report abuse Permalink Mitsubishi, as a car company, has been in a slow decline after the breakup with Chrysler. Although the two companies came up with a few very good products, neither had the depth of resources to make the alliance really work. Chrysler has found Fiat, and the merger seems to be working well for both as Fiat has a lot to offer and Chrysler has always been just short of being more than competitive across the market range with one or two ""best in class"" vehicles among a few also ran offerings. Right now the ""Three Diamond"" company has nothing to offer in a merger and I believe they will sell off their commercial vehicle operations and slowly go off into the sun set. I also believe that the Japanese automotive ranks will be thinned out some more as American and other Asian companies eat into their market.

"Tesla announces 'World's Best Service and Warranty Program,' hints at future 500-mile battery Filed under: EV/Plug-in , Tesla Motors , USA Tesla Motors has just revealed the latest edition of it 5-part announcement trilogy . Whereas the previous first installment had to do with the company's new leasing program , this episode is all about service and warranty, comes gift-wrapped in the glittery descriptor of ""World's Best,"" and is accompanied by hints of a future battery upgrade. The new plan improves on the California automaker's service program by adding a valet service that brings you a top-spec Model S Performance - or a Tesla Roadster , if you prefer - to temporarily replace your personal vehicle while it's being serviced. CEO Elon Musk states that this fleet of Model S service vehicles, which will initially number about 100, will ideally be less than three months old and also be available for immediate sale. Like your loaner more than your own car? You can keep it, paying ""a price that is lower by 1% per month of age and $1 per mile"" for your new ride and taking, likely, a similar hit on your trade-in. Musk hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. Not only should the purchase scheme keep the loaner fleet nice and fresh, it may also create a cache of certified pre-owned inventory for buyers who are looking for a deal on a Tesla that starts at $69,900 from the factory, or who would rather not wait a couple months for a new, made-to-order car. As well as no-travel hassle, Tesla has also made its $600 annual service optional without effecting the standard 5-year/50,000-mile warranty. The company has also made the battery portion of the warranty unconditional, meaning that, if you manage to somehow turn it into a useless brick (something that should be quite difficult to accomplish with the Model S ), you will get a replacement unit of equal capacity free of charge. Speaking of battery capacity, during the media call, Mr. Musk also offered some hope for those anxious for packs that hold more energy than the current EPA-estimated 265-mile/85 kilowatt-hour packs now available. In response to a question about upcoming technology improvements, he hinted that a 500-mile battery would not be an unreasonable thing to expect in four or five years. He then added that, eventually, Tesla would likely offer owners the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles with longer-range capabilities. It all sounds pretty good to us, and we can't help but think if this upstart company keeps it up, surpassing sales of the Chevy Volt might seem a minor accomplishment.

It is a lot for regular middle-class folks like us. BUT, the car wasn't made for us. It was made for people who would buy a top-of-the-line Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, etc. Being that Tesla is a brand new company, they've been forced to make their first several models to appeal to only those people who can afford ultra high-end sports cars and luxury sedans (ie. The Roadster and Model S, respectively). This was done because they didn't have enough capitol to roll out the 50,000 vehicles it would've needed to do in order to satisfy that kind of demand. So they started out appealing to the ultra rich on the Roadster and used the capitol on those sales to create the S class. That capitol also allowed them to purchase a state-of-the-art factory and the ability to ramp up production. Now their using the capitol from the S sales to ramp up supercharging stations throughout the US to answer the range issues. They're also coming out with a sport utility version of the S next year and will parley those sales in order to make a much cheaper sedan (comparable to perhaps a BMW i series). The hope is to finally make a sedan perhaps closer to a Toyota Camry. But they will first need to scale up to the type of factory infrastructure that GM, Ford & Chrysler has in order to be able to compete and match the supply with the demand (which is VERY challenging for a small start-up). That being said; if they keep making a quality product, they will be very successful. And deservedly so. As for range being an issue. I think 265-300 miles of range for an electric car that can be charged at night while your sleeping for 75% less than gasoline is AWESOME! DOT statistics show that most people don't drive more than 20 miles per day. On the occasion that you have to take a long trip, there is (and will be many more) supercharging stations with which to charge up. So if you can afford it. My opinion is... Nothing beats this car. 3 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 2 replies to Jonathan's comment Tesla and their battery source have run out of money.

You have already been corrected many times so that means that you are actively creating FUD. Every one of your statements about Tesla can be proven wrong with a minimal amount of research. You are a troll. You are trying to create misinformation. Tesla received all of their loan and are actively paying it back. They have not and will not be asking for any more Federal money. You think you'd be trolling a Ford website since they received 12 times more Federal money than Tesla did. Ford got $5.9 billion for their loan that they will be repaying over the next 25 years! Tesla has vowed to pay back their loan in 5 years. They are currently paying back $15 million every three months with $30 million paid so far. Continued success means that they will continue to pay down the loan. But you are so afraid of them that you would prefer they fail to fit your sick and twisted agenda of fear. You are a cowardly troll.

"Motorsports: Schumacher to drive Mercedes F1 car on Nürburgring Nordschleife Filed under: Motorsports , Mercedes-Benz In advance of this year's 24 Hours of Nürburgring race, and as a ""thank you"" to German motorsports fans, Mercedes-Benz has arranged quite the driving demonstration at the legendary German track. Seven-time Formula One World Champion Michael Schumacher will pilot a the Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 W02 - the team's 2011 F1 car that carried the Silver Arrow name - around the Nordschleife. As far as we know, this will be the first time that an F1 car will have lapped the North Loop since Nick Heidfeld drove a BMW Sauber car around it in 2007. This will be far from Schumacher's first go with the Nürburgring : In 2011 he drove a classic Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196 (pictured above) for a demo lap around the Grand Prix track, and in 2007 he infamously punted a Ferrari prototype on the Nordschleife . There's no word from Mercedes as to how exactly Schumacher will drive for his 'Ring run this time. Heidfeld's lap was slowed massively by his car wearing hard, demonstration tires and for slow-downs to film the event. We have every expectation that Schumi will be subject to the same demands of safety and public relations. Of course, having the all-time fastest lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife in your CV is something that we'd guess might tempt the über-competitive driver, and he'll certainly have the car to make that happen. Stefan Bellof holds the record for the fastest-ever lap of the 'Ring in its current configuration and length, with a time of 6:25.91 in 1983, at the wheel of a Porsche 956. (Niki Luada has the record at the original length, with a lap of 6:58.6 in 1975, in a Ferrari 312T.) Pundits analyzed the fast bits of Heidfeld's 2007 run, and figured his full-pace time, on admittedly unsticky tires, would have clocked in at around 6:12. Again, we're not suggesting that Schumacher will have the green light to drive at full speed, but it does sound as though the now one-year retired driver is amped for the opportunity. Said Schumacher, ""Posting a lap in a modern Silver Arrow on the most beautiful and most testing circuit in the world, what a brilliant mix - it's every motor racing driver's dream!"" We'll keep our fingers crossed on May 19, and hope that the lap is a hot one.

Related Gallery Michael Schumacher To Drive F1 Car On Nurburgring Michael Schumacher to drive 2011 Formula 1 Silver Arrow on Nürburgring Nordschleife Stuttgart, Apr 25, 2013 - Formula 1 record-breaking world champion Michael Schumacher will take to the track in the run-up to the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring on 19th May - A big 'thank you' to loyal German fans - First outing for a modern Formula 1 Silver Arrow at the Nürburgring Nordschleife since Juan Manuel Fangio's victory in 1954 On Sunday 19th May 2013 before the start of the 24-hour race around the Nürburgring, seven-time Formula 1 world champion Michael Schumacher will take to the track. Schumacher will post a demonstration lap on the Nürburgring's legendary Nordschleife in a MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS F1 W02 to say 'thank you' to his fans for their years of loyal support during his F1 career. This will be the first time since Juan Manuel Fangio's victory on 1st August 1954 that a modern Formula 1 Silver Arrow has driven on the Nordschleife at the Nürburgring. Schumacher covered part of the Nordschleife in the last Formula 1 grand prix at the Nürburgring in July 2011, however, that was in a Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrow Stromlinie W196. The W196 was the first Formula 1 Silver Arrow that took Mercedes-Benz to two world titles with Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1954 and 1955 seasons. During this period, including his success at the Nürburgring, Fangio achieved eight wins in all. Long before the start of the Formula 1 world championship in 1950, however, there has been a close connection between Mercedes-Benz and the Nürburgring; an icon was born on 3rd June 1934 when the Silver Arrow had its first outing on the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife in the International Eifel Race. The car was silver because mechanics had worked through the night to strip away the white paint of the brand new Mercedes-Benz W25 racing car, so as not to exceed the maximum permissible weight. The next day, Manfred von Brauchitsch won the W25's debut race, beginning the legend of the Silver Arrow. Michael Schumacher brought his F1 career to a close last year at MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS. In April this year, Schumacher and Mercedes-Benz announced a long-term partnership that goes far beyond motor racing and Formula 1. The record-breaking champion will represent the brand as an ambassador and provide back-up for issues relating to future developments. Intelligence Drive  the safety and convenience system introduced by Mercedes-Benz  is part of his brief. Michael Schumacher: ""I have a lot of fond memories of the Nürburgring and am really looking forward to giving fans and friends from my home town of Kerpen, which is quite close to the Nürburgring, something to remember as they see me drive by. But it will be a fantastic experience for me too, driving along the Nordschleife in a state-ofthe-art Formula 1 Silver Arrow, particularly in view of the fact that the Silver Arrow's legend began here.

"Official: VW confirms development of 10-speed dual clutch, 134-hp/liter diesel Filed under: Audi , Porsche , Volkswagen Each year, the Vienna International Motor Symposium showcases some of the up-and-coming technologies automakers are engineering for the use in passenger cars, and Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorn revealed some big developments VW is working on for its future products. Winterkorn discussed a multi-faceted approach that VW is looking to reduce its fleet fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Some of the bigger news he discussed included a ""high-performance"" diesel engine that will produce 134 horsepower per liter and a 10-speed DSG automatic transmission.

Ross RSS feed Google+ Posted Apr 26th 2013 5:43PM Each year, the Vienna International Motor Symposium showcases some of the up-and-coming technologies automakers are engineering for the use in passenger cars, and Volkswagen AG CEO Martin Winterkorn revealed some big developments VW is working on for its future products. Winterkorn discussed a multi-faceted approach that VW is looking to reduce its fleet fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Some of the bigger news he discussed included a ""high-performance"" diesel engine that will produce 134 horsepower per liter and a 10-speed DSG automatic transmission. While no specific applications were mentioned, we can only hope this is for the Audi R4 we keep hearing about. Another topic he touched on that caused us to perk up our ears was had to do with VW's plug-in hybrid technology.

Scroll down for a press release highlighting the automaker's future fuel-saving initiatives. VOLKSWAGEN PRESENTS FUTURE DRIVE SYSTEMS AT VIENNA SYMPOSIUM -Group Chairman announces 10-speed DSG and high-performance diesel engine -Plug-in hybrid most promising alternative drive system -Natural gas vehicles offer great potential for sustained mobility Vienna/Wolfsburg, 26 April 2013: Today at the 34th International Vienna Motor Symposium Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, gave a forecast of future drive system technologies. Areas of work being focussed on by Volkswagen include the development of a high-performance diesel engine delivering 100kW per litre of displacement and a new 10-speed dual clutch gearbox that reduces fuel consumption. Among the alternative drive systems plug-in hybrids in particular offer great potential. Winterkorn stressed that over the medium and long-term different drive system technologies would exist side by side. These would range from highly efficient internal combustion engines and natural gas systems all the way to hybrids and electric vehicles. On this basis the Volkswagen Group was working towards its declared objective of lowering the European new car fleet's CO2 emission level to 95g of CO2/km by 2020. Winterkorn emphasised that existing internal combustion engines still offer a lot of potential: 'Since the year 2000, we've reduced the fuel consumption of our TDI and TSI engines by more than 30 per cent. I'm convinced that by 2020 we can achieve further increases in efficiency of around 15 per cent.' Factors making this possible, he said, would include enhancement of the combustion process, intelligent lightweight design, innovative operating strategies and optimisation of friction levels and thermal management. Volkswagen also sees great potential for natural gas drive systems: 'The gas engine is environmentally friendly, economical and suitable for everyday use. The technology is fully developed and the vehicles are already on the market.' The best example is the new eco-up! - at 79g of CO2/km the world's most economical natural gas car. The Volkswagen Group will be systematically rolling out natural gas technology with the Golf TGI BlueMotion and the Audi A3 g-tron. Winterkorn: 'We need to make the public even more aware of the benefits of natural gas engines. Everyone needs to play their part in this: carmakers, politicians and the fuel industry.' The variety of drive system technologies is growing: the group-wide Volkswagen modular component system and its flexible architecture enable every kind of drive system to be integrated quickly into the new models. 'Over the coming years we will electrify all vehicle classes in this way and help electrically powered motoring to make the breakthrough,' added Winterkorn. In the medium term the first choice in terms of alternative drive systems is plug-in hybrid technology. This enables a purely electric range of up to 50 kilometres, a high level of suitability for everyday use by virtue of recharging from a socket at home and also complete flexibility for long journeys thanks to an efficient internal combustion engine. The Volkswagen Group's first plug-in hybrids, the Porsche Panamera and Audi A3 e-tron, will shortly be going into full production. They will be followed by the Golf and many other models, such as the Passat, Audi A6 and Porsche Cayenne. Volkswagen also presented at the symposium new technologies that are finding their way into the modular diesel component system's future engine generation. These high-performance diesel engines achieve peak power output of 100kW per litre of displacement and have a variable valve-train assembly, a high-pressure injection system at up to 3,000 bar and combined charging with the innovative e-booster.

Yesterday at 9:19 PM Report abuse Permalink It will be revolutionary if they actually get 134 hp/liter out of a production diesel. My interest is piqued. Yesterday at 7:44 PM Report abuse Permalink This is very interesting. The company that is striving to become #1 (and it already IS number one in some parameters) decided to put R&D money into more than 7-speed dual clutch transmission AND in 140 hp/liter diesel ... what does that tell you? To me, it tells me that proper car will not be built before they get a nice huge return from that investment - which is probably 15-20 years away from today. The proper car having NO transmission and using NO fuel to power 4 electric motors - one on each wheel. Wall St , you better take note. Elon, sorry for your luck.

I have a co-worker who brags about his Ford Freestyle (with ZF CVT) that now has almost 275,000 miles without any engine and transmission problems. Yesterday at 4:03 PM Report abuse Permalink Yes, and they announced a 3,500 NM car some time ago, which turned out to be a lie. They lied about their emissions, their sales, and covered a massive crash-test failure of the A4 in 2012. So allow me to be skeptical about what this main says. Yesterday at 3:26 PM Report abuse Permalink The 10 speed could be good for their ""offroad"" vehicles. Set the 3rd or 4th gear as ""1st"" for road driving and the lower ones could be used for as a sort of pseudo transfer case. High torque, low speed. Doubt it'll happen, i'm just thinking strange **** up. Yesterday at 11:22 AM Report abuse Permalink Yeah...that's work as well as my first Schwinn (geezer alert!) 10-speed. It had maybe three-four useful gears...the others were duplicates or so close that it didn't matter. Same with 27 speed bikes today....squirrely duplicative gears. A little work with a calculator and custom clusters can drop back to a thicker, more durable chain and 4-5 gears on the back and two at most up front...oops, back to 8-10 speeds. But make them wide-ratio. 10 speeds in a car just seems like a CVT with discernible shift points. And don't get me started on ZF transmission reliability and power handling capability or lack thereof. Yesterday at 9:47 AM Report abuse Permalink I think the car companies are engaged in transmission wars. Watch for a company like ZF to go ahead and introduce an 11 or 12 speed transmission, just because people will want to have it in their car to boast about. You have room to grow more gears in a RWD car, but you'd think they would run out of room for the FWD and AWD versions. Yesterday at 9:35 AM Report abuse Permalink 1 reply to strykerzzzz's comment Exactly. We had megapixel wars in cameras to the point when adding pixels (without increasing sensor physical size) lowered the photo quality. Phone screen sizes are making it impossible to operate them with one hand... But moron customers think that higher number is always better.... 22 hours ago Report abuse Permalink 10 speed DSG makes no sense for a possible ""self shifter"" like the R4. would only make sense for an automatic version imho Yesterday at 6:55 AM Report abuse Permalink Dinosaurs evolved to impressive proportions too.

Yes, it is a great car to drive, but it's now the go-to car for lazy rich people too. I feel bad for the good BMW drivers. My brother and roommate have a 3 series and they're responsible drivers, but the number of terrible I'm-above-the-rules BMW drivers outnumber them. I can relate in a way. I've got a GSX-R600, I've never had the front wheel off the pavement, and I gear up every single time I go out.

As a fellow BMW driver I fully understand and appreciate the weight of history and how our forebears worked in large number very hard to give us the reputation we have today. Thanks for not pi*sing it away just like that. 2. To the bicycle driver - I'm sorry you met an idiot. However, please do understand that you are using a public resource, not your private property. Behaving like you own it might (right OR wrong) induce retaliating behavior from your fellow citizens, no matter how they decided to move on that publicly used space (on foot, on bicycle, on moped, on motorcycle, in a car, in a truck, in a minivan, in dump truck, in 18-wheeler ...)
