"For the first time in 16 years, Smithsonian?s National Zoo is celebrating the birth of golden-headed lion tamarin twins"
Small Mammal House keepers reported for duty the morning of Oct.
 7 and observed that 4-year-old mother Lola had given birth overnight and was caring for two infants.
"Earlier this year, she and the twins' 7-year-old father, Coco, were recommended for breeding as part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums? Species Survival Plan (SSP)."
 These babies are the first offspring for both parents.
 Zoo visitors can view the golden-headed lion tamarin family at the Small Mammal House.
Animal care staff closely monitor the family visually but leave Lola and Coco to bond with and care for their infants without interference.
" Keepers have observed Lola carrying and nursing the babies, which appear to be healthy and strong as they hold on to Lola as she explores their habitat."
" Because Lola is cradling the infants close to her body, it may be some time before keepers can determine their sexes."
"The SSP scientists determine which animals to breed by considering their genetic makeup, health and temperament, among other factors."
" Kenton Kerns, assistant curator of the Zoo?s Small Mammal House, is the Studbook keeper for this species."
 Kerns and keepers describe Lola as an outgoing and curious golden-headed lion tamarin who seems to enjoy interacting with enrichment toys and puzzle feeders.
" Coco tends to be more shy and reserved, though he has been more outgoing since the pair were introduced in April."
" Initial ?howdy? introductions between Lola and Coco went well, and the pair bred soon after meeting."
"As part of the Zoo's positive reinforcement training program, Lola is trained to climb upon a scale on keepers? cue so they can monitor her health."
 A recent increase in weight confirmed to keepers that she was pregnant.
" Over the years, the Small Mammal House has celebrated 26 golden-headed lion tamarin births."
"Native to the southern part of the state of Bahia, Brazil, golden-headed lion tamarins live in the tall evergreen broadleaf tropical forests and semi-deciduous forests along the Atlantic coast."
 The greatest threat facing this species is deforestation; they spend the majority of their time from 10 to 33 feet in the forest canopy.
" Much of their habitat has been cleared for agricultural use, including cattle ranching and cocoa plantations."
" Conservation scientists estimate only 6,000 golden-headed lion tamarins are left in the wild."
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers golden-headed lion tamarins endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation in their native Brazil.
"Carnivore keepers at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, welcomed a litter of five cheetah cubs today."
" Five-year-old female Rosalie birthed the cubs at 5:20 a. m. , 8:24 a.m., 9:42 a.m. , 10:33 a.m and 11:17 a.m.  ET."
 The family can be viewed via the Cheetah Cub Cam.
" Ten-year-old Nick, who was the first cheetah born at SCBI, sired this litter."
" Animal care staff will leave Rosalie to bond with and care for her cubs without interference, so it may be some time before they can determine the cubs' sexes."
" The cubs appear to be strong, active, vocal and eating well."
 Keepers will perform a health check on the cubs when Rosalie is comfortable leaving them for an extended period of time.
Staff are closely monitoring Rosalie and her cubs? behaviors via webcam.
 Virtual visitors can observe Rosalie and her cubs on this temporary platform until the cubs leave the den.
" Keepers provided Rosalie with access to multiple dens, so it is possible she may move the cubs to an off-camera location."
"""Seeing Rosalie successfully care for this litter?her first?with confidence is very rewarding,"" said Adrienne Crosier, cheetah reproductive biologist at SCBI and head of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Cheetah Species Survival Plan."
" ""Being able to witness the first moments of a cheetah?s life is incredibly special."
" As webcam viewers watch our cheetah family grow, play and explore their surroundings, we hope the experience brings them joy and helps them feel a deeper connection to this vulnerable species."
"""SCBI is part of the Cheetah Breeding Center Coalition?a group of 10 cheetah breeding centers across the United States that aim to create and maintain a sustainable North American cheetah population under human care."
" These cubs are a significant addition to the Cheetah SSP, as each individual contributes to this program."
"The SSP scientists determine which animals to breed by considering their genetic makeup, health and temperament, among other factors."
 Rosalie and Nick were paired and bred July 9 and 10.
" Keepers trained Rosalie to voluntarily participate in ultrasounds, and SCBI veterinarians confirmed her pregnancy Aug.  16."
" Since 2007, 16 litters of cheetah cubs have been born at SCBI."
"Cheetahs live in small, isolated populations mostly in sub-Saharan Africa."
 Many of their strongholds are in eastern and southern African parks.
" Due to human conflict, poaching and habitat and prey-base loss, there are only an estimated 7,000 to 7,500 cheetahs left in the wild."
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers cheetahs vulnerable to extinction.
"The Zoo?s legacy of conservation work extends beyond the public Zoo in Washington, D.C. , to SCBI in Front Royal, Virginia."
" Scientists at SCBI study and breed more than 20 species, including some that were once extinct in the wild, such as black-footed ferrets and scimitar-horned oryx."
" Animals thrive in specialized barns and building complexes spread over more than 3,200 acres."
" The sprawling environment allows for unique studies that contribute to the survival of threatened, difficult-to-breed species with distinct needs, especially those requiring large areas, natural group sizes and minimal public disturbance."
"SCBI spearheads research programs at its headquarters in Virginia, the Zoo in Washington, D. C. , and at field research stations and training sites worldwide."
" SCBI scientists tackle some of today?s most complex conservation challenges by applying and sharing what they learn about animal behavior and reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration and conservation sustainability."
"This morning, the Smithsonian?s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute celebrated giant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji?s (SHIAU-chi-ji) first birthday with a specially tailored fruitsicle cake."
 Mother Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) and father Tian Tian (tYEN-tYEN) also enjoyed fruitsicle cakes in honor of their son?s birthday.
 The public watched the pandas enjoy their cakes live on the Zoo?s Giant Panda Cam.
"When Mei Xiang and Xiao Qi Ji entered their outdoor habitat at 7:30 a. m., they approached Mei Xiang?s cake first."
 The base of the cake and heart topper were made of frozen diluted apple juice.
" It was decorated with sweet potato, apple, carrot, pear, sugar cane, banana and bamboo."
" Around 8:15 a. m. , they walked over to Xiao Qi Ji?s cake, which was adorned with a giant number 1 on top."
" The base of the cake was made of frozen diluted grape juice and decorated with sweet potato, apple, carrot, pear, sugar cane, banana and bamboo."
"After over 6,700 votes cast, the three black-footed ferret kits at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia have received their names."
"The female kit received the name ?Aster,? in honor of a purple flower that is native to the American Prairie."
 She was named through a public vote on the Zoo?s website.
 Smithsonian National Zoo Members voted for her brother?s name via an e-newsletter poll and chose ?Swifty? in honor of the swift fox.
" Players of the Smithsonian?s National Zoo?s mobile game, Zoo Guardians, chose the name Aspen for the second male kit."
" His name is short for ?quaking aspen,? which is another native plant to the American prairie."
 SCBI carnivore keepers selected nine potential names that reflect black-footed ferrets? significance as a distinctly North American species.
 Voting took place July 20 through July 25.
"Black-footed ferrets were thought to be extinct in the wild until September 24, 1981, when the last colony was rediscovered near Meeteetse, Wyoming."
 Eighteen black-footed ferrets were brought into human care by USFWS and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to prevent the species from going extinct.
" In 1988, SCBI was the first to receive offspring from those 18 and breed black-footed ferrets outside of Wyoming."
" Since their arrival in 1988, more than 1,000 black-footed ferrets have been born at SCBI, including 140 born via artificial insemination."
 More than 350 kits born at SCBI have gone into preconditioning programs for the chance to be released to the wild.
"The Bornean subspecies of Rajah scops owl (Otus brookii brookii), documented in the wild for the first time since 1892, may be its own unique species and deserving of a conservation designation."
" Published April 28, in The Wilson Journal of Ornithology, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center ecologist Andy Boyce reported the rediscovery and photographed this elusive subspecies in the mountainous forests of Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia."
"?It was a pretty rapid progression of emotions when I first saw the owl?absolute shock and excitement that we?d found this mythical bird, then pure anxiety that I had to document it as fast as I could,? Boyce said."
" ?Based on size, eye color and habitat, I knew it was the Bornean Rajah scops owl."
" What?s more, taking into account this bird?s specific plumage characters, known speciation patterns within the Otus genus and phylogeographic patterns of montane birds in Borneo and Sumatra,  Otus brookii is likely its own unique species and further study is needed."
"Scops owls weigh approximately 100 grams (about 4 ounces), equivalent to four AA batteries."
Both subspecies of Rajah scops owl are native to southeast Asia?Otus brookii brookii on the island of Borneo and Otus brookii solokensis on Sumatra.
 Small owls in the genus Otus often show rapid divergence following isolation in this region.
" In fact, the Indonesian archipelago is composed of islands that facilitate species divergence, and Borneo and Sumatra have been particularly prone to speciation events. ="
"The serendipitous discovery occurred in May 2016 as part of a 10-year study of avian life-history evolution at Mount Kinabalu in seven study plots at elevations from 1,500?1,900 meters (about 5,000?6,200 feet)."
" The project was led by T. E. Martin, assistant unit leader and research wildlife biologist with the Montana Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit at the University of Montana."
" While nest-searching in May 2016, technician Keegan Tranquillo notified Boyce, then a doctoral student at the University of Montana, after spotting a roosting scops owl larger and with different plumage than the regularly encountered Mountain scops owl (O.  spilocephalus luciae)."
"?Unfortunately, we are only good at conserving what we know and what we name,? Boyce said."
" ?If this rare bird is endemic only to Borneo and is its own species, conservation action is more likely."
" Our sole sighting during this intensive study confirms this owl lives in mature montane forests, likely above or below the survey area."
" Those elevations are already threatened by habitat loss due to climate change, deforestation and palm oil development."
" To protect this bird, we need a firm understanding of its habitat and ecology."
Almost all data on this species is of the Sumatran subspecies.  
"O. b. brookii?s vocalizations, distribution, breeding biology and population size are totally unknown."
" Despite the lack of information on the species and subspecies, and the apparent rarity of the Bornean taxa, the Rajah scops owl was designated a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature."
"Properly resolving the ecology, distribution and taxonomic standing of O. b. brookii could have important conservation implications toward both subspecies of owls given each would be an island-endemic species."
" Researchers recommend nocturnal surveys in specific elevations to study habitat, record vocalizations and collect blood or feather samples to resolve the taxonomic relationship between O.  brookii subspecies."

"Bird keepers at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia, are celebrating the arrival of a female white-naped crane chick that hatched April 2."
She is the fourth chick for parents Brenda and Eddie and is the 46th to hatch at SCBI.
Animal care staff at SCBI have had great success producing chicks from cranes that have behavioral or physical impediments that prevent them from breeding.
The chick?s parents are one of the only white-naped crane pairs living at the research facility capable of breeding naturally.
"Prior to hatching, scientists confirmed the chick?s sex using DNA samples takenÿfrom inside of the egg."
Keepers are closely monitoring the chick?s development while leaving the experienced parents to bond with their chick without interference.
They report Brenda and Eddie are providing excellent care to their chick.
"There are an estimated 5,000 white-naped cranes living in the wild, and the species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."
